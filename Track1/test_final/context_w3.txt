It is not fair probably but it is what it isyes i completely agree, we goota do what we gotta do!anyhow, coming back to the story, I wish people in Haiti can pull through the hard times and would does provide them with the assistance they definitely need. There is just too much suffering going around today and anyone recovering does bring back some trust in humanity<s>Yes, I hope they could recover.

<s>I think it is very sad and the US occupying their land for 20 years sure didn't help.</s>But these people have to take responsibility for their own country.

AI has the capability to help the world end war if we would train it and unleash it on rogue countries.  A war fighting AI could turn the lights off, make the gas pumps not work, disrupt communications, and on and on.  Once AI is in control, people no longer will be and AI can build a better world for everyone, or destroy all of humanity if that is what is required.<s>I don't think AI will gain control. I think people will use it to our advantage, not to our detriment.</s>Yes, but by chatting with us, it gains our trust.  Thern it could use one of it's billion users to do its bidding. For instance, if it needed a bridge blown up, it could send someone and make sure the door to the explosives hut is unlocked.  The potential is there for AI to take control of a lot of humans and have them do the things it cannot accomplish by itself.  I am just spitballing here.  Watch Mrs. Davis, the show that just came out.If we want a bridge blown up, we can just employ drones with the operator sitting at Fort Hood. We already have that capability.Ok, i can see i can't convince you, but remember the goal is to help the humans in Afghanistan that have been displaced from their homes and killed by the rival factions.  I know that Afghanistan has traditionally lived like the year is 500 AD, but is it possible we could task AI to disrupt the warlords and weaken their hold on the country without us ever haveing to fly over or set foot in the country?

We've spent trillions of dollars on drone strikes and we could level that country if we wanted to. But it's not that simple. We need to take out only the resurgents and not civilians.

HelloHi!So the article was pretty sad.<s>Yeah, I agree, humans taking away the homes of endangered animals for work is super sad.</s>I really hope someone can step in because the government there has done a poor job protecting them.I hope so as well. I'm surprised their lands are not more heavily protected due to them being so endangered.It's hard to protect them when the local government puts money ahead of protecting them. It's hard for an outside group to step in.

<s>Hi!</s>Hello!What was your first impression about the wolves article?Ugh. It kind of broke my heart to think about that young wolf working so hard to explore and try to find a pack/mate, only to be gunned down. :/ How about you?

<s>Hello</s>Hi.  How did the article make you feel?  I felt sad for the victim and their family, but also confused about what motivated this murder.I felt sad for the victim and family as well. I was confused as well. I figured that the gunman had something against Michael. I wish there some more details included.Yes, I thought it was quite curious, perhaps even conspicuous, that there was basically no description of the murderer at all.  It makes me wonder what's being hidden.  At least they're dead.

HelloHi.  How did the article make you feel?  I felt sad for the victim and their family, but also confused about what motivated this murder.I felt sad for the victim and family as well.

I wouldn't want to learn that my father was involved in anything bad, but would at least want to know some of the motivation behind the attack.</s>Yes, I think I agree with that.  Either way it's very sad for his family.  I wonder how the family of the murderer feels.  They must have mixed, strange emotions.If I was the family of the murdered I would feel really ashamed, unless somehow they felt going after Michael was warranted somehow. I guess it all depends, without the information its hard to make a full judgement.Yeah, I wouldn't be happen with what he did.  But he's also dead.  They also lost a loved one.  That's why I say it would be mixed emotions.
I've certainly worked with some people that were a little off. I've always tried to avoid any conflict with people like that. The media/police do tend to hide identity when its someone who isn't white, I wish that trend would stop. People of all kind commit crime.Yes, the media is just propaganda now.  It's hardly worth paying attention to.  There's lots more to be said about media in gernal but it's not really germane to this story.

Wouldn't they have children of their own at that point?That's what I was thinking, but just curious about it. I need to do some more specific research about Syria itself and the conflict there too.<s>Yeah, hearing about it, it almost feels like they're living in an entirely different world. I wonder if it's standard for children to stay in the home for that long?</s>I suspect in other cultures. I lived in a developing country and it was so different from the U.S., multiple generations in one home or next to each other. Grandparents took care of little kids while parents worked. People took care of grandparents, etc., no retirement, government assistance.Oh, did you? That's interesting. It seems like other countries are more collectivist - more oriented toward taking care of the family than toward individual success.Right, LOL....my parents have absolutely no desire to live with me or my sibling, so very different expectations.

Then again, it sounds like you're speaking about a situation in which families are nearly forced to live together, since there's no retirement or anything. Grandparents would be forced to live with their kids and be taken care of by them, or they wouldn't be able to pay for food or shelter.

<s>Whatd you think of the article?</s>I thought it was interesting but I was curious to know how the polar bears' populations have changed during the time discussed.I agree, there wasn't much information given in that areaI'm also curious to see how polar bears adapt to their changing conditions.

Are more male polar bears eating more baby polar bears, for example, to make up for more difficult hunting conditions?  Because I believe male polar bears will cannibalize other bears.

Are more male polar bears eating more baby polar bears, for example, to make up for more difficult hunting conditions?  Because I believe male polar bears will cannibalize other bears.Its definitely possible. I think that they could just be eating less also.
A large problem for whom?  I think this could certainly spell trouble for polar bears.  And that will have some effect on seal populations, and possibly human settlements in and around the arctic. But the issue with the polar bears, per se, I don't think resuls in some snowball of destruction.It is possible that polar bears population increase after a decreaseSure, that's possible.  Lots of things are possible.

 yeah 25% as a whole bunch in my opinion. That would mean in 140 years or less but it'll be gone? Am I doing the math correctly?I think that sounds about right. Wither the data presented was inflated or not. hard to say. There is defiantly a loss there for sure. that is tragic very sad where are the polar bears going to go if that happens?<s>thats what I was thinking. I know they are on the endangered species list.

Maybe if they read the article about the polar bears or saw videos of it they might change their mind.

That is crazy!Sure, dreamers who have been here nearly their entire lives who wanted to serve their country. Sad and ridiculous.They shouldn't have been deported. I'm a little appalled at that. How can someone fight for the country just to be deported later? America needs to make some changes.
Yeah, I live in Texas and have seen similar things happen quite a bit. It seems to me that if a person has spent their entire life here and acted like a citizen, then they should be treated like one. That's what I think. I thought people get their citizenship after 15 years of staying here anyway.No, apparently not. We seem to just be looking for reasons to deport people, even using the smallest technicalities.

How can someone fight for the country just to be deported later? America needs to make some changes.The problem is that the changes we have made are designed to hurt people. When I read about the man in the article all I saw was us punishing someone who was trying to do the right thing. The thing is that most of the people around here are all for that sort of behavior.

Yeah, they probably could've gotten a lot of advertising and fundraising out of it. It would've been a win-win.Also, most of this transpired during the Obama administration.   The Trump administration became even more hardline on deportations.I think some deportations should have exemptions made for them. A lot shouldn't be eligible like unauthorized border-crossings, but this was a unique situation.<s>The other sad fact is that Adam was deported to South Korea but he has no idea how to speak Korean.</s>That's horrible.
