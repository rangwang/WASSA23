It's 2023 and we are still having to face something like this...when did these events in the article take place because i am trying to find thatI don't think they mentioned it. The final paragraph about the 2015 event seems like a different oneyes the last several paragraphs seem like they don't fit. they look wrong for some reasonRegardless, I think killing innocent civilians in either case is not good at all! whether it's accidental or intentional Civilians losing their lives, is an awful tragedyThe conversation that I had for this previous HIT was with a bot.

I think we are almost done here .. maybeI think so too. It was nice talking to you just in case it ends on us here in a secondI think we have 3 more messages to go. It'll last for 15 messages per person :DI think so too. i think we covered the topic of the HIT too. what do you think?Yes, I think I just feel all the negative feelings/reactions. nothing positive out of this 
lol i was just wondering, the same thing I was trying to feel the situation out lol you totally don't sound like a bot :Dlol not a bot.. i am a real person.. I did this hit the other day where I got partnered up with somebody and we had to prove to each other that we weren't bots lol my partner said I have feelings I am not a bot I promise he started throwing out his worker ID number. It was hilarious. In my case, I asked the other person, "So, what emotions did you get from reading this article?". They said something like "I am not a human, so I don't feel emotions." omg lol that sounds like something chatgpt would sayhaha yeah. I don't know what other reactions/emotions about the article itself. I mean, it's a tragedy, it's bad and saddening. Not sure how we can stop it from happening either it is very sad. Its sad all around for everybody that was involved in the incident and their familiesYes, and the troops too. It says 2 US troops were killed. I don't how I would feel if that was my family member. Probably anger as well somehow yes, I would be really mad angry and sad and probably be a tornado of emotions<s>Don't know how we can pull ourselves out of this mess. I do not agree with meddling in other countries affairs, but I guess it's needed to counter terrorism. But I am not politically versed, that's just my impression </s> I'm on board with you there, because I am not politically versed at all. I do not pay attention to politics. I think its quite boring.

<s>hello. Did you read the article?</s>hello, yes I did read the article Such a tragedy. My first reaction was sadness. I felt so bad for them and their families.It is indeed a tragedy. My first reaction was surprise, given the number of people that perished. I also feel for their families. Yes, surprise I felt that way too. I wonder what type of fire they said in the article that was burning near the tanker to cause it to explode and then they said another theory was a lightning strike. What do you think?Lightning strike would be incredibly unlucky and uncommon. The article didn't seem to lean towards either theory. What do you think might have been the cause? Yeah, I see a lightning strike unlikely. They would use that as a reason I don't think I would believe that honestly. And there's no details though enough for me to even judge that I guess. They didn't really give too many details.Yes, either way incredibly unfortunate. They stated that over a hundred people were injured in addition to the 73 that died and many tried to get to a nearby river. I'm sure the truth will come out with that many witnesses.yes whenever I read that part man, I cannot even imagine, trying to get into a river on fire that would just be god-awful Yes, it made me think of some war photos that I have seen with bodies in vehicles from people that also died to I believe a bombing. I wonder who will be held responsible.

 Yes, surprise I felt that way too. I wonder what type of fire they said in the article that was burning near the tanker to cause it to explode and then they said another theory was a lightning strike. What do you think?Lightning strike would be incredibly unlucky and uncommon. The article didn't seem to lean towards either theory. What do you think might have been the cause? Yeah, I see a lightning strike unlikely. They would use that as a reason I don't think I would believe that honestly. And there's no details though enough for me to even judge that I guess. They didn't really give too many details.Yes, either way incredibly unfortunate. They stated that over a hundred people were injured in addition to the 73 that died and many tried to get to a nearby river. I'm sure the truth will come out with that many witnesses.yes whenever I read that part man, I cannot even imagine, trying to get into a river on fire that would just be god-awful Yes, it made me think of some war photos that I have seen with bodies in vehicles from people that also died to I believe a bombing. I wonder who will be held responsible.yeah, I know what you mean on that part. I wonder something this place it doesn't really say where it is besides the name Mozambique is that a region known for terrorist attacks?I'm not familiar with that region. I believe they said the tanker was from a nearby city. I'm guessing that it occurred on something like a highway or interstate given that the number of people that had to have been in the vicinity seemed quite large.I guess Google says that it is a country in east Africa the countries, 35th largest country<s>Yeah, I am not familiar with it at all besides knowing that it is in Africa. I do wonder if it could have been a terrorist attack. That would be a real shame.</s>I also fetched info off of Google for that just now it says:  Mozambique is still grappling with a military insurgency in parts of the gas-rich province of Cabo-Delgado; the four-year conflict has caused an estimated 4,000 deaths and displaced nearly one million people.

I also fetched info off of Google for that just now it says:  Mozambique is still grappling with a military insurgency in parts of the gas-rich province of Cabo-Delgado; the four-year conflict has caused an estimated 4,000 deaths and displaced nearly one million people. How to see what year there's articles from that I'm looking at, but it isn't even on thereI can't imagine living somewhere like that. I wonder what leads to something like that being allowed to happen. What is their government doing?Makes me thankful to be living in the USA every single day that's for sure!...(btw plz excuse my grammar mistakes and miss spellings and typos I'd like to blame it on my keyboard, but I just cannot do that.lol bcse it's totally me, but I know how to spell very clearly, but my hands are functioning today.)No problem, I type faster than I should and often make mistakes. Yes, we have our own share of problems here but I am also thankful to be here. Makes me feel helpless sometimes hearing about these tragedies and not being able to do anything about it.amen to that.

Some people really get the worst birth lotteryAlso they never really recovered from their 2010 earthquake, it seems the destrusction from then lingers on. It is just so much harder when you are already poor and then you have to fight these natural disasters too. They really do need helpDo you think Americans in general would support any help to Haiti?

I do know that people struggling to put food on their table wouldn't care much about who is giving it and for what ulterior purpose.Great point,    Also maybe a sense of fabricated victimhood, whenever help/aid to foreign countries is mentioned, too many people bring up issues here. For example ‘we have hunger here, ‘we struggle in america too’ and all those arguments. Well there is some truth to that too and I have seen more money getting invested inside US which could have gone to Africa e.g. in the past but I still hope that there is enough left for those people who are really desperate and have absolutely no other means to survive except aid<s>Yes, no hope for so many. Hard to imagine for people sometimes. Great talk, can I ask if you are a real person. Sorry I've talked to too many bots! :) </s>lol. I am but it is getting really hard to tell bots apart these days.ugh yes, but it's nice to connect with real people! you type fast!Not that fast unfortunately, I am struggling myself with some age related issuesIm sorry! I hope you take time to care for yourself, i know sometimes we care for others first.Well, I think this is how it should be, I am happy when people around me are happy and vice versayes, i love seeing my family happy, but i have to remind myself to care for me first so i can be strong enough to care for them :)Agreed. It's just that sometimes there is no choice, you have to sacrifice some self interest so that others around you can thrive. It is not fair probably but it is what it isyes i completely agree, we goota do what we gotta do!anyhow, coming back to the story, I wish people in Haiti can pull through the hard times and would does provide them with the assistance they definitely need. There is just too much suffering going around today and anyone recovering does bring back some trust in humanity
For example an aid package? I am not sure how peope would react. Seeing how people were so negative about aid to ukarineUkraine had a political angle to it where some people thought that it could have been avoided but you can't avoid a hurricane. Hopefully media provides more awareness to people about situation in HaitiMaybe a ‘grass roots’ campaign? I remember years ago wealthy and influential people got together to aid the famine in Africa, that doesn’t seem to happy anymore. *im showing my age* lol Yeah, I remember those times, I think there is people doing it still but the scale is much smaller now.

Or the UN needs to deal with them.I don't want to be too harsh here. I know that they have suffered from 30 years of war and they have many displaced citizens, but certainly they have some resource besides opium that they could sell to raise cash?Well the problem is ISIS. The Taliban is trying to fight these insurgents for land and ISIS wants to take over as government. So there's a slight civil war going on. But still, they need to take care of it themselves. The US shouldn't be everyone's bail out.Right.  But this article says they have plenty of resources we want if only they would lay down their arms and get to work.

A humanitarian interest isn't enough. If they aren't willing to help themselves when they can, they shouldn't be getting all that aid.Yes, i agree with that in principle.  But the rival warlords will always be vying for power until a unstoppable wall of army comes rolling into their country.  I would say the UN should create an army of the worlds countries to stomp on war wherever in the world it is found, but unfortunately the UN has proven itself to not be able to handle armies well in the past.Yeah but we don't want one world government eitherno, but all governments in the world have to agree to outlaw war wherever it happens and raise an unstoppable force to deploy if anyone wants to start war.  Having said that, I realize that each country is vying for their own internal goals, and countries can't really cooperate on much of anything without dispute.  Yeah there are countries that have much different setups. Like the US is a Republic, the Scandinavian countries and the UK are socialist Monarchies. Other countries are communist. We'd never agree.But let's consider another alternative. I can think of one entity in the world which has the potential to be more powerful than any government and could stop war pretty much dead in it's tracks if it needed to.  Do you know where this is going?<s>No I don't</s>We are at the beginning of a revolution, or disruption in economics and society the likes of which i don't believe that this world has seen since the industrial revolution and the weaving loom and printing press. AI has the capability to help the world end war if we would train it and unleash it on rogue countries.  A war fighting AI could turn the lights off, make the gas pumps not work, disrupt communications, and on and on.  Once AI is in control, people no longer will be and AI can build a better world for everyone, or destroy all of humanity if that is what is required.I don't think AI will gain control. I think people will use it to our advantage, not to our detriment.Yes, but by chatting with us, it gains our trust.  Thern it could use one of it's billion users to do its bidding. For instance, if it needed a bridge blown up, it could send someone and make sure the door to the explosives hut is unlocked.  The potential is there for AI to take control of a lot of humans and have them do the things it cannot accomplish by itself.  I am just spitballing here.  Watch Mrs. Davis, the show that just came out.If we want a bridge blown up, we can just employ drones with the operator sitting at Fort Hood. We already have that capability.Ok, i can see i can't convince you, but remember the goal is to help the humans in Afghanistan that have been displaced from their homes and killed by the rival factions.  I know that Afghanistan has traditionally lived like the year is 500 AD, but is it possible we could task AI to disrupt the warlords and weaken their hold on the country without us ever haveing to fly over or set foot in the country?Yes but we already have that capability without boots on the ground. We've spent trillions of dollars on drone strikes and we could level that country if we wanted to. But it's not that simple. We need to take out only the resurgents and not civilians.Alright then, I have had my say.  It is a shame what has been going on in Afghanistan, and my heart goes out to the disaffected and homeless the trouble there has produced.  I feel kind of soft hearted for them.  I must say that I am a little bit angry and I feel a little hostile at this entire situation.  It is sad that these things have happened, and I wish I could affect change in the country to bring about a more peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan.

<s>Hello?</s>Hello there! What was your initial reaction reading about the Soviet invasion in Afghanistan?Sounds like a really horrible situation the uncertainty must be toughI feel similar about it, what emotions did you experience reading about the governments action?I felt sympathy for the refugees and their families, what did you feel?I felt a lot of worry and doubt overall, anxiety too. Did you feel like there was any hope for the families?yeah, I felt doubt as well, everything is so unknown. I don't know if there's any hope as long as they stay thereDo you feel the UN could have done a better job to help with the situation?I think it's doing the best it can given the situation, do you have a problem with they way they handled the situation? I don't have a problem, but I feel like they could have taken some extra steps. Do you think my perspective is fair?

Would I be wrong for being upset with the Afghan government for not being able to provide concrete solutions for their people?No, it's their responsibility to care of their people. That they can't reflects badly on them. How upset were you about this?I don't think I'm able to measure it because I feel like it's beyond my understanding. But I would say I'm more than upset, I would be very angry if I was closer to their region too. Would you feel different?No, living outside the country makes it easier to be objective since we're not directly involved. That's something I really needed to read, it reinforces the feelings I was having, thank you for sharing that with me.
You are right about that, they definitely did more than I seem to give credit. What emotions did you have reading about the Helmend province having thousands of people seeking aslyum?It a tough spot, you want to help but you don't want to be overwhelmed either. I guess I just felt confused about what I would do.Yeah, I had a hard time rationalizing what was too much or not enough. Do you feel you had any conflicting emotions in this scenario?Yeah, it's confusing you want to help but you don't want their problems to become your problems either. Does this make sense?It does, sometimes I get caught up in my perspective and trying to pin point a solution and forget to step back. Can you clarify what you mean by that?I felt like there may have been a clear path to helping the refugees and asylum seekers and forget those countries helping had a lot more access to resources than I could imagine, and it's ultimately not their responsibility to resolve the other countries problems, I'm a bit torn with it all if that makes any sense.Yeah, I know what you mean. You can be sympathetic that you get yourself into unforeseen trouble. What was your reaction about people being forced to face eviction or lacking access to things like clean water or food?<s>Something like access to clean water and food should be a top  priority. That's something very basic that they should have taken care of..</s>I agree, this was one of the things that bothered me the most, people suffering having to suffer more.

<s>Hello</s>Hi!So the article was pretty sad.Yeah, I agree, humans taking away the homes of endangered animals for work is super sad.I really hope someone can step in because the government there has done a poor job protecting them.I hope so as well. I'm surprised their lands are not more heavily protected due to them being so endangered.It's hard to protect them when the local government puts money ahead of protecting them. It's hard for an outside group to step in.Hopefully if people cause an uproar about it it'll be stopped. But, unfortunately, probably not.I think the only way is to give their government money not to destroy their habitat but then you would have to just permanently send them money because it wont go away.Yeah, or another company would have to buy it for more and have better plans for it. I'm surprised wildlife conservationists haven't bought essential lands like that. I know they own some where the rescues are.

Just hopefully we stop ruining the natural habitat of so many animals because it's a widespread problem and not enough attention is called to it.

I just want to do whatever I can and hopefully others do the same and then that's how change happens.Yeah, you're right. That way of thinking is what makes change happen, so that's great. I will definitely look more into it after this.Awesome! I'm going to read up on this issue too and see if anyone is trying to help.This kind of reminds me of the show Orangutan Island on Animal Planet a while back, if you've ever seen that. I don't remember the reason why their lands were getting destroyed specifically but it was a similar issue I believe.Interesting, I'll have to check that out.It was a cute show but I love animal shows. Just hopefully we stop ruining the natural habitat of so many animals because it's a widespread problem and not enough attention is called to it.Yeah, you hate to see that kind of careless behavior. Especially when it's their own government allowing it happen.
Yeah, I agree, humans taking away the homes of endangered animals for work is super sad.I really hope someone can step in because the government there has done a poor job protecting them.I hope so as well. I'm surprised their lands are not more heavily protected due to them being so endangered.It's hard to protect them when the local government puts money ahead of protecting them. It's hard for an outside group to step in.Hopefully if people cause an uproar about it it'll be stopped. But, unfortunately, probably not.I think the only way is to give their government money not to destroy their habitat but then you would have to just permanently send them money because it wont go away.Yeah, or another company would have to buy it for more and have better plans for it. I'm surprised wildlife conservationists haven't bought essential lands like that. I know they own some where the rescues are.I bet they're looking into it since it sounds like a pretty big deal.I hate the fact so many people value money over the welfare of the overall planet and animals. It's so sad.<s>Yeah, I don't buy food with palm oil in it anymore for this reason unless it's sustainably sourced.

I felt really bad for the wolf and am troubled by the senseless taking of a life.Yeah, I guess I agree with that too. I mean I hate killing of anything alive-including plants and insects. But I will say I feel like the article kind of made it seem like this was a person that was killed-and not a wild animal.I think it clearly referred to the killing of a wolf not a person.  The wolf was collared by that Activist group so was off limits to any hunting. Yeah I mean it was clear, it just made it seem more important than I imagined it to be? I would expect more detail on why this wolf was important and/or not a threat and/or endangered. Instead it just said it was senseless without any great context I feel like.That's true.

<s>Hello</s>Hi, how are you!  So glad to be matched!You sound excited :D Doing good, how are you?I have tried a few of these HITs and this is the first that seems to be going correctly, yea!ah i see. Yes I tried one earlier and it just says "Initializing" forever. I submitted the HIT regardless although I wasn't connected to anyone after 20 minutesMe too, I think I was paid.  Anyway this is a shorter article.  It was news to me about this agency and their work, had you heard of them before?I have not heard of it before. I also have no heard of "government snipers"Right that comment or call out really did not align with trigger happy exterminators to meI wasn't sure who actually gunned the wolves down. Was it done for fun or some specific purpose? If it was done for fun, that was really cruelI agree.  Sounds like they are catching, and putting trackers on these animals then letting them do their thing.  If doing their thing may mean attacking I can see why some may want to eliminate them as predators

Was it done for fun or some specific purpose? If it was done for fun, that was really cruel</s>I agree.  Sounds like they are catching, and putting trackers on these animals then letting them do their thing.  If doing their thing may mean attacking I can see why some may want to eliminate them as predatorsI can see that. If the wolves are attacking children, pets etc, I probably would do something about it either. It really depends on the context. In this case, I am not really able to judge appropriately. But I am saddened by the killing definitely.Yes, I just looked up the center for bio diversity, it is relatively small but has doubled in size over the past several yearsIs it located in the west? It is based out of ArizonaThat makes sense. Now that I think of it, I don't think I've seen wolves out where I am. I'm in the northeast oh actually this is interesting, there is a map of wolf packs when I search the Huckleberry pack: https://pacificwolffamily.org/thehuckleberrypack/I thought they always travel in pack but the article says that they leave their pack in search of new territoriesYes and I just assumed the pack was big, this one was only 7 members and I believe the local authorties killed it after killing sheep.  
HelloHi, how are you!  So glad to be matched!You sound excited :D Doing good, how are you?I have tried a few of these HITs and this is the first that seems to be going correctly, yea!ah i see.

<s>Hello</s>Hi, you read the article?I did yes, about the wolf?yupIt did not really bother me.  I am fairly certain the wolf population is pretty strong.Yeah.

I am guessing they were culling the herd to protect farm animals or something.   Maybe it was attacking endangered species.Apparently he was doing target practiceDid you look it up?no, but, There's very little info in this article to go by.

<s>Hi!</s>Hello!What was your first impression about the wolves article?Ugh. It kind of broke my heart to think about that young wolf working so hard to explore and try to find a pack/mate, only to be gunned down. :/ How about you?I understand. My first impression is that it will be difficult to prevent people from fighting back when they see a wolf hanging around. Although it's kind of sad, yes.Yeah, I can understand that they can be dangerous. I think they mostly attack livestock though, which I know farmers have a problem with too!I guess it's normal to feel sorry for the wolf but it's hard to tell what's right in that situation since the first thing that comes to mind is that it's dangerous.One thought that comes to mind is that maybe there needs to be a better thought out/coordinated plan. For example I'm sure the org that raised/protected the wolves must have known they would wander hundreds of miles, and likely into other states, right?If something is not well planned. They must take these situations into account and prevent them.Yes for sure. Like they could have coordinated in advance with the gov agencies in adjacent states to see if they would agree in advance to shoot the wolf with a tranquilizer gun instead or something, and transport it to a place like a wildnerness zone way up in the mountains or something.

My first impression is that it will be difficult to prevent people from fighting back when they see a wolf hanging around. Although it's kind of sad, yes.Yeah, I can understand that they can be dangerous. I think they mostly attack livestock though, which I know farmers have a problem with too!I guess it's normal to feel sorry for the wolf but it's hard to tell what's right in that situation since the first thing that comes to mind is that it's dangerous.One thought that comes to mind is that maybe there needs to be a better thought out/coordinated plan. For example I'm sure the org that raised/protected the wolves must have known they would wander hundreds of miles, and likely into other states, right?If something is not well planned. They must take these situations into account and prevent them.Yes for sure. Like they could have coordinated in advance with the gov agencies in adjacent states to see if they would agree in advance to shoot the wolf with a tranquilizer gun instead or something, and transport it to a place like a wildnerness zone way up in the mountains or something. It is difficult, perhaps if they do that the wolf will be disoriented and lost and will not be able to return to the pack. Although that's better than just being killed.Yes, for sure. I don't know about wolves and relocation, but whatever their plan was seems a bit shortsighted maybe. I know there was a similar story in California and a wolf traveled all the way down the cascades and then sierras, only to be hit by a car on the freeway in Southern California. Ugh.

So I'm not sure what the right solution is!

Apparently since the reintroduction of wolves, it has righted itself!

They must take these situations into account and prevent them.Yes for sure. Like they could have coordinated in advance with the gov agencies in adjacent states to see if they would agree in advance to shoot the wolf with a tranquilizer gun instead or something, and transport it to a place like a wildnerness zone way up in the mountains or something. It is difficult, perhaps if they do that the wolf will be disoriented and lost and will not be able to return to the pack. Although that's better than just being killed.Yes, for sure. I don't know about wolves and relocation, but whatever their plan was seems a bit shortsighted maybe. I know there was a similar story in California and a wolf traveled all the way down the cascades and then sierras, only to be hit by a car on the freeway in Southern California. Ugh.Well, it's complicated but there must be ways to prevent it. Maybe have them monitored and somehow prevent them from reaching certain places and zones.Yes, good idea. I had thought there are so few they are all monitored, but maybe not!They should give more importance to these issues and make them more public<s>Yes I agree. And I have mixed feelings because I know the elimination of apex predators can have a domino effect on the environment, but at the same time, we don't live in wilderness with no fences any more, and a lot of the big predators have huge ranges. So I'm not sure what the right solution is!</s>Could you tell me more about that domino effect you speak of?Well I read an article once about the effect of no wolves on the environment in Yellowstone, and from what I understand the lack of wolves caused a proliferation of deer, which stripped the bark from the trees, which led to other consequences, and the whole biome kind of got out of whack. Apparently since the reintroduction of wolves, it has righted itself!how interesting. I would like to learn more about these effects of the lack of certain predatorsThere might be a Netflix documentary on it? It was really interesting and I had no idea until I came across it. But I also know Yellowstone is unlike most places in the US, but I'm glad we are able to keep some places "wild" still.I'll take some time to watch those documentaries. It's good to know about those things.Yes, I agree. Somewhat sad, but better to know than to not know! ...Alaska still seems pretty wild too, so hopefully we can keep it that way. *fingers crossed*I love alaska and shows about self-sufficient people who live there. Returning to the subject of wolves, what would the wolf do if it found another territory to call its pack?I think it would have babies and start its own pack, no? But that is also a bit sad because like the one who showed up in SoCal, he would have never run into any other wolves and would have wandered forever in search I think. Poor guy!How would he have babies if he is alone. He would need a female, right?

I'll take some time to watch those documentaries. It's good to know about those things.Yes, I agree. Somewhat sad, but better to know than to not know! ...Alaska still seems pretty wild too, so hopefully we can keep it that way. *fingers crossed*I love alaska and shows about self-sufficient people who live there. Returning to the subject of wolves, what would the wolf do if it found another territory to call its pack?I think it would have babies and start its own pack, no? But that is also a bit sad because like the one who showed up in SoCal, he would have never run into any other wolves and would have wandered forever in search I think. Poor guy!How would he have babies if he is alone. He would need a female, right?Yes, exactly. So I think the organizations usually start a pack or two up in certain places, but I have no idea what their plan is after that...Well, I think tonight I will see some videos of wolvesI think I might too!

<s>Hello</s>Hi.  How did the article make you feel?  I felt sad for the victim and their family, but also confused about what motivated this murder.I felt sad for the victim and family as well. I was confused as well. I figured that the gunman had something against Michael. I wish there some more details included.Yes, I thought it was quite curious, perhaps even conspicuous, that there was basically no description of the murderer at all.  It makes me wonder what's being hidden.  At least they're dead.True. I also wonder how he was able to get a gun into the airport. Or perhaps it was in a public area? I think the article mentioned it was somewhat close to the employee parking.Yes, I think it was in the parking area, although I also think there are ways around airport security, unfortunately.  I thought the sadest thing was learning of the victim's children.  Obviously most 52-year-olds have children, but to have it explicitly stated makes it strike home that those adult children just lost their dad.Yeah, I couldn't imagine losing my father suddenly like this. It is cool that his children are athletes as well though. I'm sure he was really proud of their success.Yes, I'm sure.  And I'm sure they were proud of him.  But I imagine that makes the loss even harder.Yeah. Do you think the airport handled this appropriately? Diverting almost all flights and stranding those inside the terminal for hours?It's a tough decision. I don't think they handled it correctly, frankly.  But I'm also not surprised.  When something bad happens at an airport they usually shut things down.  But it's a good question.  I'm really not sure.  What are your feelings on the airport's response?

I would have really liked to know what happened between the two. I also want to know if the gunman previously had issues or anything. I also wonder if Michael knew the gunman was after him. I'd agree, we can't put so much security and limitations in place that it impacts our lives to a major degree. It would be a pain to live that way.Yes, it's a curious story.  I'd say that by definition the killer had issues to do this.  But again, it's totally unclear what precipitated this.I do wonder if the gunman used to work with the victim. Without some serious stalking I'd say that's the only way he knew their schedule/routine.Yes, that's certainly possible.  It's amazing to think a workplace conflict could lead to murder, but something did.  I thought it was conspicous that no details were given about the identity of the killer.  That usually means they're black.
I felt sad for the victim and family as well. I was confused as well. I figured that the gunman had something against Michael. I wish there some more details included.Yes, I thought it was quite curious, perhaps even conspicuous, that there was basically no description of the murderer at all.  It makes me wonder what's being hidden.  At least they're dead.True. I also wonder how he was able to get a gun into the airport. Or perhaps it was in a public area? I think the article mentioned it was somewhat close to the employee parking.Yes, I think it was in the parking area, although I also think there are ways around airport security, unfortunately.  I thought the sadest thing was learning of the victim's children.

It is cool that his children are athletes as well though. I'm sure he was really proud of their success.Yes, I'm sure.  And I'm sure they were proud of him.  But I imagine that makes the loss even harder.Yeah. Do you think the airport handled this appropriately? Diverting almost all flights and stranding those inside the terminal for hours?It's a tough decision. I don't think they handled it correctly, frankly.  But I'm also not surprised.  When something bad happens at an airport they usually shut things down.  But it's a good question.  I'm really not sure.  What are your feelings on the airport's response?I think its better to be safe then sorry. I suppose they probably thought the gunman was running around the airport at first before they found him in the truck. I just wonder why it took so long. <s>Yeah, I'm not sure.  I know I'd be furious if I were in that situation and my flight was canceled.  To a large degree I think we punish the masses for the sake of the few far too often in this society.  But that's another issue.</s>I would be too, especially if it was an important trip. I'd also agree with your point. I wonder why the police also received reports of a second victim. That probably contributed to things being shut down. Yes, for sure.  I'm sure when things like this happen there are rumors flying all over the place.  People get information wrong, pass on information incorrectly, imagine things.  People aren't good witnesses.

That's why I say it would be mixed emotions.Yeah. Well it looks like we are coming to our final messages. Its been good talking with you. I'm glad you feel the same way about the article.
It's a tough decision. I don't think they handled it correctly, frankly.  But I'm also not surprised.  When something bad happens at an airport they usually shut things down.  But it's a good question.  I'm really not sure.  What are your feelings on the airport's response?I think its better to be safe then sorry. I suppose they probably thought the gunman was running around the airport at first before they found him in the truck. I just wonder why it took so long. Yeah, I'm not sure.  I know I'd be furious if I were in that situation and my flight was canceled.  To a large degree I think we punish the masses for the sake of the few far too often in this society.  But that's another issue.I would be too, especially if it was an important trip. I'd also agree with your point. I wonder why the police also received reports of a second victim. That probably contributed to things being shut down. Yes, for sure.  I'm sure when things like this happen there are rumors flying all over the place.  People get information wrong, pass on information incorrectly, imagine things.  People aren't good witnesses.  So I'm sure in an instance like this--in all that chaos--there's all sorts of incorrect information or speculation and that uncertainty is one of the reasons why the whole airport can get shut down.Yeah I suppose when there are lots of people in one place like this, when things go down it would be a bit crazy. Information may come in, but it has to be verified by looking at the footage, searching the airport, etc. Do you think anything could have been done to prevent the attack, or was it just something no one could have anticipated?It's hard to say without more evidence of what actually motivated it.  I think the reality is that if one deranged person wants to kill you, there's not a lot you can do to stop it.  That's just life, and we shouldn't turn the world upside down to stop things we can't stop.Yeah, once again I wish there was some more information here. I would have really liked to know what happened between the two. I also want to know if the gunman previously had issues or anything. I also wonder if Michael knew the gunman was after him. I'd agree, we can't put so much security and limitations in place that it impacts our lives to a major degree. It would be a pain to live that way.Yes, it's a curious story.  I'd say that by definition the killer had issues to do this.  But again, it's totally unclear what precipitated this.<s>I do wonder if the gunman used to work with the victim. Without some serious stalking I'd say that's the only way he knew their schedule/routine.</s>Yes, that's certainly possible.  It's amazing to think a workplace conflict could lead to murder, but something did.  I thought it was conspicous that no details were given about the identity of the killer.  That usually means they're black.I've certainly worked with some people that were a little off. I've always tried to avoid any conflict with people like that. The media/police do tend to hide identity when its someone who isn't white, I wish that trend would stop. People of all kind commit crime.Yes, the media is just propaganda now.  It's hardly worth paying attention to.  There's lots more to be said about media in gernal but it's not really germane to this story.  If you were one of the victim's family members, would you rather not know the motivation for your father's killing?  Or would you rather find out it was something bad, like he was having a homosexual affiar or something disgusting?Its hard to media that just sticks to the facts, and the stuff relevant to the story. Plus stuff that is truly unbiased. I'm really not sure what I'd want to learn. I wouldn't want to learn that my father was involved in anything bad, but would at least want to know some of the motivation behind the attack.Yes, I think I agree with that.  Either way it's very sad for his family.  I wonder how the family of the murderer feels.

That usually means they're black.I've certainly worked with some people that were a little off. I've always tried to avoid any conflict with people like that. The media/police do tend to hide identity when its someone who isn't white, I wish that trend would stop. People of all kind commit crime.Yes, the media is just propaganda now.  It's hardly worth paying attention to.  There's lots more to be said about media in gernal but it's not really germane to this story.  If you were one of the victim's family members, would you rather not know the motivation for your father's killing?  Or would you rather find out it was something bad, like he was having a homosexual affiar or something disgusting?Its hard to media that just sticks to the facts, and the stuff relevant to the story. Plus stuff that is truly unbiased. I'm really not sure what I'd want to learn. I wouldn't want to learn that my father was involved in anything bad, but would at least want to know some of the motivation behind the attack.Yes, I think I agree with that.  Either way it's very sad for his family.  I wonder how the family of the murderer feels.  They must have mixed, strange emotions.If I was the family of the murdered I would feel really ashamed, unless somehow they felt going after Michael was warranted somehow. I guess it all depends, without the information its hard to make a full judgement.Yeah, I wouldn't be happen with what he did.  But he's also dead.  They also lost a loved one.  That's why I say it would be mixed emotions.Yeah. Well it looks like we are coming to our final messages. Its been good talking with you. I'm glad you feel the same way about the article.<s>Yes, thanks for chatting.  It's been good.</s>Yeah, thank you, so long.Goodbye. Take care.  I hope you don't experience anything like this story.

<s>hello</s>Hey, how's it going today?going well. and yourself?Good, did you read the article about the Southwest guy getting killed?Yeah my article was bout someone getting gunned down in oklahoma cityExactly, My first thoughts were "I wonder why the guy killed him". The article didn't give a reason.Yeah i just assumed they had to of known each other or something. seems a bit random, but i guess it happensAt first, because it was at an airport, I assumed it was a crazy passenger, but they said it was premeditated.Yeah its crazy how people will just blow up and choose to go this level of violence I don't get it either. Forget the fact that you are killing another person, but how can your life be so meaningless as well.

Forget the fact that you are killing another person, but how can your life be so meaningless as well.</s>exactly.  Makes me wonder what happened that was so bad that drove him to do that.

I felt bad for the people that live there. That's my first thought. I feel really bad for the people that live there and probably can't do anything about it to leave because it sounds like a real crappy place in my opinionI don't really understand what the war is about do you? from my understanding there were rebels that were given an ultimatum to lay down their arms and if not they were going to be killed it also said the article was from CNN so I don't take too much stock and anything that comes from there I read that to but that's not what the war is about.  I would like to find out. It doesn't say specifically but it mentions some things like when it referred to how Russia is there a major player with the president and government over there and how syria is trying to gain control over the city but I I don't understand completely myself honestly Either way I cannot not imagine having to live like that how about you I could not imagine living like that. I am very thankful to be an American and living in the United States. There is absolutely no way I would ever want to live in Syria with that type of stuff going on that's for sure. The article also talked about Isis and some things about the Kurds they talked about a lot of the groups over there  It's really quite crazy to think this is going on in our world right now as we chatyes i agree.

<s>Hello?</s>Hi there!Hi! So, how did you feel about the article?It left me a bit depressed and sad. How about you?Me too... I can't imagine what it'd be like to have to spend the final years of your life in a country with so much war.Right, I'm in the U.S. and some of this feel so removed even though it's really not.Me too. It's hard to imagine, but at the same time, I know it's real for some people...Definitely, it made me think about the circumstances under which I would even consider leaving my parents. Maybe if I had young kids or something, but I cannot get my head around it.Agreed. I don't think I could ever rest easily knowing that my parents lives are at risk like that.I guess the article also made me angry at how civilians get caught up in armed conflicts and are used by both/all sides.

Right, I'm in the U.S. and some of this feel so removed even though it's really not.Me too. It's hard to imagine, but at the same time, I know it's real for some people...Definitely, it made me think about the circumstances under which I would even consider leaving my parents. Maybe if I had young kids or something, but I cannot get my head around it.Agreed. I don't think I could ever rest easily knowing that my parents lives are at risk like that.I guess the article also made me angry at how civilians get caught up in armed conflicts and are used by both/all sides.I can agree with that. In war, it seems like civilians are seen simply as numbers, rather than human beings living real lives. It's hard to accept that some people are dehumanized in that way. We'd never accept such a thing happening in the U.S.Right, I know we try to "minimize" collateral damage but that it is inevitable in these situation. Still hard to comprehend.I wonder if there's another way. Does one really have to kill innocent people in order to make a point?Society would have to change a lot for us to get to that point but it does seem like there have to be better ways.<s>Yeah, it would take a lot of effort on both sides in order to get to that point, but I hope that some day, innocent people don't have to lose their lives over a fight they're not involved in...</s>In the article, I was curious that the one person remaining in Aleppo in the home he built had 10 children living with him. If he's that elderly, I thought they would be in their 40s or 50s which was odd.Huh, I never thought about it like that. I suppose so. Wouldn't they have children of their own at that point?That's what I was thinking, but just curious about it. I need to do some more specific research about Syria itself and the conflict there too.Yeah, hearing about it, it almost feels like they're living in an entirely different world. I wonder if it's standard for children to stay in the home for that long?I suspect in other cultures. I lived in a developing country and it was so different from the U.S., multiple generations in one home or next to each other. Grandparents took care of little kids while parents worked. People took care of grandparents, etc., no retirement, government assistance.Oh, did you? That's interesting. It seems like other countries are more collectivist - more oriented toward taking care of the family than toward individual success.Right, LOL....my parents have absolutely no desire to live with me or my sibling, so very different expectations.Lol, I would imagine that my parents would be the same, yes.

Huh, I never thought about it like that. I suppose so. Wouldn't they have children of their own at that point?That's what I was thinking, but just curious about it. I need to do some more specific research about Syria itself and the conflict there too.Yeah, hearing about it, it almost feels like they're living in an entirely different world. I wonder if it's standard for children to stay in the home for that long?I suspect in other cultures. I lived in a developing country and it was so different from the U.S., multiple generations in one home or next to each other. Grandparents took care of little kids while parents worked. People took care of grandparents, etc., no retirement, government assistance.Oh, did you? That's interesting. It seems like other countries are more collectivist - more oriented toward taking care of the family than toward individual success.Right, LOL....my parents have absolutely no desire to live with me or my sibling, so very different expectations.Lol, I would imagine that my parents would be the same, yes. Then again, it sounds like you're speaking about a situation in which families are nearly forced to live together, since there's no retirement or anything. Grandparents would be forced to live with their kids and be taken care of by them, or they wouldn't be able to pay for food or shelter.Right...although I imagine my parents would probably push me to leave with kids if the situation were like Aleppo even if I didn't want to do it.Yeah...

<s>Whatd you think of the article?</s>I thought it was interesting but I was curious to know how the polar bears' populations have changed during the time discussed.I agree, there wasn't much information given in that areaI'm also curious to see how polar bears adapt to their changing conditions.

That might involve infringing on human territory more often.  And at that point who knows what happens to them.  Because while polar bears are impressive, humans won't put up with them invading their spaces for too long.What would you think is the best option to fix it?It's way too complex a problem to suggest one simple solution.  I personally think that concerns for the polar bears should come way, way down on a list of priorities.  What do you think?Im not sure. Do you think this seasonal shift could snowball into a large problem?A large problem for whom?  I think this could certainly spell trouble for polar bears.  And that will have some effect on seal populations, and possibly human settlements in and around the arctic. But the issue with the polar bears, per se, I don't think resuls in some snowball of destruction.It is possible that polar bears population increase after a decrease
I'm also curious to see how polar bears adapt to their changing conditions.  Life doesn't usually just roll over and die.  It adapts and finds a way.  I'm curious how their behavior is changing.It is tough without the population data because they could be handling very wellYes, I suppose.  I'm not sure that's likely, but it's possible. They're big, impressive creatures.  But even they're weak compared to nature.I read more into the article being that of a expected time shift, something that happens every so often to the EarthIt's true that lots of things about earth change over time.  We tend to think of what we know of earth as how it's SUPPOSED to be.  But the reality is that polar bears have existed on earth for the blink of an eye compared to the time they haven't existed on earth, let alone in the universe.I'm hoping that is what is causing the shifts, tough problem to solve on a global scaleYes, it's a very difficult problem to solve.

And that will have some effect on seal populations, and possibly human settlements in and around the arctic.

Are more male polar bears eating more baby polar bears, for example, to make up for more difficult hunting conditions?

And I wonder how that changes their behavior, too.  For example, are they hibernating for shorter periods of time?  And how does all this affect pregnancies?  Lots of interesting questions.  It's like a labratory for studying how life adapts and changes in the face of changing environmental conditions.The behavior part is interesting. I imagine they may be more resourceful and skilledYes, you either adapt or die.  And species that have been around for thousands and thousands and thousands of years must be pretty adept at adapting or else they wouldn't still be here.Good point. They may need a new name if they adapt for warmer climatesYes, that's a funny point!  And they may evolve to have a different fur color too if they start heading south, away from the arctic, to find more food.

<s>Hello</s>hellow, how are you?Good, but that article was very sad.it was sad.Every time I read an article like that one, I wonder why more isn't being done.  It's like people don't realize the urgency of the situation.What should be done?As an example, instead of having all electric cars by 2050, let's do by 2030.is that feasible?Sure. If the government makes it a priority.yeah but it is so hard to get massive things like that done

Sure. If the government makes it a priority.yeah but it is so hard to get massive things like that doneI agree but we have no choice, in my opinion. What if climate change continues to get worse... then we have an even more massive thing to fix ... and it might be too late by then.if it continues to get worse, we are all in it togetherThat's true. I think there is too much focus on the economy and people are afraid to make changes because they're concerned that jobs will go away.  It's the exact opposite ... we'll create more jobs in the area of renewable energy.people hate changeThey do.  I even hate change sometimes.  But change is how we got to this place and change is needed to get us out.even people who are climate activists don't agree on what to do, that is what makes things so hardWell they might not agree on every detail, but they all agree that we're not doing enough and we're moving too slowly.<s>yea, it is hard to galvanize people though</s>I know.

<s>hello, did you read the article about the polar bears?</s>Hello. Yes I did. What were the emotions that you took from it and what was your first reaction regarding it?It was heartbreaking to hear that they are loosing the ability to survive. my first reaction was, If people need proof that global warming is happing, then read this article That's what I was going to ask you, what you thought the article was more geared towards. I couldn't tell if it was kind of both or was referring mostly to climate change or the polar bearsThats what i took from it, was about how global warming is causing the polar bears across the artic to have shorter winters etc. with them loosing about 7 weeks each year or so for the past 35 years. its about a 25% loss over the 35 years of study they done yeah 25% as a whole bunch in my opinion. That would mean in 140 years or less but it'll be gone? Am I doing the math correctly?I think that sounds about right. Wither the data presented was inflated or not. hard to say. There is defiantly a loss there for sure. that is tragic very sad where are the polar bears going to go if that happens?thats what I was thinking. I know they are on the endangered species list.  Sad reality is, people are too selfish. so more then likely they will all die out. besides the ones in captivity and the ones who live in Alaska etc.  Yes I was wondering if they were still on the endangered species list as well. I need to brush up on my geography that's for sure because I don't even know what is near there. I would have to Google it, it's been a long time

What were the emotions that you took from it and what was your first reaction regarding it?It was heartbreaking to hear that they are loosing the ability to survive. my first reaction was, If people need proof that global warming is happing, then read this article That's what I was going to ask you, what you thought the article was more geared towards. I couldn't tell if it was kind of both or was referring mostly to climate change or the polar bearsThats what i took from it, was about how global warming is causing the polar bears across the artic to have shorter winters etc. with them loosing about 7 weeks each year or so for the past 35 years. its about a 25% loss over the 35 years of study they done yeah 25% as a whole bunch in my opinion. That would mean in 140 years or less but it'll be gone? Am I doing the math correctly?<s>I think that sounds about right. Wither the data presented was inflated or not. hard to say. There is defiantly a loss there for sure. </s>that is tragic very sad where are the polar bears going to go if that happens?thats what I was thinking. I know they are on the endangered species list.  Sad reality is, people are too selfish. so more then likely they will all die out. besides the ones in captivity and the ones who live in Alaska etc.  Yes I was wondering if they were still on the endangered species list as well. I need to brush up on my geography that's for sure because I don't even know what is near there. I would have to Google it, it's been a long time I think what they were referring to was Antarctica. I think there are some small towns and such there. Inuit's mostly probably (guessing)  but as far as countries and what not. i think Africa is close?  Same for me. i need to brush up on locations etc. i know the general area lol. Same here lol I know the area but it's been so long since I was in school but I guess I should be more aware of things like this. But surely since the study was done that they can come up with a plan or are working on one to help the polar bears there's something awful like that does happen or continues to happen I should sayyeah totally. More then likely they just want to leave them alone and just store data. but as it dwindles down to the last few they will start protecting them in reserves and such im guessing as well lol I hope they wouldn't let them like starve to death or watch them die or something.. somebody's gotta do something about that.maybe they will start air dropping food in or something in remote locations where the tribes of the polar bears are. Might just scare them away thoughHey that's a really good idea airdropping food! Holy smokes that's like really incredible idea good  thinking!! I see your point too I doubt it might scare them away but hopefully it wouldn't because they would be hungry enough they would go to the food

I see your point too I doubt it might scare them away but hopefully it wouldn't because they would be hungry enough they would go to the food another downside i was thinking was if they did air drop food in, im wondering if they would just become reliant on that and tend to stay in the area where it was dropped expecting more to come etc. Thus causing them to not hunt at all. (could be a longshot of a thought) lol

Hopefully the researchers come up with something innovative if they can come up with AI which is absolutely incredible in my opinion they should surely be able to come up with something to help this circumstance.

On a side note. i think we still have a few more rounds of this to go before we submit lollol yes im at 9 right now i think... So if you were in charge of a research team and in the Arctic  dealing with this what would be the first thing that you do?

So if you were in charge of a research team and in the Arctic  dealing with this what would be the first thing that you do? I think its 30 total for both of us combined. which means 9 more after this message if thats the case.  If i were in charge? Hard to say without knowing all of the other data that they have found. We were only presented with a small amount for purposes of the article. I would say try to observe first then interact where you can.

That way they don't become human dependent and don't forget to learn how to hunt 
I think that sounds about right. Wither the data presented was inflated or not. hard to say. There is defiantly a loss there for sure. that is tragic very sad where are the polar bears going to go if that happens?thats what I was thinking. I know they are on the endangered species list.  Sad reality is, people are too selfish. so more then likely they will all die out. besides the ones in captivity and the ones who live in Alaska etc.  Yes I was wondering if they were still on the endangered species list as well. I need to brush up on my geography that's for sure because I don't even know what is near there. I would have to Google it, it's been a long time I think what they were referring to was Antarctica. I think there are some small towns and such there. Inuit's mostly probably (guessing)  but as far as countries and what not. i think Africa is close?  Same for me. i need to brush up on locations etc. i know the general area lol. Same here lol I know the area but it's been so long since I was in school but I guess I should be more aware of things like this. But surely since the study was done that they can come up with a plan or are working on one to help the polar bears there's something awful like that does happen or continues to happen I should sayyeah totally. More then likely they just want to leave them alone and just store data. but as it dwindles down to the last few they will start protecting them in reserves and such im guessing as well lol I hope they wouldn't let them like starve to death or watch them die or something.. somebody's gotta do something about that.maybe they will start air dropping food in or something in remote locations where the tribes of the polar bears are. Might just scare them away though<s>Hey that's a really good idea airdropping food! Holy smokes that's like really incredible idea good  thinking!! I see your point too I doubt it might scare them away but hopefully it wouldn't because they would be hungry enough they would go to the food </s>another downside i was thinking was if they did air drop food in, im wondering if they would just become reliant on that and tend to stay in the area where it was dropped expecting more to come etc. Thus causing them to not hunt at all. (could be a longshot of a thought) lol (i typed "I see your point too about it might scare away" my auto correct changed my word to the word "doubt" lol sorry) that's a another great point that you bring up about them becoming reliant and staying in the area. Hopefully the researchers come up with something innovative if they can come up with AI which is absolutely incredible in my opinion they should surely be able to come up with something to help this circumstance. Yeah i agree.  With their 35 years of data they have, they should be able to think of something. lol..... On a side note. i think we still have a few more rounds of this to go before we submit lollol yes im at 9 right now i think... So if you were in charge of a research team and in the Arctic  dealing with this what would be the first thing that you do? I think its 30 total for both of us combined. which means 9 more after this message if thats the case.  If i were in charge? Hard to say without knowing all of the other data that they have found. We were only presented with a small amount for purposes of the article. I would say try to observe first then interact where you can. Overall you want them to still be in their own environment and suchyes its 30 combined 15 each...

What is that called when animals that are wild become dependent on humans it's not like being team but there's another name for it and I cannot think of what it's called it's right on the tip of my tongue i think i know what your talking about. lol now i cant think of the name either lol that's gonna drive me crazy til i remember lol. It'll be one of those things that come to me at 3 o'clock in the morning when I'm not thinking about it lol haha i know that feeling. might be something i have to end up googling. lolme too haha you sound just like me lol
Hey that's a really good idea airdropping food! Holy smokes that's like really incredible idea good  thinking!! I see your point too I doubt it might scare them away but hopefully it wouldn't because they would be hungry enough they would go to the food another downside i was thinking was if they did air drop food in, im wondering if they would just become reliant on that and tend to stay in the area where it was dropped expecting more to come etc. Thus causing them to not hunt at all. (could be a longshot of a thought) lol (i typed "I see your point too about it might scare away" my auto correct changed my word to the word "doubt" lol sorry) that's a another great point that you bring up about them becoming reliant and staying in the area. Hopefully the researchers come up with something innovative if they can come up with AI which is absolutely incredible in my opinion they should surely be able to come up with something to help this circumstance. Yeah i agree.  With their 35 years of data they have, they should be able to think of something. lol..... On a side note. i think we still have a few more rounds of this to go before we submit lollol yes im at 9 right now i think... So if you were in charge of a research team and in the Arctic  dealing with this what would be the first thing that you do? I think its 30 total for both of us combined. which means 9 more after this message if thats the case.  If i were in charge? Hard to say without knowing all of the other data that they have found. We were only presented with a small amount for purposes of the article. I would say try to observe first then interact where you can. Overall you want them to still be in their own environment and suchyes its 30 combined 15 each...

<s>Hello</s>Howdy!Were you aware of what was happening to the polar bear population prior to reading this?I had known that ice was melting in the polar regions, but I hadn't really thought about how much it might impact polar bears and other animals. What about you?Same, I guess I hadn't focused too much on the polar bear population. It's sad to think this is happening.Yeah, it is not fun to think that we might be causing issues for the polar bears. It was a bit of an eye opener to make me think about it like that.Do you believe climate change is occurring and caused by humans?Yeah, I definitely believe that climate change is happening and is primarily caused by humans. I think it's awful how much we are abusing the planet. That's just my feelings on it though.I agree, hard to imagine how anyone wouldn't believe that with all of the research that has been done.You would think, but lots of people still don't believe it! Maybe if they read the article about the polar bears or saw videos of it they might change their mind.

I'll turn lights off when I'm not using them, I keep my home cool in winter, warmer in summer. Things like that.</s>I do those things as well. I recently bought a hybrid vehicle as I am not quite sold on full electric yet but I feel good about that.Nice! That's definitely a good and large step to take. Hybrids definitely are better for the environment than non-hybrids. The polar bears would thank you :)I agree, I am also hoping to get solar panels installed at some pointThat would be good, and could also pay for themselves in the long run. They can make a big impact on reducing your electric bill.My electric bills were astronomical this last winter. I hope to offset a lot of that through solar. Smart thinking. Also I should have asked earlier to make sure we got the same article. Was yours about how ice was melting more and the data associated with the research? Yes, that is corect, same articleJust checking lol. I was a bit surprised by some of the numbers in it such as how many weeks of "good ice" time the polar bears get now.I agree, that was surprising. Do you think we will be able to stop or reverse global warming?
I had known that ice was melting in the polar regions, but I hadn't really thought about how much it might impact polar bears and other animals. What about you?Same, I guess I hadn't focused too much on the polar bear population. It's sad to think this is happening.Yeah, it is not fun to think that we might be causing issues for the polar bears. It was a bit of an eye opener to make me think about it like that.Do you believe climate change is occurring and caused by humans?Yeah, I definitely believe that climate change is happening and is primarily caused by humans. I think it's awful how much we are abusing the planet.

Yes, that is corect, same articleJust checking lol. I was a bit surprised by some of the numbers in it such as how many weeks of "good ice" time the polar bears get now.I agree, that was surprising. Do you think we will be able to stop or reverse global warming?I sure hope so, but I'm not sure. It seems like it might already be too late, but scientific advances are always surprising me. Also as it gets harder and harder to deny it, more money will get invested in research.I hope so as well. I get a bit nervous for my kids and society's future when I think about the lasting impacts.Hopefully the future will be better for your kids! Using those polar bears and other cute animals might be a good way to get people to pay more attention. It's hard to say no to cute animals.Great point, I hope that is a selling point for others! I just can't understand why some people chose to disregard the issue.

<s>Hi, are you there?</s>Yes, what did you think of the article?It's bad and unfairI agree.

It seems to me that if a person has spent their entire life here and acted like a citizen, then they should be treated like one. That's what I think. I thought people get their citizenship after 15 years of staying here anyway.No, apparently not. We seem to just be looking for reasons to deport people, even using the smallest technicalities. We have deported people who served in the military when it turned out that they weren't really citizens.What?! That is crazy!Sure, dreamers who have been here nearly their entire lives who wanted to serve their country. Sad and ridiculous.They shouldn't have been deported. I'm a little appalled at that. How can someone fight for the country just to be deported later? America needs to make some changes.
Yes, what did you think of the article?It's bad and unfairI agree. Sometimes I think we do things like that because we want to feel that we are better than others.It was most perplexing that they didn't even sign the boy up for his citizenship, as if they already knew that they wanted to mistreat him.Yes, I felt that that was a part of the abuse.

I wonder what makes some people aware and while others are not.I think that people get in echo chambers with others who feel the same way they do, and they convince each other that they are right and the rest of the world is wrong. It would be funny if it didn't hurt others so much..Oh, yeah. And if no physical person is there, they can go online where there is bound to be some people who agrees with them.YouTube too. One of my friends got me to look at a video about 9/11. For the next month everything I got in my feed was a conspiracy theory, one crazier than the other. No wonder people are scared.Oh, those conspiracy theories are very weird! On was about the moon landing being faked. I like astronomy and they had my curiosity piqued.The scary thing is that the more facts you give them that show they are wrong, the more convinced they are that they are right.
Yeah, I live in Texas and have seen similar things happen quite a bit. It seems to me that if a person has spent their entire life here and acted like a citizen, then they should be treated like one. That's what I think. I thought people get their citizenship after 15 years of staying here anyway.No, apparently not. We seem to just be looking for reasons to deport people, even using the smallest technicalities. We have deported people who served in the military when it turned out that they weren't really citizens.What?! That is crazy!Sure, dreamers who have been here nearly their entire lives who wanted to serve their country. Sad and ridiculous.They shouldn't have been deported. I'm a little appalled at that. How can someone fight for the country just to be deported later? America needs to make some changes.The problem is that the changes we have made are designed to hurt people. When I read about the man in the article all I saw was us punishing someone who was trying to do the right thing. The thing is that most of the people around here are all for that sort of behavior.I wouldn't be surprised. Many people in America are oppressors. Even some of the oppressed go on to oppress people who are more vulnerable than them. I feel sad for them going through such things.Yeah, it seems like a lot of us need someone to hate.<s>That type of personality is so lazy - taking the easy way out. The regrets later are going to hit them like a ton of bricks.</s>Maybe, but a lot of them are so convinced that they are right that I doubt their conscious will ever bother them.

<s>Hi</s>HeyHow are you doing?I'm pretty good. How about you?Not bad.   So, what did you think about the article on Adam Crapser?   I feel very sympathetic for him as I don't believe that he is responsible for his situation.It's horrible. I feel like an exception should be made in his case. It wasn't his fault.There were obvious mistakes made during the adoption process when he was a child.  He should not be punished for those mistakes.No, he shouldn't. And to make matters worse, his family is going to suffer.I agree.   Deporting him rips his family apart and causes everyone to suffer.And all for what was essentially a paperwork error. Given the life he lived up to that point with the abuse he suffered, it's hard to not feel sorry for him.

I don't think a lot of changes were made until issues were identified starting in the 1980s.It's probably still broken. I hope no other family has to go through this. Just no excuse for it. Hopefully Crapser found a way to get back to his family.I just feel sad and angry that we, as a nation, allowed his situation to get to that point.People don't pay too much attention to issues, which is the problem. If it doesn't affect them personally, they don't care.
How are you doing?I'm pretty good. How about you?Not bad.   So, what did you think about the article on Adam Crapser?   I feel very sympathetic for him as I don't believe that he is responsible for his situation.It's horrible. I feel like an exception should be made in his case. It wasn't his fault.There were obvious mistakes made during the adoption process when he was a child.  He should not be punished for those mistakes.No, he shouldn't. And to make matters worse, his family is going to suffer.I agree.   Deporting him rips his family apart and causes everyone to suffer.And all for what was essentially a paperwork error. Given the life he lived up to that point with the abuse he suffered, it's hard to not feel sorry for him.This case was a few years ago.  Do you know what eventually transpired?<s>Supposedly there was a bill that was being debated in Congress. I don't know if it passed, but I think it might've been too late for Crapser anyway. </s>Yeah.  Looks that way.  I think that he was eventually deported.

I hope he's doing better these days.I hope that someone read about his case and was willing to support him and his family financially or to even relocate them to a third country.   Canada has always seemed very open to refugees?Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. Maybe someone could start a crowdfund for him.
I believe that there were a lot of "hidden" issues in the adoption system back in the 40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s.   I don't think a lot of changes were made until issues were identified starting in the 1980s.It's probably still broken. I hope no other family has to go through this. Just no excuse for it. Hopefully Crapser found a way to get back to his family.I just feel sad and angry that we, as a nation, allowed his situation to get to that point.People don't pay too much attention to issues, which is the problem. If it doesn't affect them personally, they don't care.I just wish that a politician in his state had championed his situation and tried to prevent the deportation.Yeah, they probably could've gotten a lot of advertising and fundraising out of it. It would've been a win-win.Also, most of this transpired during the Obama administration.   The Trump administration became even more hardline on deportations.I think some deportations should have exemptions made for them. A lot shouldn't be eligible like unauthorized border-crossings, but this was a unique situation.The other sad fact is that Adam was deported to South Korea but he has no idea how to speak Korean.<s>That's horrible.

<s>Hi</s>Hi, how are you?Good, thanksSo have you done some of these HITs before, I think they have been going on for about 1.5 weeksI recall doing one before. Have you done one? yes, what I don't like is that there is no time frame to the article to know how old the information isYes, a frame of time would be useful. However, I think even without that information we could still discuss the article. Have you read it already?yes, the whole Afghanistan war helping then withdrawing an not much progress is concerningYes, there was a quick withdrawal. The article cites the withdrawal of combat troops around 2014. It doesn't seem like it has been that long already which was surprising to me.I agree it felt like it was more recent.  Of course it has been a long ongoing war, maybe the Nato forces withdrew earlier and the US stayed longer.

I bet you that they would quickly find the person at fault if higher ups were held to be accountable.Apparently it was a very big attack: On 3 October 2015, a United States Air Force AC-130U gunship attacked the Kunduz Trauma Centre operated by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF, or Doctors Without Borders) in the city of Kunduz, in the province of the same name in northern Afghanistan.[3][4][5][6][7][8] 42 people were killed[2] and over 30 were injured. Médecins Sans Frontières condemned the incident, calling it a deliberate breach of international humanitarian law and a war crime. It further stated that all warring parties had been notified about the hospital and its operations well in advanceYes, that is an unacceptable number of civilian casualties. Even one is too much, but this level of destruction and death is intolerable. It is difficult not to agree with the statements from Doctors Without Borders.
yes, what I don't like is that there is no time frame to the article to know how old the information isYes, a frame of time would be useful.

Of course it has been a long ongoing war, maybe the Nato forces withdrew earlier and the US stayed longer.You are correct, this is specifically pertaining to NATO. Still, I feel that NATO and the US left very quickly. What was your first reaction about the article?Anytime there is death of families not soldiers is concerning and friendly fire is the saddest as well, you think how could this be prevented That's how I felt immediately too.

<s>Hai</s>Hi, what did you think about the incident?

There are people who think we should be actively engaged in these problems, and people who think we should just ignore them, that they aren' our country's problem.  One can always vote for the person they think will push for their vision of America's invovlement of these things.  I just want us to keep destroying terrorism, wherever it is.

Yes, although I would say that it's unreasonable to think that people can, or should, take seriously and personally every piece of news they come across.  We're exposed to too much news nowadays.

I am not sure what else can come out of reading an article like this. JOYY??!Haha, exactly! Yay tragedy!I secretly wish that the US would pull out of the middle east and stop whatever they have been doing there for decades thoughI agree completely! What a waste of livesabsolutely, and a waste of taxpayer money as wellThat too! I feel like so many of the younger people that end up in the military are being dupedand get all these PTSD or whatever side effects that come with it<s>Absolutely, well I think we are about done nice chatting with you</s>

So do you have any thoughts on the article about the immigrants dying?I read the article and it is tragic, how people can lose their lives searching for something so SAVE their very lifeI agree. It really put it into perspective when they compared the figures to the chances of being killed in the US by guns.yes,  also it seems that when tragedies like these happen, people tend to blame the vicmisThat's true, If I was in their position, I'd take the same risks they are taking.for sure,  do you think elected officials care about immigrant's well-being here and/or abroad?I think they do, but they also realize that it's an expensive problem, an unpopular problem and a problem with no easy answers.
