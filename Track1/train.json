            "Apparently. The most worrisome part of the situation is the fact that they barely compensate the victims",
            "It's such a shame and a human rights abuse. Every living creature for that matter has a basic right to clean air and water. I couldn't imagine how bad it must be living near one of those mines.",

            "Any change with government happens when people join together en mass. They need to be protesting outside of every politicians office. They should also spread this story to the international community to publicly shame their officials. Do you have any ideas of what can be done?",
            "In all honesty, I have no idea.",
            "I can think of how in the US change was created with the civil rights movement, and the women's movement when people stood together. I think that because people like us know about the story we can help by sharing this information on social media. We can be the media for them. But what can be done about the poor elephants? They have lost their homes because of the forest's being destroyed.",
            "It's left for their government to decide",
            "Ultimately yes. So it's up to everyone to make sure their government works in their best interest. Some people not even receiving compensation was terrible, but what about the kids who lost their lives? No amount of money can replace life.",
            "True. It's really pathetic",
            "There should be some sort of a program that helps these elephants get transported to a place where their homes won't be destroyed. Do you know of any charities that could help?",
            "Nope. I doubt if the government will allow that.",

            "I've read series of disturbing stories about their activities in the illegal trade of ivory",

            "Yeah. It's all about the rupees",

            "That's the reality.",
            "At the very least I wonder if we could donate things like breathing masks? Maybe that could help some to breath a bit better. Or if there is a way to get them clean water delivered.",
            "That won't be a bad idea. How do \"we\" go about that",

            "There have been several scam cases with GFM",

            "That'll be great",

            "I wonder if the animals are having lung issues too?",
            "I wouldn't be surprised; many animals have similar lung structures as humans do. It's probably why the elephants etc. have been in so many altercations lately.",

            "I was not really bothered, suicides are common",
            "common?  I guess.  I don't really see it as an everyday occurence but anyhow",
            "No not everyday but people do it and that is their choice",
            "Yep, it is definitely their choice.  I still find it sad and very avoidable.  How sad for all their remaining family members.",
            "I see what you mean but don't you think that being sad is just a waste of time?",
            "Of course being sad is a waste of time, but it is still appropriate to feel sadness when you hear of a tragedy.  It's not like I'm dressed in black lighting candles and mourning, Jesus Christ.",
            "Easy now. I did not mean it as a personal attack. It just doesn't make sense to me to be sad for someone who makes a conscious choice to end their own life. It's their choice",
            "Well then be neutral towards it or happy, that's your right.  I find it sad anytime I hear about a tragedy that happens to others.  I am sad for their family who lost a beloved family member.",
            "Let me be clear, I would rather no one commit suicide. How do we know that they were beloved? They could have despised each other",
            "Sure they could have, but surely there was at least one person who appreciated this woman.  The article stated as much.",
            "A fair point. When you think about it suicide is the easy way out. It is a bit cowardly. Choosing to continue living requires real courage",
            "I agree suicide is extremely cowardly and suicide angers me.  It is a terrible choice for people to make and very selfish bc they are not considering how their actions affect others who are left behind.",
            "We can agree on that. Do you know anyone personally who committed suicide?",
            "Yes, and dealing with the fallout from it and the years and years of aftermath from that person's loved ones was terrible and very straining on everyone around.  The loved ones are STILL not healed and it has been 13 years",
            "I got that impression from your responses. Do you think the loved ones deserve treatment or should preventative measures be the answer to suicide?",
            "Can you clarify your question?  I am not sure I fully understand.  Do you mean grief counseling, or what preventative measures are you referring to?  Like should more have been done to try to help the person to start with?",
            "Hospitalization, medication, psychotherapy, or even depriving someone of their freedom temporarily to ensure they do not take their life",
            "I think those are reasonable steps to take in some cases but in others it might just make things worse.  I really don't know the answer to that.  If someone is that determined to take their own life it seems they will do it no matter what.  What do you think?  I don't think any of that stuff would have helped int he situation I'm referring to.  But who knows.",
            "What do you think causes suicide? Most animals have such a strong will to live. What causes people to abandon or ignore that innate drive?",
            "That's an interesting point about animals.  We don't see them giving up and killing themselves.  Fascinating question, I have no idea what it is about humans.  Maybe it has just become a part of our culture?  Like if the first animal did it then others would follow?  No clues.  What do you think",
            "I am not sure myself. Most animals also do not have complex social structures and constructs like humans. I am sure that with those stark differences it would be good place to start the investigation.",
            "Yes I wonder if it has ever been formally studied",
            "I was wondering that myself. I think the best animals to study would be primates. I know chimpanzees can suffer from depression but I am not sure whether or not they commit suicide",
            "OH yeah, really good point.  That would be very interesting to find out.  I guess it would be possible that they could because they do a lot of things that we do.",
            "True, but they also don't do a lot of things we do and I am not sure whether or not suicide is in the Do or Don't category.",
            "yeah exactly.  It is probably in the don't category.  I guess I could see them like refusing to eat or drink more than bringing a knife to their wrist.",
            "Refusing food and sexual gratification are some of the things chimpanzees do when they are depressed. Similar symptoms in humans. If they were to commit suicide how do you think they would go about doing it?",
            "I would think it would be passive, such as just refusing food and drink until they can't survive.  But maybe the urge to survive would override their depression?  Hard to say.  This has been an interesting conversation and I think we are at 15 messages so I will say goodbye for now and hope you have a great day",

            "It made me very sad.   She had such a hard life.   Whether it's socialized medicine or medicine here in the states, they miss so much with mental illness.",
            "I agree. I feel like we are not doing enough about mental illness as a society",
            "We aren't.   I am so tired of physicians sending you to a therapist to talk about your childhood or given medicine that doesn't work.   No one listens to the patient at all.",
            "Exactly! It's very rare you find a good therapist. Most of them just can't wait to get home.",
            "Yes!   I have suffered from dark depression my entire life.   It has nothing to do with your childhood.   You were wired that way at birth.   To date, physicians are just initially tapping how to help people.    Such a long way to go.",
            "It must have been really tough for you. I think i have mild depression and it's such a struggle.",
            "Oh it is.   Your family doesn't know how to help.   I just stay exhausted and really never socialize.   It really has nothing for therapists to address.   They can help victims of assault, etc. but they do not help for depression.   At least, that's been the case for me.    I'm sorry you suffer from it.",
            "Yeah it's terrible. I have anxiety as well and everyday is a struggle to be honest",
            "Just know I totally understand.   From personal experience, I think anxiety and depression go hand and hand.   I have a lot of anxiety around people or social settings.   What about you?",
            "I am the same. I even have trouble going out with close friends sometimes. Just being around people, i don't like..",
            "Yeah me too.   I looked at this article and remember this being in the news.   She did all the \"right\" things, physicians didn't share nor did they do anything with the statement of suicide.   That's unacceptable.",
            "Yeah i still feel bad for the person in the article. Do you think people in society now are more accepting of mental illnesses?",
            "No - they just look at you with that pitiful look and once employers know they look for ways to terminate you - if you had cancer everyone is supportive.",
            "That's an interesting way to look at it but i agree. I honestly don't think society will EVER be accepting of people with mental illnesses. They'll always think of us as the \"crazy\" ones.",
            "And your point is exactly why none of us want to convey we have it.   To your point, we are all crazy.",
            "Well at least we all know deep down we're great people and just slightly different which makes us special.",
            "We are - the thing we have to come to agreement on is how do we not feel like we can't do anything all the time.   I don't ever get a break from those feelings.",
            "I get those feelings as well but i think we should tell ourselves that it's okay to have these feelings from time to time. But anyway, that's it for our convo, hope you have a great life and things improve! bye",

Too much destruction to risk going to war, so we fought proxy battles and use diplomacy and sanctions and things like that more than hot wars.  But of course one leader could change that.",

            "I was kind of concerned when it started talking about zoo owners being fined or punished. It's not really *their* fault.",
            "That's an excellent point. The owners can't change the situation, that isn't fair at all. It isn't as if they want their animals to be sick/die!",
            "I thought that embalming/preserving some of the animals was a valid idea, for science, but only if absolutely necessary and only if they were euthanized humanely.",
            "Agreed - I would imagine that would provide a more humane death than starvation/malnutrition. Do you consider yourself to be an animal lover?",

            "What's his temperament like?",
            "Well, I adopted him at 3.5, so I can't testify what is breed standard and what was due to his previous owner/occupation. He was a military family's dog who \"worked\" on base, and he accompanied them to work. But he's wonderful. Very calm, emotionally sensitive. Great with kids. Not any of the agression or hyperactivity you hear about the breed.",
            "Sounds wonderful - and sounds like you lucked out! Did you adopt him through a special service?",
            "No, our local animal shelter, actually. The family was being relocated overseas and the base in the other location didn't allow dogs. They released him to the shelter so that his new home would be checked out and verified safe beforehand. We did luck out!",
            "That's even better. I ask because I have friends who adopted a dog that was being trained as a mobility assistant - but he failed the final test after pulling someone out of a wheelchair to chase a rabbit. :)",
            "hahah! those rabbits are tricky!",
            "Right? And irresistable!",
            "I'm surprised the dog got to the final test, but I guess it's a good thing a rabbit came by",

            "Do you have pets yourself? And did your degree focus on specific species?",
            "I do - I'm not sure what happened, but I have cats ... 5 cats. It's a bit terrifying. And, yes, thanks for asking! I'm technically a \"primatologist\" - I ran around watching monkeys",
            "interesting! I almost went into equine studies. instead I got my AKC training certificate and an elementary education degree lol",
            "Nice! I work with some folks doing applied animal behavior with dogs. Cool stuff. And I teach at community college, so I'm right there with you! :)",

            "I don't know. Zoos are already kinda questionable ethically, but I for sure think you shouldn't have one if you can't take care of it. It seems like the animals should be moved elsewhere.",
            "Yeah I had the exact same thought.  Although what to do with all the animals?  If they just released them suely they would die or be slaughtered",
            "I assume they'd have to be moved somewhere else, maybe another country's zoo or wildlife center until they can be put somewhere permanently?",
            "Yes I thought that too, but who would pay for the move, and who would coordinate it all?",
            "It'd have to be another organization, I think the article mentioned a couple -- IFAW and Four Paws or something? But getting the governments to agree would be tricky.",

            "Yeah. It's sad how it seems to be going on in a lot of countries. :(",

            "I feel sorry for the polar bears. I wonder what behavioral changes biologists are noticing in their behavior.  Certainly the bears will change something to try to survive, although the Arctic doesn't give them too many options, probably.",

            "I wonder if we can even do anything about it?  Even if we decrease CO2 production, their environment might continue to melt away.",
            "I don't know, I'm not qualified to answer that - I just hope something can be done for them",
            "They're definitely majestic animals.  It seems ironic that something that's so big and powerful can seem so impotent in the face of the vicissitudes of mother nature.",
            "I agree. I want them to be around for a long time",
            "Still, we tend to think that the world is supposed to be the way we know it now.  We, like polar bears, have only existed for the tiniest fraction of the earth's and universe's history.  And yet we thing it's anomalous for us to not be here.",
            "I agree. I don't wish for any creature to suffer or go extinct",

            "maybe. but now most car manufacturers are making electric vehicles, so in the near future there will be less of a need for gas",
            "Agree, but apparently there are much larger problems than just cars.  Apparently the concrete industry is like the single-worst thing, and nobody talks about that at all.",
            "there are also problems like pollution, especially in India and china",
            "Yes, those countries are terrible.  We worry over here about plastic straws and stuff like that, but that stuff is totally irrelevant.",

            "That's pretty horrific.",

            "I think that we need to take a more active approach in the control of the climate. We need to stop treating it as something supernal because humans can obviously bend it to their own selfish wills. Such as, dumping iron oxide into the ocean to create super massive blooms of plankton. This will not only effectively remove significant amounts of carbon from the atmosphere, but sequester it in living things that will thrive off of the nutrition; passing that down the line and enriching our depleted oceans.",

            "I think making use of energy saving bulbs, not throwing dirt anywhere just do something to help conserve the energy more and help the climate",
            "I agree that making more environmental choices in the home will help people adjust for a low energy future, but even at scale those kinds of actions won't do anything to prevent the acceleration of climate change. It's nice for an American to do these paltry things and go to bed at night with a sense of satisfaction, but the events that have been set in motion will have dire consequences for those less fortunate.",
            "oh wow. I just really feel sad for the bears really",
            "That's why they're used as a poster child for something much larger. Polar bears are cute and fluffy and easy to feel compassion for from a great distance. Humans being cooked to death and dying from thirst isn't as cuddly.",

            "yeah that does not make sense to me.  why on earth",
            "It may have to do with competition from mammoth ivory in Russia",
            "you clearly know more about this than me, but yeah I guess that would make sense.",
            "Do you think it makes sense to have some elephants listed as appendix 1 animals and others not?",
            "I don't know enough about it to say.  Elephants from certain countries were appendix 1 and others were appendix 2, correct?  what do you think?",
            "As it was stated in the article elephants don't have passports. It doesn't make sense for them to have different protections on different sides of a border. This would just create ''arbitrage'' opportunities that poachers would no doubt exploit",
            "Yeah I agree.  All they have to do is walk across an imaginary line and they suddenly have a different level of protection.  That does not make logical sense.",
            "I wonder if Africa's development and modernization are correlated with poaching at all. I would like to believe this would decrease poaching as an industry",
            "I would like to think that too, but I would imagine there is a very long way to go before there is a big difference",
            "What makes you say that?",
            "I don't see poaching decreasing or disappearing dramatically overnight.  I think it would take a long period of time and be a gradual change",
            "Kenya just recently instituted the death penalty for poachers. What do you think would be some good ways to discourage poaching?",
            "That sounds sufficient.  Like I said, I know nothing about this topic so it is great that you are educating me.",
            "I don't know much myself. I don't support the death penalty generally and in this case I don't see how it would help. Poachers will move further south and increase their activities in other parts of the continent. I think on balance this will just lead to more poaching",
            "I guess you would have to see if the amount of poaching actually decreases in response to the death penalty.  It would depend on how it were enforced.",
            "I think that is the biggest problem that conservation efforts in Africa face. Enforcement. If the African nations even agree on what measures to take, they almost never enforce them rigorously.",
            "Exactly, and then there is corruption in the government as well so that would be an issue.",
            "Do you think the international community has a duty to intervene at this point?",

            "The idea that we are still allowing so many endangered animals to be killed and especially an animal as gentle and amazing as an elephant is just heartbreaking. I feel so frustrated, angry and helpless over this situation. I do think it is time to crack down on those buying the ivory as strongly as those poaching.",
            "It really is ridiculous. But what more can be done? It's been banned in multiple countries. I've even heard of groups of people who arm themselves and go out to personally stop poachers, and yet it still continues. I'm not sure what else could be done to stop this from happening.",
            "There is no obvious simple solution and I think that is part of the problem. I think it's hindered by so many African countries that are poor and the amount of money made on the blackmarket for ivory just makes it difficult to stop.",
            "I think you are right about cracking down on the buyers. Maybe trying to stop the poachers is a losing effort, but going after the buyers may have an impact. But these criminal blackmarkets are probably very difficult to shut down.",
            "Oh yes, that is nearly as difficult as the poachers I'm sure. But even beyond the buyers, those that are buying ivory items and maybe not realizing what that means is a big factor I think. If we educate more people about what having an ivory figurine means, perhaps that can be a start as well.",
            "I'm sure that would go a long way. It's at least something that could be done that may have an impact. As we've seen from the drug trade, stopping illegal items from being sold is almost impossible. I'm sure there's levels of corruption involved as well. There's so much money to be made I bet a lot of these officials are cashing in and turning a blind eye as well.",
            "Oh exactly, it always comes down to the money. Stop them being able to make a profit and perhaps we can stop the senseless killing.",
            "And when it's the officials who are getting paid, the ones who are supposed to be stopping this, it makes it that much harder.",
            "Yes corruption I'm sure is very huge. It has to take everyone being on the same page to make a difference. As the article stated having each country giving elephants different levels of protection shows that no one is seeing this issue in the same way.",
            "I think if the west took more of an interest in this things could get done. Poaching still a problem? Cut the aid given to the country. If they make it a priority things will change.",
            "I do think the west will have to step in. Unfortunately, it takes a major outrage before we seem to be able to get all the west willing to do more.",
            "You're right. Not to mention with all the political nonsense going on right now, I think people are being overwhelmed with problems and issues and just kind of ignore it all.",
            "Well it's so easy to ignore it now. We don't like something on social media, we can just ignore those posting about it. Something has to be done to make it not so easy to ignore.",
            "Yeah, I also think it's because people don't know what to trust anymore. Can we really say the news sources are trustworthy? Officials are lying, news commentators are biased, social media is full of nonsense, who wants to deal with that?",
            "So very true. Who do we even believe anymore? Where can we turn to get information that we can believe in.",
            "That's the question. The news media seems more like propaganda to me these days. Almost like school children hurling insults back and forth. So something like the illegal ivory trade would definitely get pushed to the bottom of the news worthy list.",
            "I totally agree. It seems news media are more like the old tabloids going for shock value and trying to get the most following and not worried about real news issues and trying to educate the people. Things going on in Africa are so far away, it's easy to let those kinds of issues slide in favor of the latest scandal to get ratings.",
            "Yeah. I think awareness is key. Increase awareness and maybe it will effect change. I mean, I wasn't aware poaching was this bad of a problem until reading this article.",
            "Awareness, education and meaningful discussions of what the loss elephants can mean to the world are definitely a key.",
            "With all the problems occurring worldwide I don't have much faith in anything stopping poaching honestly.",
            "Unfortunately, I think I have to agree. Unless the poaching starts having an impact on our daily lives, I fear most will simply ignore it as something that doesn't matter.",
            "Yeah, it really is unfortunate. Those elephants don't deserve that, and I'm sure it's frustrating to the rangers trying to stop it. People just don't care anymore unless it's right smack dab in their face.",
            "Definitely. And the rangers that are putting their lives on the line to try and make a difference aren't being respected either.",
            "Yeah I remember the article said those rangers were being shot at on sight by the poachers. That's madness. Seems like it would be taken more seriously if it's that dangerous out there.",
            "I fear that it's so \"wild\" as the animals need it that it's hard to take care of the rangers anymore than the animals. But I agree, rangers just being shot at for doing their jobs is another outrage.",
            "Yeah, I'm sure funding is an issue as well. Hiring more rangers, or even bringing in some kind of military presence probably isn't an option.",
            "Seems issues always boil down to the same things. More money needed. More education needed. More knowledge. More awareness.",
            "Yeah, and when those things are lacking, everything just gets worse and worse.",
            "I have to agree. I hope that by raising our own awarness with conversations like these we can start seeing some change. I've enjoyed this conversation and want to thank you for sharing your thoughts and ideas. I've enjoyed our talk, goodbye.",
            "I enjoyed it as well, goodbye."

            "Interesting, I hadn't thought of that! In what ways do you think they would be different?",
            "It would make sense that a smaller person would have different thresholds that they can handle",
            "Right. That makes sense. Switching gears: what do you think of the officials being unable to assign fault for the death? Wasn't the reason clear?",
            "Probably just trying to avoid having to punish somebody for this. I think the reason of death is clear just not who caused it.",
            "The whole thing is sad. I wonder what protocol changes will be made (if any) because of it",
            "I'm not sure which protocols would need to be changed. Maybe the distance that planes can be close to one another?",
            "That seems like a good place to start",
            "Do you think this hurts the chances of more women becoming pilots?",
            "I hadn't thought of that. Maybe? I don't think it would keep women from wanting to become pilots - flying is always risky - but I wonder if public opinion will turn against women flying. What do you think?",
            "I think this may deter women from becoming pilots if special measures are not taken to protect them.",
            "I wonder if anything like this has happened to male pilots in China? Would that story be a big deal like this one?",
            "Probably not. It's not that big of a story if a male dies doing this. Just the way it is.",
            "In China or in general?",
            "In general I guess. It's the norm for male soldiers to die but women get the publicity as it is more rare.",
            "That's probably true, although I think the way that it happened would get press if it happened in the US. Such a freak occurrance",
            "True. Would the male be made out to be a hero though?",
            "I would actually say yes, but I bet there would be more press/sympathy if it was a woman",
            "Heh. Maybe true equality will come one day. I'm about out of thoughts on this article though!",
            "LOL, me too. We've hit 15, so - have a nice day! bye",

            "That is the truth! Where are the parents - not just of the kids being bullied, but of othe bullies themselves?f the",
            "Parents are just not being parents from the looks of things",
            "Sorry about that typo. Why do you think parents don't seem to be willing to be more engaged in their kids' lives? Are the adults too busy, they don't want to intrude, they just want to be buddies with their kids...",
            "I think life keeps adults too busy to keep the food on the table to be honest...",
            "I'm sure that's a big part of it. Maybe parents don't know how to deal with the online/social media world, either",
            "What do you think the kids that cause the bullying should face?",
            "That's a great question. There should be some form of punishment but that must include some empathy training. What do you think?",
            "I believe that is something they should do train them to do better since kids aren't really ready to think straight yet as I did some things I regret as a kid as well that I would no longer do as an adult.",
            "There should probably be school-wide programs to try to prevent all this in the first place. I wonder how clearly this issue is being addressed in US schools?",
            "I don't think its being addressed here at all although who knows. The article says in France 90 percent of the kids have access to social media which is where all the bullying goes on. Can you imagine how many kids have access here .",
            "It's scary to consider! Must be closer to 100% here.  I'm old enough that there was no social media when I was in school and I'm so freaking grateful for that!",
            "Yeah the worst that can happen back then was miniscule to now where hundreds of kids can bully a single child at one time through social media.",
            "Exactly. It would be scary as hell to be in school these days. Funny, I always think of this as a US problem, but I shouldn't be surprised that it's a major issue in Europe, too",
            "yeah I assume every country with wide internet access has this problem.",
            "Hooray for technology!",
            "What would you do if one of your kids were bullied?",
            "You know, I'm not sure. I'm not a parent; beyond being furious, I want to say that I would get in touch with school officials and try to get all the parents involved.  I would give my kid the option to change schools or maybe be homeschooled....? What about you?",
            "Same first thing is contact the other kids parents to see if they can talk to the other kid as I would not be able to do that. Second definitely contact the school and if all else fails the police but they would be my last resort. I'm not a parent but that is how I would do it. Changing schools for sure though.",
            "That's the thing -  we can get everyone involved, but that won't fix the issue for the bullied person. It's unfair, really",
            "yeah they won't forget the scar as long as their alive which is terrible and I do not know how that can be fixed",
            "Therapy, maybe. Lots and lots of therapy.",
            "You're right therapy does work sometimes.",
            "If you can find a good therapist. But that's a whole other issue :) What is it that makes kids into bullies in the first place?",
            "probably their parents at home not giving them enough attention",
            "No doubt. Acting out their anger/frustration on other kids instead of their parents. *sigh*",
            "dont know if they can be blamed though",
            "No, I agree, they're still just kids. Parents need to step up",

            "Why do you feel that way?",
            "Because it is a case of negligence at the core.",
            "Because they left a window open and the toddler pushed through the screen? I know that jumping toward negligence is a common emotional reaction to situations like this, but I think that you're misplacing blame in this instance.",
            "Is it not negligent to make sure the window is closed/access blocked? That's like driving down the road with the door open and blaming the kid when they fall out.",
            "In my view, a screen should provide enough security to allow the parents to leave the window open, you're analogy doesn't track. Perhaps they were just trying to keep their children's room cool on a balmy summer night. Accidents like this happen all the time. If you're intent on holding someone accountable then their really isn't anyone else to blame, but sometimes things just happen.",
            "If you live multiple stories up then you should not leave a window open and if you do access needs to be blocked. Screens are obviously not a deterrent. So yes I think that parents in this situation should be forced to take parenting classes.",
            "Most windows are up high enough on a wall that a child could not just walk through them. The child obviously stacked things inside the room to bring himself to window level and then pressed on the screen hard enough (this would take significant force on a properly installed screen) to fall through the window. The child was also four years old, right? At four, most children would have the presence of mind not to engage in such an activity. This is an odd circumstance all things considered. It's terrible to think of a dead child in any context.",
            "Hard to think about this situation for sure. We cannot really assume how high the window was or how intelligent the child is though. This is for the parents to do. Which brings me back to my point, if you know your kid has the ability to engage in such a behavior, take precautions. My little brother burnt our house down when he was 4. My parents always had child proof lighters after that. There are a ton of examples that can be used but it always comes back to the parents.",
            "I understand your point, but punishing the parents isn't going to bring the child back. I think that every parent could benefit from education on the basics of child rearing.",
            "Right so the \"punishment\" would be more bringing awareness to the parents. Rather than jail time/cps involvement you make them take parenting classes to prevent this from happening again.",
            "I'm pretty sure that they are very aware of the dangers following the events. The real shame is that humanity in general is a very reactive instead of a proactive entity. Tragedies like this are required before any meaningful action is taken across the board.",
            "It is sad for sure. I hope I do not seem too uncaring about this scenario it just triggers anger rather than sympathy as this is something that could have been avoided though I can imagine the parents feel the guilt more than anybody else.",
            "anger is a completely natural response to situations like this I was just picturing the parents sitting in the living room confident in the fact that their children were safe while one lay dead in the parking lot below",
            "Yea I can imagine that was a tough thing to experience. Sucks that their other little kid will never meet his brother.",
            "Yeah, so sympathy was my first response. Do you have children?",
            "I do not have children but do have nieces and nephews. I am able to feel sympathy, anger and be critical at the same time though. Sympathy doesn't change the facts.",
            "Well, considering we don't have all the facts I think that's a pretty foolish statement.",
            "Fact 1- the window was left open with only a screen. Fact 2- the screen was not secured in place. Fact 3- The parents could not heard from the living room to the kids room. Those seem to be easily understood facts.",
            "Your second and third facts are assumptions. The screen could have been secure, but the full weight of a four year old child being pressed against it over an extended period of time could certainly dislodge it. The whole process could have been relatively silent as those details weren't included in the article, hence my statement about having all the facts. It seems your anger is causing you to attempt to establish things as fact that simply can't be substantiated. Thanks for chatting! bye",

            "Definitely. I  undertand how my parents feel now when i was younger and did reckless things.",

Either they appreciated the companionship and comfort of having the other person there, or it was worse because they knew neither would get out, and perhaps one even caused the death of the other.",

            "A rockslide sounds about right. Are they sure they fell? What if they got eaten by an animal.",
            "I thought it said they fell, although maybe I'm misremembering, or assumed that incorrectly.  But yeah, it could be a lot of things.  Getting lost, animals.  I suppose they could have even gotten sick eating something, although they were just hiking so they probably wouldn't need to eat anything they found.",

            "I'm thinking bullying by other kids that can be tough on kids that have never experienced it before.",
            "Yeah that's exactly what I was thinking too.  I read a lot in the news about children who have committed suicide as a result of bullying, it's really heartbreaking.  IT seems so frequent.",
            "and with social media it only gets worse",

            "do you think some blame can be placed on the parents of kids that commit suicide?",
            "that's kinda hard to say.  I mean, I guess one could argue that the parents could have failed to do things to protect their children in some cases.  I can't imagine if my child were being bullied and just failing to act.  And parents that allow their children to be exposed to things they shouldn't be.  I really don't know, though.  You'd have to judge that on a case by case basis I think.  What do you think?",
            "I agree it depends on the case.",

            "a lot of parents unfortunately do disregard the signs",
            "yeah that's terrible and seems like neglect",
            "its a crime in my opinion",
            "yes, maybe eventually the legal system will see it that way too",
            "its the logical thing to do considering what the kids go through",
            "Yes I agree it makes sense and a parent has a duty to protect.  Well I must unfortunately go, it has been a pleasure speaking with you and I hope you have a nice day.  goodbye",

I'm not a big fan of zoos in the first place. Noble animals deserve respect and no matter how well maintained a zoo may be they are still imprisoning living creatures.",

            "Not only were the animals starved to death, but their bodies were stuffed and mounted under the guise of posterity for a conflict that minimally affected the aggressor in the first place. I'm so glad that there are organizations out there keeping tabs on this kind of cruelty.",

            "Well altneratives really depend on what type of mine it was. Basically for coal stop using fossils fuels. We have the ability to use wind, solar and water and we need to focus more on that. For minerals and gold and such, we need to figure out new manufacturing processes or start limiting the desire for those types of things so that mining isn't worth it.",

            "I am afraid that for a lot of things you might be right. I'd hope we could make the change because it's the right thing to do. However, I fear that for a lot of things it's going to come down to we have no other choice. Sad to think, but people don't often change unless forced to.",
            "Change is scary. People are afraid of what they don't understand and that is why human society has had no long lasting fundamental shifts in centuries. Our only hope is that our past won't be forgotten once we get a chance to start over.",
            "I'd like to hope that we'd learn from our mistakes, but it seems we only learn the lesson for so long and then we backslide. I think it's not even so much fearing the change as the fact that so many people fear for their money and industry that makes money now are things we need to move away from.",

But war is life and death.  I believe that if you aren't willing to fight in a way that MOST protects your own troops and your own nation, then you shouldn't fight at all.",

From an objective perspective I don't think there's any authority that should prevent someone from doing that if that's what they think is right.  But obviously I don't agree with it because it affected my home country.  I understand your point but it really doesn't change anything I've said.",

But if trouble finds me, whoa nelly, look out.  Why should I play by a set of \"feel good\" rules and harm myself in the process.",

            "Look at the US involvement in the middle east. Iraq is worst and Libya is now a hell hole.",
            "Yeah, I'm not arguing with what you said (although I personally don't agree).  I'm just trying to understand.  Are you concerned that the Houthis are backed by Iran, and are being used by Iran to increase their influence in the region?",
            "We do not live over there, We can not say why they are fighting. We only get news reported to us. I do not think Iran can do any major damage to the US.",
            "I think it's pretty clear the Iranians are involved.  They're fighting proxy wars all over the place.  They're an existential threat to Israel, our top alley in the region.  Besides, when (not if) they get a nuke, plus ICMBs, they present a threat to a huge chunk of the world, far beyond the region, including possibly us through a suitcase bomb or dirty bomb.",
            "By your own logic, Israel if full of coach roaches too, (I do not agree) So why care what happens to them?",
            "Sure, but they're OUR cockroaches.  Also, I'm sorry, but Iran is truly bad.  I understand the the US does bad stuff, but it's not state-sponsored terrorism like Iran.  We're not the bad guys in the world.  I know that post-911 and post-Iraq we often like to think we're really the bad guys.  But no, Iran is bad.  Russia is bad.  China is bad.  North Korea is bad.  There are levels of bad, and these guys are the worst.",
            "I agree, but we are not messing with Russia or China if we really wanted to go after the bad guys.",
            "We should do more with them, I think.  Not a hot war, where the ramifications are too great though.  See, I'm realistic too.  Anyway, interesting chat.  Thanks.  bye",

            "I'm sure.  History appears to change but, as you say, man's instincts remain the same.  I think all the time, not just in desperate circumstances.",

Like, the so called crisis at our southern border. There are thousands of desperate people being forced into what amount to for-profit prisons funded by tax payer money. Do you think the people running those prisons want to rectify the issue with immigration? Of course not.",

These aren't just the problems of individual people, these are the problems of whole nations of people. You can only turn a blind eye for so long before that problem comes knocking on your door.",

            "Your solution is to deal with the symptom, not the true disease.  You let countries get infested at the top and become unlivable, and everyone--Africans, Middle Easterners, Asians, and Hispanics--flee into civilized countries.  That's not a long term solution.",
            "What do you consider the true disease?",
            "Allowing dictators and corruption to lead other countries.  As far as I'm concerned the same people who flee their oppression are responsible for it.  They are responsible for their own leadership which they feel forced to flee.  I see no reason why they should piggyback off of our ability to live semi-harmoniously and threaten that.",
            "You do realize that the US often backs and installs the despotic governments that contravene the public's wishes and interests in these countries to further their own agenda? The resulting turmoil has our governments fingerprints all over it, so that try as they might to elect leaders that work for them they are headed off at every turn by international interest. You're claiming we have no responsibility to these people. I don't believe that.",
            "Well, believe what you want, it doesn't change reality.  I do have no responsibility to them.  They have responsibility to themselves.  And the influence the US has in these places is grossly overblown.  Either way these are brown-skinned savages.  Subhumans.",
            "You really think that?",
            "Yes.  I do.  These people have had 10,000 years to become civilized.  They haven't.  Look at Africa.  It's a joke. EVERYTHING they have of modern culture is from empirialism.  Anyway, enlightening chat.  Thanks for having it with me.  bye",

            "Now that I think about my sister is married to someone about 10 years apart from her I guess it is normal nowadays lol.",
            "Yeah that's doable, but anything more is still getting weird.  What do you think about the blood vial thing?",
            "you mean when they wore the blood of each other around their necks? that was some intense stuff to read. I don't know what to think of that, just weird.",
            "Yeah I just find that to be a publicity stunt.  Keeps their names in the news.",
            "hollywood people are just weird, there are a lot of weirdos in that business.",
            "Yeah.  Do you think they're strange so they got into hollywood? Or are they strange because they got into hollywood?",
            "It's a little bit of both. I'm pretty su re there a lot of pedophiles in hollywood as well, a secret ring. It's just not a place you'd want to be at.",
            "Lol yeah you're probably right.  I'm sure there's a lot of Weinsteins, but concentrated on kids.",
            "Yeah I wouldn't be surprised if the rumors about that were true.",
            "You probably just end up getting into crazy stuff because of their schedule, and ability to form meaningful relationships with other people.",
            "imagine what the hollywood actors that start from childhood. Those are the ones that end up the worst.  Just look at all the stories of childhood stars and how they end up.",
            "Yeah you're really screwing with a kids brain when you put them in the limelight that early.  Not to bring basketball into it, but that's why I always appreciated Lebron James.   A star at an early age, yet he turned out to be a pretty stand up guy.",
            "Thats true or someone like Kobe Bryant who came out of High School as well.",
            "Yeah.  Thing is though, Lebron was a star at 13, and he's been faithfully married (as far as we know) to the same girl since like 20.  Can't say the same about Kobe.",
            "Kobe unfortunately will always be the better player and have had the better career but I see what you mean about Lebron.",
            "LOL WE HAVE AN EXTREME DISAGREEMENT NOW!",
            "I'm a Laker fan and can't accept Lebron as the better player sorry.",
            "He is far and away the better player.  Kobe is a volume shooter, and good defender, but Lebron is sooo much more efficient with the ball on offense, and his defense is clearly better than Kobe.",
            "Game on the line , NBA finals, last shot to win the game, you choose Kobe plain and simple. The Black Mamba is the closest thing we ever saw to MJ.",
            "He was like a poor mans MJ.  Lebron however is a completely different player.  Unfortunately for Kobe too, the game isn't just decided in the last shot, it's decided by the other 100 before it as well.",
            "It's something we will never agree on lol. It was the best talk I ever had in one of these hits though thanks man!! Definitely wish you the best. goodbye",
            "Lol same here! goodbye"

            "Ah, that may explain why I'm not familiar. Are your parents married?",
            "Yup. Married for many years and still together so i don't know what they're going through. I'm sure it's tough. What about you?",
            "My parents split when I was five. I really had a hard time dealing with it during my teenage years. So, I can empathize to a certain extent. I think it would be easier to process as an adult.",
            "I am sorry to hear that. Were you old enough to really understand and realize what happened with your parents?",
            "Divorce is something that unfolds as a child matures. At the time I was aware of the situation, but unfamiliar with the emotions and change that came with your parents splitting up. My father was absent for the lions share of my childhood years, so I spent a lot of time asking why.",
            "Ah, so sorry you had to go through all of that. Didn't mean to bring those thoughts back in your head.",
            "No worries. Anyway, I think that if two people are unhappy together divorce is the best option for all concerned.",
            "Definitely. There's no point in staying together if you're going to fight and argue, especially in front of your children.",
            "Exactly, two happy and constructive homes are a far sight better than one unhappy one.",

            "Haha exactly. I remember Dakota Fanning from when I was a kid but were his parents really ever in movie's themselves?",
            "Wait Dakota is a guy? I thought he was that little girl that played in Uptown Girls with Brittany Murphy. whoops. I don't think so, I've never heard of them but then again I apparently am way off on who I thought any of these people were lol",
            "It appears that I'm the one out of touch. She is indeed a girl. The point remains..why are her parents in the news :D",
            "hahaha who knows. Some reporter somewhere apparently thinks we care about this. I feel sorry for them. Like who wants their divorce splashed all over the news?",
            "Ehh I wonder. Sometimes it seems that certain celebrities like it and others don't. I am a private person so I really do not understand this type of thing.",
            "Same here. I don't know why you'd ever enjoy having your personal life and situations splashed on every tabloid. I can understand somewhat if you're a celeb. It comes with the job, but if her parents aren't famous except by her it seems terrible to publish their business",
            "Do you think her parents put this in the news themselves?",
            "Maybe I guess I just can't wrap my head around the why. They aren't famous themselves (I don't think) unless they're trying to create some fame",
            "Maybe they're trying to get some fame :D. It seems that the dad just up and left though. The article mentioned that he is not fighting that hard for the assets.",
            "I guess maybe it was amicable? Maybe one of those situations where they stay together till the kids are grown",
            "I guess it would be weird to fight over money your kid made for the most part anyway.",
            "that is true. neither one are probably really entitled to any of it lol",
            "If I was in this position I can't see myself even keeping any of it. I would feel embarrassed",
            "I would be too. I'd feel like I was embarrassing my kid too.",
            "At least there aren't stories about them stealing their kid's money. I've heard this happened with Gary Coleman",
            "And Malculay Caulkin. I think his stepdad stole millions from all 8 of his kids",
            "That's super sad. I mean you already have your kid working at a super early age(whether they see it as work or not) and to steal from them is despicable.",
            "yeah no kidding. It's child labor and the kid doesn't even get anything out of it except a lifetime of emotional problems. Like every child star on Disney",
            "Lol and lets not even get into the rumors about the shady stuff that goes on. I mean I get that movies and shows need kids to act in them but I don't think as a parent I could like force my kids to be actors if they didn't push it themselves.",
            "No same here. I'm choosing a simple ordinary life for my kids maybe poorer but happier in the long run",
            "And they can actually have a normal childhood. Imagine if your kid was like 10 and paparazzi were always hounding him for pictures. I can imagine that would mess up normal development in a way",
            "I can't even imagine what that would do to a kid",
            "I have no more thoughts on the topic haha. Nice chatting with you. bye",

I feel terrible about the kids there that have been indoctrinated. The poor parents may never have their kids back.",

            "I haven't seen any progress. I think that the more our military has a presence there, the more hostile the area becomes until it's completely destabilized. This is one of the paths towards radicalization. I will never get over the fact that they are brainwashing children to be cold blooded killers.",
            "Yea that's really disturbing. It kind of highlights the animalistic nature of man if twisted at an early age.",
            "Yeah for sure. I can only imagine the brutal techniques used to radicalize them at such a young age. They should be doing kid stuff. Not being forced to participate in avts of war.",

            "That's what I was wondering too.  Are the tourists actually the ones killing them, or are they getting attacked more, so officials have to kill the bears?",
            "It was a pretty short article so i'm not sure. Either way, poor polar bears. :(",
            "Yeah it's like, if we're not completely destroying their environment, we're gonna tour into whats left of it, and kill them that way.  Tough life for a Polar Bear.",
            "How can we help the polar bears? :(",
            "I think other than the basics of respecting our environment, and voting in political candidates who would enact policies, I\"m not sure there is much we can do.",
            "Maybe the tourists are stealing all of the polar bear's food.",
            "Lol I hope tourists aren't eating seal pups... I'm sure just the interaction ends with having to kill polar bears. I know that happens frequently where I'll go hiking.  There will be a bear attack, and officials then have to find and kill the bear, otherwise they'll attack more humans.",
            "oh no that's terrible! It's not the bear's fault",
            "No, but I think humans have this innate feeling that the world is ours for the taking.  Not sure how we correct that though.",
            "Probably no way. I just feel bad for them. Imagine killing a mother polar bear.. what's going to happen to the babies?! It's all so sad.",
            "Yeah.  I watch a lot of BBC nature programs too.  I'm sure a lot of it is edited, but everytime they show footage of polar bears, you're left holding back tears.",
            "I don't even hold back my tears. I just bawl because it's so sad. I remember seeing a video where a hawk ate one of the babies.",
            "Ha, as sad as that is though, that doesn't bug me. Circle of life shit.  That's how nature is supposed to be.  What bugs me is when you see how humans are disrupting the natural cycle of things, and other animals pay for it.",
            "That's true. I definitely don't do all that i can to help the environment",
            "I've definitely been trying to do more the last several years.  It can get kind of depressing though when you realize what a small impact you can actually have.",
            "really? one person can make an impact?",
            "I mean, you don't have any other choice in my opinion.  I try to get others to follow suit as well.  Grassroots type stuff.  I also try to ensure that I'm not overbearing about it though, I think that turns people off.",

            "I am inclined to agree. Partially. I understand that greed is very powerful, but it is the lowest of all human emotions. I think people can rise above it someday. I hope it's not too late when we do",
            "That article was lacking so much information. Would be nice to know what steps they are taking to try to protect the bears. I think a video was supposed to be included.",
            "I agree. I was also wondering how many polar bears were affected. What steps do you think should be taken?",
            "I'm not really sure. I mean, if people have legitimate reasons for being there and are in danger of being attacked by a polar bear, they should have the right to defend themselves. But maybe restricting access to the places where these bears are would work? I'm not really sure.",
            "I doubt anyone has a truly legitimate reason for being that close to polar bear habitats. How do you think conservation efforts as a whole can be improved?",
            "I bet the practices they are doing is good, just probably needs more funding. I feel like any kind of \"save the insert animal here\" effort is promoted it doesn't get very much traction, people don't seem to care. Which ultimately will lead to funding problems, they end up cutting corners or not being able to do everything they planned, and more animals die.",
            "What makes you think that people don't seem to care?",
            "Well, care in the sense that they are motivated to effect change. The news media certainly isn't pushing these stories to the top. I'm sure people care enough to sign a petition or something along those lines, but would they even donate money? Who knows. What do you think about what's being done so far?",
            "I think humanity needs to do much more. I agree about the media not focusing on these issues. I think government needs to do much more to protect endangered animals and hold people accountable. Do you think the issue regarding the polar bears in the article may be related to climate change?",
            "It's certainly possible. At least the warming of the climate effecting polar bears in general, probably not the issue of visitors killing them. You are right the government should be doing more. But that all goes back to people not caring. Listen to any politician speak, they won't say anything about protecting any endangered animals, it's all health care, economy, illegal immigration etc",
            "Maybe the polar bears are coming into contact with humans more because their habitat is melting away. The politicians will talk about whatever they think people want to hear. What do you think is a good way to get people to care more about conservation issues?",
            "Yeah that certainly is possible. Raising awareness is one area. I didn't know  there were problems with the polar bears in Norway until reading this article. More attention needs to be on these issues. Although, there's so many animals being threatened, do you think we run the risk of flooding people with too much and people being overwhelmed and just ignoring it all?",
            "That is certainly a possibility. But too much information is better than too little. What might be some ways to get people more actively involved once awareness has been raised?",
            "Petitions, donation drives, contacting politicians and informing them these are issues you care about. I suppose all of those could help. I'm not sure it's enough though.",
            "I am sure all these things would be helpful, but I am not convinced it would be enough. I would propose a more hands on approach by taking people to actively patrol conservation zones are at least to a zoo or similar area so they can have some face to face time with these animals. What do you think>",
            "Yeah I'm sure that would convince some, but in order for real change, it would require a large number of people to make this an important issue for them. How many people are gonna take off work to go to the zoo lol.",
            "With sufficient motivation there is nothing stopping what someone will do. The question is how do we get people sufficiently motivated? I would really miss the polar bears when they are all gone",
            "If I'm being honest, I don't think I would. In fact, I doubt I'd even notice if it did happen. I've never seen one person, and I don't think they would have any impact on my life. I do believe they should be saved, but in terms of what I would be willing to do to help? Probably not much.",
            "Wow. Why wouldn't you be willing to help?",
            "What could I do? I could donate money. What else could one person do to have a meaningful impact on polar bears in Norway? Then there's the elephants in Africa, the dolphins are also being killed off in mass, etc etc etc",
            "So you feel overwhelmed?",
            "Well, not so much overwhelmed, but just that there isn't anything more than just donating money I could realistically do. Unless I wanted to travel to Norway and volunteer with the organization that is tasked with protecting the bears. Which isn't realistic for me.",
            "What could be some other realistic ways for you to get involved beside donating money?",
            "That's the thing, I can't really think of any.",
            "There has to be some interesting way you can make a contribution outside of giving a donation",
            "Do you have any ideas?",
            "I mentioned them already. I would rather not suggest anything punitive like fines or taxes",
            "Yeah, I don't think people would agree with more taxes anyway.",
            "I am trying to think of something like earth day where some people plant trees. That is a great conservationist effort",
            "Yeah, that could be a good way to raise awareness at least. Well, I enjoyed this conversation with you. goodbye",

            "That's probably part of it, although I don't know much about the Burmese economy.  But overpopulation is a big problem, too.  And corrupt governments.",

            "It's interesting how it works though.  Western countries aren't having kids at rates fast enough to replinish the population.  So it's immigrants from less-civilized nations growing the population.  In other words, an irony: the people who can't sustain themselves (as well) are the ones growing the population.",

            "Yeah.  I guess it's just got to be a grass roots thing where citizens say their countries aren't going to act that way anymore, and it trickles up into authority and the governments themselves.",
            "I think that government actions from foreign nations could help. Embargoes placed until countries do something but this is hard to see happening.",
            "Yeah, that would probably help.  But it's a logistical nightmare.  Can countries like the U.S. and E.U. really \"police\" this stuff and monitor it enough to truly make a difference.  Look at this story.  What was the result of an international agency getting involved.  They PAID OFF the guy who enslaved the kids.  In other words, they ENCOURAGED him to do it again.  (Admittedly, he was later arrested.)  But we have to be careful about HOW we intervene, not just that we do.",
            "Did they pay him off? I thought the kids were compensated not the business.",
            "No, they paid for the children's release.  That's how I read it.",

            "That's another part of it.  There's always some attempt to respect the sovereignty of nations.  But at what point do you intervene because you believe you know better.",

Without some serious intervention and consequences this ugly practice will continue, I mean just look at our own history. It took the Civil War to end slavery, without it who knows how long slavery would have lasted",

True, there are probably success stories where they nurse them back to health and find them homes, but when they see these animals the first time they're always in a bad place.",

            "I guess these people working with the orphaned animals probably feel it's about all they can do for the cause.  I'm not sure what else people can do to influence poaching in a meaningful way.",

I assume at higher levels these organizations lobby countries to crack down harder on poaching, but of course there's money involved, so there's corruption, and these are sovereign nations anyway, so outsiders can only exert so much influence.",

            "I came up similarly. My grandparents had a ranch and all the wildlife that comes with it. Do you believe that animals deserve the same rights as humans?",
            "I totally do. They have just as much right to life and be protected as humans. We can both share this planet and by taking care of animals we do our part to keep the balance in nature.",
            "I completely agree. Animals are often more loyal and loving than most humans. We need them more than we care to admit as a species and that's not just mammals, birds and insects are an important part of the equation also.",
            "I couldn't agree more. My dogs are part of my family. I can't imagine treating animals with less respect than another human, as you say they are often more deserving of compassion than some people. Even those animals we raised for food, we treated them with care and respect. That's how it should be. Do onto others applies to animals the same as people in my mind.",
            "My family spoils their dogs rotten. I don't think they could be happier with their position in life, and that makes me glad. I volunteer as a foster pet parent and developing a bond of trust with a troubled pup is one of the most rewarding things. What kind of dogs do you have?",
            "I would love to foster, but I get so attached so easily I'd never want to give them up. Ours are spoiled as well, they run the house more than we do. I have a yellow lab and a lab/german shorthair mix.",
            "Yeah, it's really hard to let them go. I'm reassured by knowing that they are being sent to a happy home where they will be loved and cared for.",
            "Yes, even knowing that in the end I'm giving another family a chance to have that special relationship with a dog. Bringing all that love into a new family would be wonderful but still so hard. I'm so glad there are people like you that can give that to new families and animals, it's such a rewarding and amazing thing.",
            "It really is! Thanks so much for chatting today. It was really pleasant (^_^) bye",
            "I had a nice time chatting with you as well. goodbye"

            "It might.  But Saudis are proud.  If you go telling the King and his people that what they're doing is morally wrong, I think they're just as likely to spite you as to listen.",

            "I think \"wrongness\" is something that's not as simple as it might seem.  It's easy for us to criticize it from the outside, but we also weren't raised in that culture and see it very differently.  Also, the male-female dynamics inside relationships and homes are very different than the societal restraints put on women.",
            "It's not just us criticizing it but what sounds like a lot of women in that country as well. Social restraints are not the same thing as having to listen to your husband as if he was your parent.",
            "What about the Saudi women who want the system to stay the same?  Do you think they're brainwashed, or suffering from Stockholm Syndrome?  Or do you think their perspective is valid too?  Just curious.",
            "I think their perspective is valid but definitely a  mixture of brainwashing or could just be it's scary to have to take a stand against the old system. It's probably easier for a lot of women to not buck the norm and face hellish consequences.",
            "I think you exaggerate the consequences, but I understand your point.  My brother actually lives in Saudi Arabia and, as I said before, the male-female relational dynamics at a personal level are quite different from the systemic restraints.",
            "Hard to say exactly what the consequences would be but I'd bet that some women would have it worse than others. I wonder how this situation impacts women without a husband. Are they allowed these freedoms or are they forced to marry?",
            "I don't believe they're legally forced to marry, but since employment is limited, it's sort of a necessity.",
            "But this unmarried woman would still not be allowed to drive, leave the country, make her own doctor's appointments and such?",
            "I believe women are actually now allowed to drive.  I could be wrong about that but I think that was a recent change.  However, no, she'd have to get a male relative to sign off on her leaving the country.  Not sure about things like doctor's appointments. That might actually be the opposite, where it might be considered inappropriate for a man to be involved in that.  But not sure.",
            "Ahh I remember the article stating that women needed permission when undergoing hospital treatment. It's hard for me to see the benefits of this limited freedom, social norm or not.",
            "I think the social media and internet influence in this is interesting.  i can imagine the women at home, spending a lot of time on their phones, seeing lives they want to be leading and that, in part, motivating them to seek change.  On some level it's no different than people in the West seeing a pair of sneakers they want, or a vacation one their friends took, and being desirous of that, too.",
            "Yea I can imagine that's part of it. No person should have to sit and dream about basic freedoms that 99% of other adult women have the option to make. And then being forced to remain in the country as well.",
            "Do you think the number is really as high as 99%  I think patriarchal cultures are still more prevalent than that.",
            "Probably closer to 90% but I do not know of many other countries that restrict the right of women. Maybe this is more common in middle eastern countries",

            "Exactly. Who enjoys seeing such misery inflicted on others? I can't even begin to imagine how someone like that can do something like this. It's clear that Russia has a problem and then to see someone doing something like encouraging more deaths. It's sickening.",
            "It really is!  I have heard of some of these suicide sites before and I find it appalling and sickening.  People should be trying to help the situation not fuelling the fire.  What on earth.",
            "I know. I just can't understand the mindset of people that find this enjoyable or acceptable. You'd like to believe that these troubled kids could go online to find the help they need that they can't or aren't getting at home. Intead, they are used as a sick game to disgusting people. Unreal.",
            "It really is unreal.  And it said that some of the owners of the sites they had found were not much older than the children they were targeting.  What would even compel someone to do something like this?",
            "I really don't know. I can't even begin to wrap my head around how someone must think to do this. It's like bullying. They said it fed their egos? Who enjoys knowing they hurt other people?",
            "Yeah what on earth?  Like it makes them feel powerful or something?  I have no idea but it sounds like the mindset of a serial killer to me.  Which in a way, those people kinda are serial killers.",
            "Yeah, it'd say they are. It's crazy that someone would relish doing this kind of thing. How does someone even think that this is something appealing to them? How does it even get started. I just don't know why or what you can do to stop something like this.",
            "Yeah I have no idea, I am as mindblown as you are.  They should really have a special punishment for people like that who prey on these types of young victims.  I guess with every site you shut down another new one can just pop right back up.  That's the scary thing about the internet.",
            "It is. I don't want to start down a censorship slope, but you can see why the idea has merit. If you can't stop people from using the internet to harm others, what choice do you have? I'd like to believe parents or schools or someone could step in to help these troubled kids and lead them away from the internet that is causing them more harm than good.",
            "Yes, ultimately it should be the parents who are censoring and policing things like that at home but obviously in these cases the parents are failing to do that job.  So who can step in to help?",
            "I wish I knew. That is why this is continuing I suppose. And the fact that people don't like to talk about suicide, as if it's a dirty secret. Hopefully, more talk can lead to more people being aware online and doing more to keep shutting sites down.",
            "Yeah, like if they got things like this more out in the open.",
            "Have more warnings about the dangers. Try to find what it is that lures kids to these sights and try and use those same tactics to lead them to locations of help rather than these nasty suicide cults or whatever they are.",
            "Yes and maybe have very harsh punishments for the offenders they catch.",
            "Yes, do more than shut the sites down. Track the people that are putting them up and doing more to punish their behavior.",
            "Yes! Like charge them with homicide.  It has been nice discussing this tragic topic with you.  goodbye",

            "I guess I think it's sad that kids feel so sad and alienated (or whatever) that they are drawn to them.  But I also think it's pitiful that people lose themselves in internet groups like this.  It's artificial.",
            "Artificial? How do you mean?",
            "I just think that the emotions we experience online are very different--much more intense--than what we experience in reality.  Ironically.  If we'd turn off our phones and the TV and went outside, we'd discover that there's a big difference between the virtual worlds on our screens, and the real world.  And the time we spend in the virtual ones doesn't seem to be good for our mental health, especially when we're already vulnerable.",
            "It's true, a disturbing amount of humans put more effort into cultivating and maintaining a paltry digital simulacrum of themselves than they do their actual body/mind/relationships. I think in a lot of ways, for children growing up in our world, the digital world is much more real than the one that physically surrounds them everyday.",
            "I agree, and I think that's sad.  It's ironic that in mental health, mindfulness is the current push.  And I think that the way we engage with the internet is the antithesis of being mindful.  So you have this strange dichotomy where more people need, or think they need, mental health help, which will push them towards things like mindfulness, while those same people do the exact opposite thing while engaging in their virtual worlds.",
            "Mindfulness, in essence, is non-committal engagement of ones thoughts and feelings; acknowledging them as they are and letting them pass over you. The internet, on the other hand, is potentially a coliseum of unhinged emotional responses to both real world and subjective events and opinions. I think you're absolutely correct. People in our society are very quick to diagnose themselves, but rarely exert the effort to actually plumb the depths of their personal experience with a person who is qualified to make those diagnoses.",
            "I'd suggest that in this story, the parents are most capable of providing help, in all ways, but apparently the parents are a large part of the problem, what with the drinking and abuse and whatnot.",
            "I think they are the most capable and most incapable in the same turn depending on the circumstances. I think more actual community involvement is key in these types of situations. Less time online and more time interacting with human beings toward a common goal.",
            "The statistics intrigued me.  First, the inordinately high depression and suicide rates for Russia.  But also the 5% number (teenage depression, I believe it was) for the rest of the West.  That number seems low to me, though I don't really know.",
            "If factor in western countries with higher quality of life (Noway, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands) whose suicide rates are less then 1% i'm sure it skews the data.",
            "I'd also suggest that the FOCUS on the internet communities themselves is maybe misguided.  Seems like a whack-a-mole problem in terms of shutting them down.",
            "It's much easier to make a half hearted effort to apply blame and deal with superficial corollaries of social problems than address them at the root.",
            "Absolutely.  A culture of victimhood.  But it does nothing to help the actual kids.",
            "No, meaningful action against this problem would require time, money, empathy and a sense of duty to ones fellow man that is very scarce in the world today. It's the equivalent of cutting hair and just expecting it not to grow back.",
            "I also wonder what the right balance is for issues pertaining to mental illness and health.  At what point does \"help\" and \"sympathy\" becoming enabling and rationalizing?  When does trying to eliminate stigma becoming encouraging people to self-diagnose and use mental health as a crutch, or excuse.",
            "Well, help and sympathy are two mutually exclusive concepts. A lot of the time people who are experiencing intense isolation just need someone to talk to. I think that people who are actually diagnosed rely too heavily on prescription medication (which are only supposed to be a temporary crutch) and prefer to ignore the human element in therapy which is often the most beneficial.",
            "I'd agree with that.  In all parts of medicine, prescribing a pill has become the easy, satisfying thing to do. I'm flabbergasted when I see reports quoting the number of people taking things like Ambien.",
            "Ambien, antibiotics, anti-depressants. It's a depressing and short sighted landscape to be sure. Thanks so much for chatting. I think you were probably the most insightful person so far. bye",

            "Tell me what you think about the article?",
            "I was alarmed by some of the high suicide rates in Russian adolescents. I had no idea it was  so high and prevalent.",
            "I feel so sad about it",
            "Were you aware that adolescent suicide rates are also on the rise here in the US?",
            "Yes i was surprised when i found out",
            "I think it is very telling that the suicides in Russia can be directly linked to social media groups. The rise of adolescent suicide here in the US directly parallels the growth and popularity of social media",
            "I will agree with that",
            "Why do you think Russian teens are embracing this online suicide culture?",
            "Maybe it is more about mental health?",
            "It could be that. Do you think socioeconomic factors play a role?",
            "Yes, i think so too",
            "Which specific factors were you thinking of?",
            "I'm actually more concerned about the mental health status. I think it is the major factor",
            "I think that can play a role, but Russia has the 3rd highest rate of adolescent suicide, 20%. Furthermore 45% of Russian teenage girls reported thoughts of suicide and 27% of teenage boys did the same. I think there is much more going on",
            "wow, those are large numbers",
            "Yea disturbingly large. I think social media paints a portrait of a lifestyle that is beyond the reach of many young Russians. Coupled with poor economic prospects many of them fall into despair, apathy, and hopeless thoughts.",
            "what do you think can be done to prevent this?",
            "I think one solution would be to require social media websites to offer online counseling services to their users, particularly to those who are at risk",
            "I totally agree with that. goodbye",
            "What suggestions do you have?",
            "Well, i think more awareness should be done so people with mental health can get help",
            "I agree, but the trouble is that mental illness is not always easy to spot and sometimes these people are difficult to treat because of that",
            "More awareness means urging people with it to get help which i believe some will willing want to get help as well.",
            "Maybe you're right. I also think we should discourage young people from idolizing vapid ''public figures'' and ''influencers'' they encounter on social media. Most of those people do not add value to society",
            "That is absolutely correct",
            "I am wondering why we are not having a similar debate about these issues here in the US",
            "I think it is about priorities.",
            "What makes you say that?",
            "Maybe there are more important this people focused on",
            "Don't you think that teen suicide is important enough to focus on?",
            "Yes i do, but sadly so many people do not.",

            "yeah I wish they made it easier.  The trash situation in general out here sucks.  some people pay a service to come pick up their trash but we can't afford that.  so there ya go.  but it is sad about those birds in the ocean.  I bought re-usable water bottles for us so we try to minimize our trash",

            "I thought the science behind why the birds eat plastic was interesting.",
            "Yeah, I would have never guessed that the plastic gives off the same \"scent\" as food.  Weird.",
            "I also thought is was telling that all the worst countries in the world at dumping plastic in the ocean are Asian.  They're really bad about that stuff, obviously.",
            "I think that statistic was misleading though.  From what I understand, they're the largest polluters, because we (the west) ship them all our trash.",
            "Could be.  I think they're attitudes about trash and pollution are different from ours though.",
            "I'm sure.  I think they also can't afford to have the same opinions as us.  In fact, I just remembered how one of those countries, perhaps Indonesia, just shipped back several thousands of tons of trash back to Europe, as they said they were shipped against their wishes.",
            "I wonder if there will be, or can be, any change to the composition of the plastics so they don't give off this sulphurous odor.",
            "I would rather see them change the root cause.  Less pollution.  I think we as americans have been turning a blind eye to these issues too long, and that needs to change.",
            "Sure.  I think people are lazy, though, so there will always be a ton of waste since there will always be a ton of consumption.",
            "Right.  So maybe we need to get away from one time consumables, and move to products that are biodegradable.  I know that this issue of paper straws, and no plastic bags is mocked quite often, but it's a movement that needs to happen.",
            "\"Needs\" in what sense?",
            "Are you asking what defines my use of the word, \"needs\"?",
            "I guess I'm looking for specific ramifications from us doing otherwise.  Needs is a strong word.  What exactly will happen if we don't ban plastic straws that makes that action imperative.",
            "Well that is a question that would need to be answered at a different time, as there is waaay too much for this venue, but for starters, banning plastic straws should just be the start.  The plastics and oil industry is probably the most toxic thing to happen to this planet.  Plastics are in everything.  That not only creates pollution in the oceans, kills wildlife and changes ecosystems, but it is the primary contributor to global warming.  Too many people selectively listen to their bought and paid for politicians and lobbyists, and don't buy the conecpt of climate change, but oh well, I'll get off my soapbox",
            "That's fine, I don't mind listening to people's concerns.  I have my own.  From a practical perspective, do you think there's a WILL to make these changes, even if there's a WAY?",
            "Not really.  I think too many people think the change needs to happen from up top, instead of themselves making the change.  I think most people don't understand that we vote/enact change with out wallets, and too many americans are too greedy to have any foresight, and concern themselves with any issue that don't take place in their immediate bubble.",
            "Yes, I agree with that.  I think convenience is also an extremely big part of it.  I also think few people are willing to take steps \"backwards\" in terms of quality of life, even if they do care about issues like these.  And I think there's another problem, which is that humans have a very hard time appreciating dangers that they've never experienced.  Our brains just aren't very good at imagining repercussions, or taking them seriously, when we haven't experienced those things yet.",
            "Agreed.  I also think our brains have a difficult time comprehending things that don't occur in our experienced time frames.  Hearing time scales of thousands or millions or billions of years is something most people can't wrap their brains around, so when scientists bring up changes that are occuring, normal people shrug it off as something that will be overcome, or has already happened before.",
            "Yes, as you say, back to our own immediate bubble.  At some point real weather events that directly impact people might prompt some change.  Maybe, I'd be interested to know if people who get wiped out by a hurricane or flooding change their attitudes about environmental stuff, or do even those people not change.  I think that'd be interesting data.",
            "I live in a hurricane area, and I don't think weather events will change anything.  It'll just be the same narrative.  \"This has always happened\", \"I've seen this before.\"  Because even our current crisis of climate change will take place over 50 to 100 years, the effects will not be immediately obviously visible, and people will continue to shrug it off until it's too late.",
            "Yes, I think that's a good point.  It's easy to go back to believing everything is normal.  And it might be too late anyway.  Well, nice chatting with you.  Have a nice day.  bye",

            "Yes, a great idea and a good way to begin to try and keep more plastic out of our water systems. If everyone did one simple thing perhaps we could be saving our sea life and making the environment better. Proud to see steps taken to make such a difference.",
            "What do you think are some ways we can help reduce plastic waste in the ocean?",
            "I believe we need to stop using so many plastic products. Recycle more and make sure that it is being recycled and not just dumped somewhere later. It will take a lifestyle change to do more to make sure that we reduce the need for plastaic.",

            "I find myself on the fence about this article. While I feel sympathy for those fleeing dangerous situations in their home countries, I also understand Germany not wanting to just open it's doors to everyone. Very much like situations we're facing here in the US at this time. What are your thoughts on the situation?",
            "I agree, it appears that the system is overburdened as well.",
            "It does seem so. I find it interesting that Germany makes decisions based on where the people are coming from as well. We hear so often how the US is the only country being selective or not wanting too many refugees but everyone is facing similar situations.",
            "Well, I think their priority is war torn countries. The claims are easier to prove.",
            "Perhaps. I think the trouble is there are just too many for any country to take them all. Every story is troubling, but wouldn't it be better to focus on improving conditions in those countries rather than letting everyone leave and overburden other countries?",
            "OH, I absolutely agree. But, in the case of a small country like Germany-what can they do? It seems we are no longer aligned with out European neighbors, so relying on the US is worthless.",
            "I believe Germany has to do what it can to protect itself first, otherwise how can it help anyone? I feel bad for some of the people talked about in the article, but I can understand why Germany has had to draw some hard lines.",
            "I feel for them as well. The USA has done very little for immigrants. If we could just help the Syrians, maybe the rest of Europe could help other countries.",
            "I don't agree that the US has done little for immigrants or anyone else. We can't be the world police. We have our own issues and our own borders are overwhelmed by those attempting to flee Central and South America. I think it is a world problem that the world needs to work on to do better. Helping the war torn countries as a whole. The burden shouldn't fall on any one country.",
            "Well, not one country, but countries that have the resources should take on their proportionate share. Canada, for a small country handles immigration rather well.",
            "I don't know much about how Canada handles immigration. I do think the problem isn't about immigration though but why the people are leaving their home countries. I feel that efforts need to be made to solve the problems in the countries people are fleeing to help a larger number of people and reduce the burden on other countries like in Germany that are often overwhelmed by those seeking a safer place to live.",
            "I agree. It seems as if there is no clear solution, especially in case hard to prove. The poor Pakistani man probably faces real danger if he returned to his village, but what about another area of the country. Same with the Nigerian.",
            "I agree. The people highlighted in the story seem to have a true need to find safety somewhere else. Moving to another part of the country as some suggested in the article wouldn't seem to help these people. I agree there are no simple and clear solutions. Each case has its own set of needs which is why the process is so easily overwhelmed.",
            "They same could be said for the many Central Americans coming into the US. Although I take issue when the president claims they are rapist and gang members. Most immigrants just want a better life.",
            "I believe agree that most immigrants are wanting a better life. But for the issues facing the US, it's not the ones waiting in line and going through the immigration process that are the problem. It's the illegals that are crossing the border or being smuggled over that don't get a vetting process that is the problem.",
            "True, but our system is underfunded and overwhelmed as well. I live in Florida and know a few illegals-they are good people and contribute to my community.",
            "Not all illegals are bad. Those that want a better life and come here and live normal lives would be people that would most likely have been able to come into the country legally if we didn't have so many basically cutting the line. It is harsh but just like in the article in Germany, we can't take them all in. There has to be lines drawn and choices made.",
            "In the case of the illegals I know, they were desperate to provide for their families and so- I guess you're right-they cut in line. But I'm not sure they had a choice. their families were starving.",
            "I know there are hard choices to make. But there are plenty facing the same situation that don't cut in line. It's a tough issue for sure and no good solution. Thanks for sharing your thoughts today. goodbye",

            "Hey there.  I find it distressing anytime human technology is leading to the death of animals.  It seems so very frequent and common.  What did you think?",
            "Yes, we certainly have a habit of encroaching on animals' habitats and doing harm to them.",
            "Yes indeed we do.  It's really unfair to them but it's like an inevitable thing as society continues to grow.",
            "Yes, there will always be compromises to be made.  Do we trade more greenhouse gasses for more dead birds, etc.  We're something of an invasive species and will continue to do what we do.  I think the question is just how, precisely, and what we choose to compromise.",
            "Yes I agree.  It seems particularly sad when it is an endangered species that is being compromised.  I did not see anything in the article about what they planned to do to fix the situation, did you?",
            "No, I didn't.  They were just talking about using this finding as further food-for-thought for wind farms.  I've also always wondered whether wind farms affect weather patterns.  You can't just take energy out of the air \"for free.\"  That affects something.  I wonder if, like this bird situation, we truly understand the ramifications of these wind farms, and whether it's the right alternative energy to be pursuing so aggressively.",
            "Yeah I agree with what you are saying completely.  It seems like in trying to fix things, there are often unintended consequences that further harm other things.",
            "Yes, and we start down a path without being fully informed about what the ramifications are.  We did the same thing 100+ years ago with coal and oil!",
            "Yeah totally!  And so many other things.  You would think we would have learned our lesson by now but nope.",
            "Indeed.  I do wonder if there are specific things they can do to protect the birds, though.  Someone must be thinking of something.  Like, scents that deter them, or colors or something.  I don't know much about birds but you'd think there'd be some way to scare them or deter them from those locations.",
            "Yeah that is a really good point.  You would think there would be something.  Surely scientists have vetted this out?",
            "I would think so, but maybe it isn't a high priority or something.  I'm guessing the companies with a vested interest in wind farms don't want the bird killing to be paid attention to.  And maybe animal rights groups don't have the resources or something.  Not sure but I personally never hear that much about wind farms, positive or negative.  Energy talk tends to center around oil and coal.",
            "Yeah I don't hear much about it either.  I don't really seek out that info though but I do read the news every day and I never see anything about it.  I have heard about the bird issue just over the years in different settings.  It seems to be an ongoing issue for sure.",
            "I'd be interested to see how people felt if we just lay all the cards on the table.  Obviously we aren't this knowledgeable, but if we just said, \"These are the pros and cons of wind, solar, oil, nuclear, etc. what do the people prefer?\"  In other words, what do you sacrifice?  Dead birds, cost, nuclear fears, Carbon dioxide/global warming, etc.  I'd be interested to see how people chose because, again, you have to compromise somewhere.",
            "Yeah totally.  It's easy for people to sit there and throw out idealistic notions but when it really came down to the practicality of it all and the pros and cons were laid out including cost, what would people choose",
            "Right.  And I also feel like we, the people, don't get to have that much say.  This is a larger conversation than we have time for, but my energy costs have spiked dramatically in the last few years because the energy company is going towards wind, and it's expensive.  I'm not saying that isn't what I'd ultimately choose, but I don't even get a choice.  I have one utility company and have to accept their monopoly.",
            "That is a good point as far as not getting any input.  Our costs have gone up too and we only have one company to choose from.",
            "The other thing I'd be interested about is what rodent populations are like around these wind farms.  If you kill all the birds of prey, how does that affect these lands for farming or grazing.  You wonder if land owners, who've agreed to have these wind turbines erected on their lands, will regret it.",
            "Oh yes true, ike the other populations will get out of control.  It could set the entire ecosystem out of balance.  Such is the danger when we tamper with nature.  Well I have enjoyed hearing your insights and hope you enjoy your day.  goodbye",
            "Yes, it was great chatting with you.  Have a good day.  bye"

            "i have seen these things. They don't seem to be filled with the corpses of dead birds, though.",
            "I'm thinking of the fields of giant windmills. I see them sometimes when I am driving in rural areas. They are massive and each area has many windmills. It seems that they go on for miles. I can't imagine being a bird and trying to navigate that.",
            "yes. its troublesome that everything we do, we kill some natural, simple thing. It's not u to me, though, but I guess just by having electricity or whatever I'm complicit.",
            "It just really makes you wonder, when we look back on technologies, will we have done the right thing or did we end up damaging the earth more in our efforts to help.",
            "well, we're definetly not trying to help the earth, or if we are, its for our own benifit and no one elses, just so we can keep living",
            "Yeah, it's been a relatively short time that humans have been living on the earth in civilized societies. I can't imagine how long we can continue this without destroying everything.",
            "its troubling. what does life even mean if it can just be wasted, used up on wind turbines or pollution, or green energy, or land deveopment. Just being alive doesn't seem to be worth so much, if it ever was.",
            "A lot of people probably don't think that way. They just have to have all of the latest and greatest and don't really think about how future generations are going to suffer.",
            "but its us, too. you and me, right now, benifiting form all of it. If you could have the choice between a life of air conditioning, or a living bird, what would you do? We've all already made that choice.",
            "You are right. It would be impossible to live in this society without using these things.",
            "bird would do it to us if they got the chance. If they could have shelter and protection a our expense, they wouldn't care. Life is just so cruel and selfish.",
            "I guess that's true, but the bird doesn't have the knowledge that we do. Maybe they can just figure out a way to put giant cages around the windmills or something so that the birds can't fly into the fans.",
            "or a signal that makes birds avoid it, something only they can hear, but the point isn't about the birds",
            "Yeah, that would be a good idea.",

            "Yes, the article sure was.  But apparently Indonesia cuts down forests to grow palm trees to make palm oil.  But the palm oil industry is apparently terrible for the environment in all sorts of ways.",

            "But I do think it underscores one challenge we have in these global issues.  Different countries/cultures/economies see the world very differently.  In the west, in our relative prosperity, we focus on certain things.  And in these high-population, low-wealth countries, they focus on much more basic goals.  Sort of like a Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs thing.  The point is, getting everyone to go along with some worldwide issue like reducing greenhouse gases, is extremely difficult if not impossible.",

            "Yeah I really know practically nothing about them.  The estimate of how many were dying was really vague, like a very wide range.  I reckon it is hard for them to even know exactly the impact they are having.",
            "That's the other thing with all these issues.  I admit I'm ignorant, but I'm also not sure if I can even trust information and data we get, or for sources to really represent the whole picture.  Everything is so political and narrow.  And we're just bombarded with so many issues and opinions these days.  At some point you just throw up your hands and say, I'm not sure what to think.",
            "Yeah totally, that is so very true.  And everyone has a bias or a political agenda they are trying to promote, and you can distort facts to sway things a certain way with almost anything.",
            "That's the thing about the internet.  I think people feel they're MORE informed these days, but I'm not sure it's the opposite.  There's just too much information.  I don't think our brains are designed to handle so much.  We can make sense of what we can touch (figuratively) but trying to comprehend this incomprehensibly large planet?  I think it's too much.",
            "Yeah exactly!  And we all have our biases and seek out information that confirms the things we believe and ignore other info.",
            "Yes, I admit that I'm as guilty as anyone.  I cherry pick opinions and stories that corroborate my beliefs.",
            "Yeah I totally do too.  And go to my favorite news sources which are biased towards my beliefs.  Well I must go, it has been a pleasure speaking with you and I hope you enjoy your day.  bye",

They have a very difficult job and are threatened constantly and have to make snap decisions sometimes.  This was not a racial thing.  The officer himself was African American.  So the reaction of the community was entirely inappropriate to me.  They LOOTED a Hornets store!!!  What on earth.",

            "This is certainly a contentious issue.",
            "It is very much. I am afraid we're going to keep seeing it. However, I feel we are only getting half the story and we're only making national headlines about cops shooting people and not people shooting cops.",
            "Yes, I like to say that just because a story is true, doesn't make it representative of the country as a whole.  If the news decided to run stories about kidnappings, they could very easily have the country go into a panic over that.  We get just the slightest sliver of a glimpse of the country through the news, and it skews our perspective.",
            "I totally agree. We tend to see the media picking and choosing what they focus on. We don't even get a fair representation of happenings. Instead, we get a skewed view to press a political hot button and not giving a fair understanding of the incidents.",
            "Right.  A narrative gets created and information either adds to it or gets disregarded.  For example, blacks are actually killed less often by police than whites based on encounter rates, but that piece of data has no place in politically-charged inflammatory subjects like this one.  Only emotions and strawmen do.",
            "I couldn't agree more. Just like more blacks kill one another than are shot by cops, but we make it out as if the only people killing black people are cops. I wish we would get a better representation of facts in the media to educate people. That was how media was supposed to work. These days it seems more like they simply want to grab headlines and push political agendas.",
            "Yeah, I think it's pretty sad.  The other thing I say to people is to use their own experiences to guide their beliefs more than stuff they see on screens.  How many hundreds of thousands of POSITIVE, PRODUCTIVE, LEGAL, and APPROPRIATE police encounters occur each day for every one that goes horribly wrong?  Again, a cop might shoot and murder an innocent civilian, but that's not our reality.  The event might be the truth.  But it's not representative of the true state of the nation and what the vast, vast, vast majority of people experience in their lives instead of on screens.",
            "I couldn't have said it better myself. We tend to take the extreme cases that make the headlines and make that the normal reality when it is far from the truth. I just recently saw a video of a black man with a knife. He was ordered to drop it and continued to advance on the cop. The man was shot several times, went down and then jumped back up. He attacked a second officer before he was finally taken down. That video didn't make headlines to show how often cops have little choice but to defend themselves.",
            "Yeah, precisely.  I also ask myself in these issues, how much danger do we expect these cops to put themselves in?  How close to certain death do we expect them to come before they're allowed to defend themselves?  I'm sorry but it's not hard to get a cop not to abuse you: do what he says.  They don't have any more desire to get violent than you do.",
            "I've said the same thing many times myself. I've had interactions with cops and never had any violence or threat of violence. If an officer asks you to do something, do it! That's what I was taught growing up. Respect authority figures. Instead, today everyone thinks they don't have to listen to anyone. They don't respect authority. They want to live stream it and get reactions on social media.",
            "Yes, that's the question I want answered.  It's not, \"Why are people getting shot by police?\"  It's, \"Why is there a generation of people, and apparently predominantly blacks, who don't think they have to respect the law and law enforcement?\"",
            "I'm afraid it's what they are being taught by parents, social media and even music. They are told people are, \"out to get them\" and so they don't have to listen to anyone -- not just cops, but teachers and anyone in authority. It's a sad state of affairs I'm afraid.",
            "Yes, I think that teachers and principals have largely abdicated their authority and influence.  Heck, even parents, who often seem more intent on being friends than authority figures to their children.",
            "Well we don't enforce any rules on children anymore. We don't punish them. We give them time outs, as if that will teach them anything. I got spanked a few times growing up and I learned how to behave. Yes, some children were abused, but the majority of parents used spanking properly and taught children how to behave. Now, kids threaten to call CPS on parents if they don't get their way.",
            "Yes, I think it's sad an ironic.  I often wonder how a generation of people who were spanked but couldn't possibly believe they were abused, could go on to think spanking is so wrong.  I have a theory but it'd take too long to discuss here.  Just a weird irony, in my opinion.",
            "It is. It's like everything in society now, though. We have gone to the extreme to avoid upsetting anyone or offending anyone. Doesn't anymore remember the old saying, \"You can't please all of the people, all of the time!\" Suddenly, everyone thinks they get to always have their way no matter what because otherwise, I'm offended!",
            "Yeah, it's just crazy.  Even the people who believe that's how it should be can't help offending people.  There's always someone who's going to be offended.  We should be teaching people to be responsible and resilient, not to see themselves as victims.",
            "It's back to that everyone get's a trophy theory. We suddenly can't disappoint anyone. Life is full of disappointment. We can't always have our own way. We're supposed to live by the majority rules theory. However, even in politics we see people forget that. Instead, don't like the president, then refuse to accept him. It's crazy. I've voted for plenty of people that didn't win elections but still respected those that did.",
            "Absolutely.  And the ultimate irony is that by trying to make everyone's life struggle-free, we increase their struggles by making everyone less capable of dealing with them.  We know it's unhealthy and unproductive to treat kids like this, make them soft and feeble.  It's not just silly, it's actually detrimental to the people we're trying to protect.",
            "Exactly! Instead of letting them learn when they're young and the disappointments are more minor that they can survive not always getting what they want. We let them grow up thinking everything should go their way. Then suddenly, they don't get into the college they want or get the job they want and they can't deal with it.",
            "Yeah, it's a bizarre tack we've taken and I wonder when it or if we'll change course.  Anyway, it was great talking with you.  I really enjoyed it.  Hope you have a great day.  bye",
            "Was great chatting with you as well. Enjoy your day. goodbye"

            "True. Now, I believe that there are way more good police than bad, but it's obvious that some people are attracted to police work because it gives them a gun and the license to use it in public without fear of retribution",
            "I agree that there are good police. I think they should be held to a high standard",
            "Yes. Really, again, these are just symptoms though. Most of these social conflicts are really just proxies for the real problem, which is wealth disparity, which leads to scapegoating",
            "Yeah, most super rich people do not care what happens to people no matter what their race is.",
            "Yeah, or rather they only care so far as it keeps them entrenched in the 1%",
            "I always wonder when enough money is enough.",
            "Well, it's tough, because competition and profit fuels development, but it's a fact that wages have been stagnate (or even dropped against the value of the dollar) since the mid-90s",
            "Jeff Bezos could pay more, but he rather see the fake number go up in his bank account.",

            "Do you think all this class,race is just part of the human condition?",
            "That's an interesting question. Probably. I often say that if you want to know what humanity is about, just look around at what we do. We are what we do. But, a lot of it is due to developing in a climate of scarcity, where there is the perception that there are not enough to go around (which really should not be true anymore).",
            "I agree. I think people are just scared to let their guard down because they do not want to lose what they have.",
            "Yes. It's tough. But, what is going to happen in 20 years when automation, robotics, and AI eliminates A LOT of jobs. WE're already nearing a tipping point. What happens when there are simply not enough jobs for people anymore?",
            "Hopefully universal basic income.",
            "Yes, that makes a lot of sense. Basically, a form of socialism, but it's hard to get there without a real economic collapse. As long as it functions somewhat, then we're stuck with the current economic model, which means more racial scapegoating and more violence.",

            "The government has long stopped working in the interest of the common man.",
            "True, but it's not just the government, it's everything, all of it. The whole structure and processes of society. It's a massive problem that will only be solved if we reach some crisis that necessitates huge change.",
            "Climate change or an asteroid.",
            "Yes, something at that level. People won't change unless their comfort is threatened. It doesn't have to be existential, but big enough to rattle everyone.",
            "Do you think police should be enforcing laws dealing with what an adult does with their own body?",
            "Well, I think there are way too many laws governing personal behavior. Most things that do not directly harm others should be legal. Abortion. Suicide. Gambling. Prostitution. Some drugs. Legalize, regulate and tax. The problem isn't the act themselves, it's the criminality, which breeds abuse and exploitation, because where can you turn if you know that what you're doing could get you locked up?",
            "I can see how see how some women can be forced into prostitution. I believe all drugs should be legal. I would hate for one of my children to overdose, but I would also hate for one of my children to die from a heart attack from eating Big Macs all day which is not illegal.",
            "Yes, that's right. Our society shouldn't punish people for making what others would deem to be a mistake. It should be more forgiving and permissive. Drug addition should not be a criminal matter - it should be viewed as a public health matter.",
            "Do you think we should make police less militarized?",
            "Probably, but I also think that there should be way more police. And, yeah, the role of police should shift away from 'catching bad guys' to supporting communities.",
            "Like back in the day when they knew the people's names in the community.",
            "Yes, exactly - I also think that police should live in the precincts they work in.",
            "I agree with that.",
            "Well, ti was really cool chatting with you. I don't know if we solved any of society's problems, but it was fun. goodbye",

            "So you're saying the oil people should move the pipeline, or determine some other means of remedy?",
            "I just think that they might be able to figure something out. They probably have a lot more resources and money.",

            "Yeah, like the MAGA hat kid story",
            "Exactly.  I hate to get like this, but I don't trust a word from the media anymore.  They'll frame anything to get the point across that they want to.",
            "Totally agreed! And I had not read the article closely enough. I thought the Native Americans were protesting themselves. I didn't realize they were there with the environmental activists.",
            "Yeah I don't remember verbatim, but that's basically what was said.  \"Around 150 Native Americans and protestors\", or something like that.  It reminds me of when there was that huge backlash against the Washington Redskins, and that name being derogatory.  But over 95% of Native Americans polled said they didn't care, and many schools in reserves were named the Redskins... Just interest groups deciding to be upset about something.",
            "If that is the case though, even more sad for the Native Americans that are being used by the activists and getting hurt in the protests.",
            "True.  Either way you look at it, Native Americans have been getting shit on in this country for like 500 years.",
            "So true.",
            "I guess with that being said, maybe I am more in favor of them changing the pipeline somehow.  Even if there is just a small chance of leaking, maybe the NA's have been f'd with enough.",
            "If there is a way to do it and avoid going through that land, that might be the best thing to do.",
            "Yeah.  I wonder if any of the oil bigwigs have discussed that at all, or if they're just planning on ompletly muscling these people, knowing they have the support of the Government.",
            "I would think the protests might have them thinking a little about it at least. But I think it said the land was owned by the federal government, but the Native Americans thought they had some right to it because of some treaty.",
            "If I remember correctly, the land itself is owned by the government, but the problem would be if the the pipeline burst.  If that happened, oil would seep into the groundwater, and pollute the (sacred) lake that the NA's use.",
            "That makes sense. It seems that there should be a way to make it safe so that the Native Americans are ok with it. And it could help them get jobs too.",

            "I thought about this in a while. Really makes you think about all the tragedies that newer stuff just pushes out of the way",
            "Yes, we have short memories now.  One tragedy or threat or whatever replaces another with great speed.",
            "i thnk that we're just bombarded with new information about everything that it just becomes a list ofstuff that's horrible after a while",
            "Yes, I worry at what point we collectively stop caring.  Is the world a better place because I learn about some school bus that crashes in some part of the world I know nothing about?  That sounds callous but the world is incomprehensibly large.  We can't concern ourselves with the fate of all 7 billion people.",
            "callus is right. The more we go on learning of this stuff, it builds up like a callus, or it eats so far into you. bad to say, but it feels like if a certain number of people don't get murdered, then its not worth my attention. that's horrible",
            "One thing in the story that stuck out to me was the band that played the show that got attacked.  I'd feel awful for the rest of my life if that had been my band.  People came to MY show.  I WANTED them to come to MY show.  And they ended up dead or traumatized because of it.  I'd feel devastated by that.",
            "yeah. i didn't even consider that. they were there to see them. the reason for showing up. Damn.",
            "The response of France also sounded a lot like a U.S. response to a similar event.  The government claims more power to insure safety.  Backlash against Muslims increases for a time.  People mourn.  It could have been America after 9/11.  My point is, people are largely people, even though other countries like to paint the U.S. as different.  Of course it is in ways, but we're also just all people.",
            "stuff gets taken advantage of. People's lives get turned into politcal tools by the charasmatic sociopaths who govern us. Its in a lot of people's interest to drive us apart. It's like in in prince machevelia or somehting.",
            "Yeah, I agree.  There's a lot of that.  Apropos your original point, I sort of can't remember the last time a Western country had one of these events.  (I'm not including the \"domestic terrorism\" of mass shootings in the U.S.)  I wonder if we're due, or if it's a sign the terrorists are losing or we're just getting really capable at preventing this stuff.",
            "boston bombing. somehting like that. It gets scary to see the reaction of militarized force to thos ehtings. I don't want to live in a country like that. But I don't know about being due, I don't think this stuff happens a lot of the time, and when it does it isn't preventable even more of the time, it's just the response the draconia militarization that comes aftwerward creating the illusion of safety",
            "I was in Washington D.C. after 9/11.  It was always eerie driving past the Pentagon and other areas and seeing humvees with guided missiles pointing to the sky.",
            "people seem so eager to lose that freedom if you pretend they're safe. Terrorism in america, when we're not talking about mass shooters is nearly nonexistent, but we still need tanks in the street for some reason.",
            "Yeah, I find with a lot of these issues that we lose perspective.  The world becomes so small when we distill it down to extreme events and watch it on a screen.  But the world is incomprehensibly large.  This country is.  A state is, even a city.  I'm sure right now a lot of parents are sincerely worried about sending their kids to school.  The reality is that they're more likely to win the lottery than ever experience someone they love getting killed in a mass shooting.",
            "exactly. But fear is a great manipulator. People are taken advantage of, told constantly that they're going to be in danger so they can watch more tv, or buy whatever, or vote a certain way, and it just creates chaos.",
            "Yeah, I'm not sure what the solution is, or even an improvement.  We seem hell-bent on running towards a world of greater and greater manipulation.  We joke about \"1984\" and that type of dystopia and yet we can't put down our phones.",
            "its hard for a lot of people, i understand that. You get like postive rewards, doepamine or whatever in a constant rush by seeing whats on your phone. It all goes hand in hand, tools of addiction, manipulation, fear. You don't want to trust anyone, everyone's a serial killer, or a rapist pedophile, or a terrorist, and if you talk about love or empathy, or trust, you're a weak retard who lives in a fantasy world. I can change myself, but by and large this is the way people are being shaped as a whole. I feel despondent or whatever.",
            "Yeah, it's hard.  But I think that feeling of despondency is probably shared by many people, in various ways and for various reasons.  We see too much of the world now.  We recognize our own futility and insignificance and impotence more than ever.  I think our brains are designed to live in smaller worlds, worlds we feel in more control of.",
            "i thinkthat's true",
            "I agree.  I also think what I said is true.  Maybe.",
            "this is a good chat, but we're in too deep and my repoies are taking up too much time. You seem like a classy individual, thought. bye",

I'm not saying the guy needed to kill it, but I find it wholly unacceptable to expose people to uncontrolled dogs, especially in environments where they're not allowed to be off their leashes.",

I thought the most peculiar sentence in the article was when they said they walked by the two dog owners and one of the people (presumably the wife) apologized for their loss.  That just seemed wildly strange and ironice.",
            "Sounds like a person going through the motions of saying somehting they don't mean, ust to be polite or whatever.",
            "Absolutely.  I think that's right.  But it's so unbelievable, why bother to even say it.  I'm sort of surprised the dog owner didn't lose her mind.  Maybe she was scared of getting shot herself.  And she was also focused on her dying dog, of course.",

The woman's first instinct was not to check on her child, who was still under the car, but to bang on the guy's windows to complain.  I thought that was interesting.",
            "I think getting mad is a normal reaction. If you can blame someone for somehting, then its like it takes the burden off of you somehow, it's like you don't have to be in control, or take resposibility if you can just blame it all on someone else, even if it was there fault or whatever.",
            "I agree, but I would have thought her motherly instinct would have been to focus on the child first.  Apparently not.",
            "if you're not a in control, take charge type, you can just say look at what you did, you did something wrong, you fix it. You pay for it, because its beyond my control.",

            "In my opinion, the man was totally within his rights.  That dog should have been on a leash plus the owner failed to restrain it when it attacked him.  I'm fed up with people being inconsiderate of others and having unleashed dogs in public places that endanger the safety of others.  What if it had been a child?",
            "Yeah, I do agree that it is annoying when people don't follow the rules and just let their unleashed and very bad dogs in a park. I have left parks before because I have 2 small children and do not want unleashed dogs around them",
            "Same here.  I have three small children and a teen and I don't want aggressive unleashed dogs around any of them.  Not to mention, and this is less serious, but we had to leave a park just recently bc someone's dog was pooping everywhere and they were just leaving it.  My toddlers could crawl into that and get it on their hands.  Disgusting.  So inconsiderate.",
            "Yes, I have a 6 year old and a 1 year old, its enough having to watch them around water since we live by the beach. People just let their dogs go unleashed all the time and then they run towards my children and you don't know if these dogs are up to date on their vaccinations either",
            "Oh yeah, that's totally unacceptable.  I just feel like people should be more considerate about their pets and other people.  Just have them on a leash and clean up their waste, plus take them into non-trafficked areas when they need to go.  The article also doesn't even mention the breed of the dog, I don't think, not that it really matters.  It was uncool regardless.",
            "I looked up the article and it was a very big black lab. Also the dog was dancing around the man, so it was going to attack him",
            "Yeah, I would have been scared myself.  You just never know with a dog.  I read things in the paper all the time about attacks.  My parents have some ridiculous aggressive dog and we don't even go to their house anymore because of it.",
            "I have a German Shepard, she is so sweet and is scared of her own shadow but she is never allowed to be alone with the kids. My in laws have 3 (very bad) dogs and they scare me and they are a forth of the size as my dog",
            "Theirs is a specially trained attack Czech german shepherd.  It aggressively barks at anyone who approaches it (that is not them) and has issues.  It recently chewed up the wiring on its crate so badly that its teeth were broken.",
            "Yea that is terrifying. Police dogs are known to attack children too, just because they are trained to kill basically",
            "Yeah exactly, and that's exactly what this dog is.  It has really damaged our relationship because we can't bring our kids around them anymore.  My sister doesn't even have kids and she doesn't feel comfortable going over there either.  Crazy.  Picking a dog over family.",
            "Yep, as soon as my in laws got their last dog they don't even baby sit anymore and just go googly eyes over a silly dog, kind of weird. They should want to see the grand babies",
            "yeah exactly!  it's insulting.  But anyway, it is what it is.",
            "It is! I would think when I have grand children I would want to see them as much as possible. I was reading up and dog people are freaking out that the guy didn't get charges pressed against him. Face palm",
            "Oh I bet they are outraged!!  I was totally expecting to get a dog person defending the man with this HIT and dreading the ensuing conversation.  I would want to see my grandchildren and would easily re-home any pet that was standing in the way of that.",
            "Well when i first read it i thought the dog was just playing around and the guy was just shooting the dog because he had a few screws loose but then i looked up the article somewhere else",
            "that was a good idea.  I guess I am already slightly biased against dogs bc of the issue with my parents, plus I am always reading about dogs that killed some innocent child or baby.  It breaks my heart.  I know dogs make great pets for some people and I support that but just be responsible and considierate.",
            "Yea I am kind of in the middle, I know some people are violent against dogs for no reason and that is not acceptable but the dog was definitively going to attack that man.",
            "I agree with you that if it is for no reason that is unacceptable.  It is also tragic to read about inncoent dogs being abused or hurt by cruel sick people.  Well thank you for sharing your thoughts with me, I have enjoyed our conversation.  Have a great day.  goodbye",
            "Thank you, you too!",
            "thank you!  I think you have to type in goodbye",

            "even with the best of intentions like here, we just end up doing more bad than good",
            "I thought the end of the article was interesting.  The scientist was saying, \"We don't want to discourage people from putting in garden ponds, but just be careful about what you put in them.\"  And it's like, is there a problem or not?  Because of this is a problem I don't think we can be telling people they can do it if they want, they just need to be responsible.  That will engender zero change.",
            "true, can't really expect a normal person to know that a garden pond he made few weeks ago had damaged frog population in his area. definitely need to educate people more on these things",

            "Yeah, I don't mind frogs.  I see them when I go for walks at night and they sometimes scare me because they look like rocks on the road and then they shockingly start moving.  But of course they're just frogs.",

            "Yeah, I think we forget that we're part of the whole natural world and are subject to all these things as well.  This is what happens to species.  They're exposed to new things and they adapt or die.  We're better at adapting to things, but we're still part of that system.",
            "And we are mostly running the system but sometimes it just feels that we can never won, there is always some new virus or bacteria that nature throws at us and we start from ground zero again and again",
            "Yeah, there will always be something that crops up and threatens us.  And at the same time we're worried about other species too.  We've certainly got a lot of balls in the air.",
            "Someone I know recently got sick with one of those superbugs and barely survived. I keep thinking to what will be the future like when those become the norm than the exceptions in hospitals",

So I just have no idea what the likelihood of any of these bugs wiping out major portions of the population are, like Spanish flu and the plague once did.",
            "Probably very low since we do have some defense even for those. Plagues of old time were just so bad and humans helpless as they did not understood they causes of what was happening and why",

I felt sad for the frogs but honestly I didn't feel an overwhelming heartbreak or anything.  In general, the ponds seem to be a positive thing for wildlife.",
            "Yeah definitely, and it is a good thing that people are more interesting in helping to preserve wildlife with these man made ponds but the side effects of it are upsetting. The scientific community definitely needs to let people know before more of the population gets infected though.",
            "Yes I totally agree with you.  LIke they need to put this info out there at shops that carry the items to stock these ponds and in other sources where people can easily find them.  To protect the frogs and the spread of these diseases",

            "yeah exactly!  and I think they mentioned the ornamental fish too.  Did it say it was spreading to them?  Either way, people obviously aren't thinking this stuff through as well as they should.",
            "I know it mentioned that the disease did not start organically or it did not start in the UK. And for sure but can like the average person really think about something like that happening, i feel like the issue is more so about people not being informed enough when they want to do something like this.",
            "yeah, so the key would be more education?  getting people, consumers especially, the information they need to make appropriate choices and protect the species",
            "Yeah maybe, building a pond is a pretty big undertaking so at some point during the process somebody should be informing them or giving them the info they need into what they are doing and the harm they could be causing right.",
            "Yeah I totally agree.  Whose responsibility do you think it should be to inform people, or do you think the people themselves should be responsible for looking up the information?",
            "I think they should definitely get some of the info themselves but i think the shops are also a big part of where they should get the info from.",
            "Yes I agree the shops should be a main source.  They're the ones profiting from this whole thing too",
            "Exactly, it feels like at some point anyone who wants to build a pond they should come into contact with someone who should be knowledgeable about the current issues and inform them. Maybe require some form of education before you can own something like this?",
            "Yeah like a contiuing ed class, it could be offered online",
            "Yeah that would be for the best. That way people know the current issues and can help protect the environment. Sadly it doesn't completely solve the issue but it is a step in the right direction",
            "Yes I'd like to think it would at least help a little and make a difference",
            "For sure it would, i just hope that the UK amphibian population is able to build itself back up once more immune frogs start reproducing.",

            "Your right, I do not think it will change either.",
            "I'm afraid that it's also become such a contentious issue that it's hard to even trust allegations anymore when they're in the political sphere.  Which is very sad for people who do experience actual harassment.",
            "It is hard but when you hear somebody say grab them by the P, it is not hard to see that person actually doing that.",
            "Sure, although the person you're referring to also makes a lot of boasts and claims that are not true, so who's to say that wasn't just him bragging.  I'm just saying that every time there's a false allegation, and there are, it undermines the credibility of every single woman who legitimately experiences it.",
            "I agree that some woman make false allegations, but I do not think it is the majority.",
            "I agree, I think most allegations have some truth.  But I also think we've gotten hysterical about this stuff, so when someone says, \"I was sexually harassed,\" or even \"assaulted,\" I don't know what that means.  I think that's unfortunate too.",
            "It is the climate we live in today. Some of the claims you say, wait a minute that does not sound right, but we should still listen.",
            "The other thing about these issues is that we just seem to cycle through them and then lose interest and go onto something else.  Sexual harassment, blacks getting shot by cops, mass shooting, something Trump has done, North Korea or Russia or China, and then back to someone being sexually harassed.  It's just weird how quickly these issues come and go and then come back again, seemingly with no progress, just more ire.",
            "Yeah all of these issues need to be addressed in the proper manner. The world is so fast paced that most people do not have time to worry about issues that do not effect them.",

            "I think bringing these issues to the light are helping some people. I think it is better than not thinking about them or hiding them.",
            "Certainly could be.  Do you think the net effect of the metoo stuff (apropos this article) has been positive?",

            "I think it's a mixed bag.  I think the goal of having women not sexually harassed and assaulted is good and I agree some people are probably thinking about their behavior or even changing it now.  But I think the general relationship between men and women is strained and growing contentious.  I'm not sure how to address some of these issues without that happening, unfortunately.  But I think that, at times, there is a definite \"men versus women\" mentality growing in the country and world, and, at least in the short term, it's harmful in ways.  Is the end result worth it?  Maybe. But it's still an issue, I think.",
            "I think there is a small group of women who think it is us vs them. I have three daughters, a mother, female coworkers and friends. I can empathize with them without thinking that I'm being judged as a man",

            "Do you know anyone who's been part of it?",
            "Yes, one of my sisters was date raped at a party while she was in college and she is just know talking about it. I always wonder why women wait to say something, but I have never been in their shoes.",
            "I'm not surprised they don't report it.  I'm sure there's a lot of fear and shame involved.  I do think it's an impediment to this issue being handled properly though.  If men are going to be held accountable, accusations can't come 30 years later.",
            "I agree with you.",
            "Any other thoughts on this issue?  I'm mostly tapped out, I think.",

            "Well I probably have an unpopular opinion about this but it's how I feel.  I think the #metoo movement has gone too far honestly.  I find a lot of these allegations highly questionable and I'm skeptical.  In this case, her roommates from the time period do recall her mentioning it supposedly so there seems to be some validity there.  But you just never really k now with these things, especially when it's brought up twenty years later.  Seems like a lot of women just do this for attention or whatever weird reasons they might have.",
            "In this case in particular, it's something she mentioned before so that makes it more likely to be true I think. It's really difficult because it's not like it's easy to prove things like this.",
            "Yeah totally.  It comes down to a \"he says, she says\" in so many cases.  I agree that the fact that she mentioned it at the time lends some credibility to the story.  I just feel like so many men have been unfairly crucified by this whole movement.",
            "In some cases maybe. Or maybe more women are just speaking up when they were afraid to before, since it's so hard to prove one way or the other.",
            "I would guess a little bit of both, but it could also be that more women are wanting to fabricate things and get int he spotlight bc they see it happening with other women",
            "I guess it's hard to imagine anyone would want to be recognized for something like that. I mean you never know, I guess. What do you think a woman should do if she's been a victim but has no proof? It's pretty easy to just grab or touch someone without anyone else seeing",
            "I find it very easy to believe someone would want to be recognized for that.  People will do anything for attention.  Look at reality TV and social media.  I think people should report things when they happen, not 20 years later.",
            "Sure, that would be helpful but even then if you have no proof it doesn't really matter if it just happened does it? It could still be seen as a ploy for attention or an attempt to bring someone down. Or there could be shame involved too. Not everyone is just out to get attention. Some victims are too ashamed to say anything.",
            "Yep I agree, but the ones who are fabricating it and doing it for attention are ruining it for the genuine victims",
            "I suppose so. But we can't really punish women for coming forward just because they don't have proof.",
            "No, you can't punish them, but honestly in my opinion you can't treat a man as though he's guilty unless there is proof.  But unfortunately, once these people make their allegations the public basically treats the person as though they are guilty and their life is destroyed, and often their career and the lives of their family members.  So to me it is just very sad.  And it scares me for my sons.  My husband doesn't even want to be around women at work bc he is scared someone might make up some allegation.  THAT is a hostile environment and unfair to men.",
            "That's true, there needs to be proof before punishment. Anyone who is fired for something like that without proof should be able to sue for wrongful termination.",
            "Yes they should.  But I do understand what you're saying about the true victims and the predicament they are in.  I Just think it's a very sad situation for everyone and it's distressing that this is an issue in our society now.",
            "It is definitely a difficult situation.",
            "Yes really without any good solution.  People would have to constantly be wearing body cameras to have definitive proof one way or the other, which is absurd.",
            "Yep. Or companies would have to start putting cameras up everywhere which is also ridiculous. We just need to teach our children how to handle these situations and hope for the best.",
            "Yeah, no doubt.  Maybe the next generation can see some improvement if parents work to teach them better when they are young.  I don't know.",

            "Honestly, I'm sure it sounds insensitive, but I'm tired of these.",
            "I agree, who knows if it really happened or if this is just political.",
            "Yeah and at this point, particularly after the Smollet, and Kavanaugh case, I just tend to doubt the accuser more.  Especially when the accusations are dated by decades.",
            "Exactly, the timing is always very suspicious.",
            "I understand it form the other perspective too, maybe the name, such as Kavanaugh, becomes so huge in the news, that it infuriates you and you feel like you have to say something. I still just don't buy it though.",
            "Yeah, I can see that too. But it's not like Clarence Thomas just became a big thing recently.",
            "Yeah.  A lot of this supreme court stuff, I think the democrats saw the opportunity for the gop to take a massive majority in the court, and decided they had to take drastic efforts to curb that.  They were too eager to push this narrative, even though the evidence wasn't there.",
            "I think these things must really bother people who have been actually attacked / raped... She says he cupped his hand over her butt. If that happened to me, I would probably forget about it by the next day.",
            "Seriously.  Ok, this might be a little off the wall, but I think this is the human evolution catching up to society.  It used to be that man protected and hunted, women took care of kids, and were prized for their looks and maternal instincts.  Nowadays, woman have caught up to men in their working ability.  Men have to learn that women aren't their property anymore, and this is a dynamic that might take time to set in with the elitely wealthy.",
            "If women and men are completely equal. I think men wouldn't really think twice about a women touching their butt. And I don't think 20 that they would be going public about it 20 years later.",
            "Lol.  Every man's wildest fantasy includes a woman touching his butt unanounced.  But no, I don't think men and women are necessariliy equal in abilities and talents, I'm not one of those people.",
            "Too funny! If he did intentionally cup his hand over her butt 20 years ago, would there be anything legally to do about it anyway?",
            "I would assume only in the court of public opinion.  There would be a push to take away his seat.  Which is just another reason to think this was politially motivated.",
            "The world is a scary place. I feel for my kids having to grow up in this environment.",
            "Yeah I think the same thing sometime.  However, when you really think about it, the world could go completely south in the next few years, and still be leaps and bounds better than it was 200/500/1000 years ago.",
            "That's a good way to look at it!",
            "Lol, I do however doubt humanity is going to be around for another thousand years.  I'm sure that we're going to find some way to eff things up in the next century or two.",
            "I think about that all of the time. When you do look at how much it's changed from even just 200 years ago. I wonder how long it can keep going.",
            "yeah, I remember hearing couple years ago about how we've basically reached the limit that we can on processor speed or storage or something like that.  I wonder when that kind of thing will start to hit our other technologies.",
            "Yeah, who knows. I can't imagine the future progressing as quickly as it has over the past 100 years.",
            "Yeah it's like we had the industrial revolution, and maybe now we're nearing the end of the technological revolution.  But who knows...",
            "Great conversation! Went from butt touching to the end of technological revolution! Nice talking to you!",
            "lol yeah good talk. bye",

            "Yes, it's definitely a problem.  I see on TV some ad saying that \"the first survivor of Alzheimer's is alive today,\" or something like that.  So maybe cures for some of these brain diseases are around the corner.",

            "Exactly, I was thinking about that some time ago, it's like children but when we deal with children we do so with hope that they will learn and growup but there is no hope for those old patients",
            "I think there's probably already a shortage of these types of workers, and it will only get worse going forward.  Old folks homes and that type of thing are a massive industry now.  We used to just put our elderly in the attic.",
            "It's definitely going to be a bigger problem as people live longer and longer.",
            "Back to this story, it's still nice to see that there's help out there in various forms.  Police get a bad rap these days but they still do plenty to help people.  And we focus on negative events and people, but there's still no shortage of people willing to help others.  We still have \"communities\" whether we recognize it often or not.",
            "Police really have a difficult job, you can do 1000's of such acts in your career but what will be remembered is one less than perfect act. I just hope that the lady in this story gets the help she obviously needs after her rescue",

            "yeah its obvious she has mental problems",
            "I saw that she was almost seventy.  In my line of work, you see a lot dementia or alzheimers patients tht get out of their house and wander.",
            "yeah it happens to some people at that age which begs the question who was taking care of her",
            "Yeah, it's hard to blame the caretaker though.  There's a lot of people out there who are afraid of homes, and think they can take care of their spouse in their later years.  Gets difficult, and next thing you know George snuck his way out of the house while you were taking a shower.",
            "Surely someone will step up",
            "There's a lot of people without family out there, and even then, caring for a mentally ill older patient can be incredibly difficult and time consuming.",

            "Lol do you have any experience with this? Do you have any idea how expensive home health care nurses are?  Most people cannot afford those services, and even if you can, most home health care only show up for an hour a day.  To pay for help to watch your parent full time, while you work full time, would be pointless.",
            "well I guess thats a price I'm willing to pay for my parents who took care of my annoying self as a child even though I was not always nice to them. There is more than just health care nurses out there lol.",
            "Look, this isn't even about caring for a parent, this is about caring for a parent, who also wants to wake up at 2 am, and head to the grocery store that doens't exist.  I'm aware that you think you've got it all figured out, but I can assure you, life with a spouse who has dementia is tougher than you think.",
            "trust me I'm currently caring for kids that were taken from my sister because of her mental problems. I am now taking care of them as seen by the state. I am not with them 24/7 and I find ways to look after them and make sure their homework is done on time. Even the bad child who was out until 4 am when he was under my sisters care doesn't sneak out now. I am not new to caring for people. Someone with dementia is a whole other ballgame. No one has it all figured out, its just that caring for loved ones is not that difficult. Maybe we were raised differently.",
            "I'm not saying that you can't care for people, I just think blaming the caretakers for a sick old person getting out is kind of jumping the gun.",
            "if you know someone you are looking after has dementia you raise you level of care. You install alarm systems, phone apps etc. The technology is there. Ofc it wont work all the time and I am not trying to discredit your points because they are valid. But you just have to step your game up according to the circumstances",
            "Well I agree with that.",
            "I agree with many of your points as well its just if there is a will theres a way",
            "True, just remember it isn't the will of a thirty year old we're talking about here a lot, it's a seventy something year old spouse who doesn't want to stop caring for their loved one.  But I hear ya.",
            "yeah most definitely my parents are up there in age thank god they are still with me mentally.",
            "That's definitely got to be one of those diseases that really affects the kids and spouses more than the patient themselves.  I couldn't imagine my wife or parents forgetting who I was, or the memories we shared.",
            "Thats a scary thought bro. We have to be thankful everyday no one close to us has that disease and hope it stays that way.",
            "I always love reading the news that they're close to finding a cure for alzheimers.  Hope that that'll never be something I deal with.",
            "yeah we always read about these cures but to be honest they still seem far away",
            "True. I'm sure a lot of them are just clickbait.",
            "Yeah these sites that clickbait these cures need to be removed. I can't imagine getting my hopes up if my wife had dementia only to click on it and see it was nothing. Thats playing with peoples emotions a little too much. Anyway, this has been the best talk I've had on one of these hits brother. I respect you very much for that. Hope the rest of your day goes well. bye",

            "I think that even though the article was from 2016 it is still very relevant. I also thought it quite morbid that no accounts of rescue were mentioned. These people are drowning along well trafficked routes through the Mediterranean and no one can be bothered to help? At all?",
            "I agree, what I found was really terrible was that thousands of people drowned in the Medaterain, and goverments arnt doing anything to stop that from happening",
            "I wonder how many of the one million refugees Merkel promised to harbor actually made it to Germany.",
            "That a good question. This article was a little hard to take it all in, I wish they would of made it a bit more readable because there was so MUCH important information concerning so many countries in the word.",
            "Yeah, it was a little discursive. One minute were talking about smugglers, then were on to drownings and finally some war reporting. It would have scanned better emotionally with better focus.",
            "Indeed, Perhaps they can segment it better so they can make three articles out of this focusing on different countries concerning smugglers, that would certainly help... again there was SO much information it was hard to tak in all of it..",
            "Also, smugglers barely got a mention in passing. What kind of smugglers were they? Where are they from? That was a lead to nowhere.",
            "Yes and they mention that goverments are just turning a blind eye -- does that mean all countries? they're just not really clear.",
            "Now am wondering which journalist, and more importantly, which journal of opinion, would run such a slap dash article.",
            "I'm not sure, but I remember that this was an article from CNN, or so it stated as a resource at the very beginning -- CNN is ver impartial though, and a lot of what was in it seemed a bit emotional, and not detached factual, I hope that sounded right! :)",
            "Wow, you really paid your dues in attention. I don't watch/read much CNN. You have any ideas on how to deal with integration of all these refugees into western society?",
            "Thank you! CNN was in parenthesizes before the first sentence. I wish I had a solution, but I think that if more goverments got involved in the countries it was effecting, perhaps it would help. Maybe pursuing the matter more through the UN.",
            "I wonder about the UN's effectiveness sometimes. I'd like to see some numbers on how these people are being settled.",
            "That is a very interesting point. I know that the UN typicly will get involved, but it is a process...and the effectiveness it has usually relies on the international help of other countries involvements.",
            "Not just international help, but international agreement on the correct course of action, the place has to be a hornets nest.",
            "I wish there was a good way to solve these issues. I'm not the best when it comes to issues, I try to keep up with news, but these poor people that are just trying to get away from war in their county, and theirs little to no help.",
            "Right, it's not like anyone wants to leave their home. They are forced from the houses of their father's and then drown in the ocean alone and afraid. Jeez.. thanks for chatting, bye",

But it said that a deal had been made between Greece and Turkey (I think), to limit that number, suggesting Turkey was keeping migrants from moving through their country and into Greece/Europe.  Sort of like the US is asking Mexico to prevent migrants from C. America to move through their country and into ours.  I was just curious how Turkey was accomplishing this.",

            "Yeah, but looking back at her work with the Clinton makes me wonder.",
            "She certainly didn't get out of her job with a squeaky clean reputation.",
            "How do you think that era will be looked at in history?",
            "That's a good question.  I suppose it depends on who you ask.  But it was post-Cold War and Clinton didn't do much overseas, so it was mostly domestic stuff.  Clinton scandals, domestic terrorism, and a good economy.  I guess those are the things I remember.",
            "Yeah, with all this 92 crime bill talk, makes me look at the whole group differently.",
            "What's the 92 crime bill talk?",
            "Mainly Joe Biden voting for Clinton's 92 crime bill",
            "Okay.  Do you think the crime bill was driven by malice or just ignorance?",
            "Both",
            "Hmm.  Back to Reno for a second, I wonder if her \"stiffness\" was related to her eventual Parkinson's.  I assume it was, although I don't know much about Parkinson's, at least in its early form.",
            "It could have been, my grandmother had Parkinson's and it locked up her arms and hands",
            "I thought the quote from Holder was interesting about Reno always asking what the \"right\" thing to do was, since neither of them always did the right thing.",
            "As I get older I look at all people in high positions as being human and having the same flaws as everybody else.",
            "So do you think that pretty much anyone who got to those positions would corrupt and do sketchy or even illegal things?",
            "Yes, most people look of for their best interest. I think congress both parties have sold out the American people.",
            "Yeah.  I also tend to think that the rare person who WOULD remain truly ethical and pure would never rise to the heights of national office.  I don't think they'd ever get there in the first place.  You have to be more ruthless and self-serving than that.",
            "Agreed. I think the two party system is for us the people to fight while the people at the top keep enjoying the soils",
            "Yes, it certainly seems like a rich-get-richer type system at this point.  Oh well, at least everyone, including apparently Janet Reno, eventually dies.  That's gotta be some relief.  Anyway, nice chatting with you.  Have a great day.  bye",

In the US we went to war against our \"oppressors.\"  At what point do these middle eastern populations get fed up with dictators and other oppressive groups?  The people have plenty of guns.  They can form militias too.  I'd rather go down fighting than just be executed in the street.",

            "Yes, if we're being honest I really get sick of hearing people complain about the USA.  My mom is really bad about it.  We may have our (major) problems, but honestly it doesn't even compare to some of these other places.  I must go, hope you have a great day.  goodbye",

You're putting people from an anachronistic ideological system who don't speak the language out into a culture that they are incapable of understanding. A transitional period is absolutely necessary for relocation on this scale to work.",

            "I found this article obnoxious.  What were your thoughts on it?",
            "Obnoxious in what sense?",
            "It attempted to blame an increase in hate crimes (which it later retracted, saying they were likely at the same level as they were in 2015) on Trump.",
            "Yeah, but the media's pretty good at that, aren't they?  I don't think Trump creates anger and hatred.  He might embolden it.  Maybe.  But it already exists and is a function of our society, not one man.",
            "Those are my exact sentiments.  It is a mindset that has entered society and is probably exacerbated by social media and the rapid exchange of information, ideas, hatred, and anger that is prevalent in society today.  To blame it on Trump, one person, is just absurd.",
            "I also sympathize fully with people who are furious after terrorist attacks.  I personally wouldn't go harass or assault an innocent person because of it, but I understand the feelings behind it, even if I don't condone the behavior.",
            "Yes, and there have been a large number of terrorist incidents that were perpetrated by Muslims.  So to me, that would explain why people are targeting Muslims in retaliation.  Which is not right at all, but it is the explanation for why that is happening.",
            "I guess I also feel that the notion of everyone living together peacefully and harmoniously is misguided.  There will always be winners and losers, always be some sort of \"us versus them.\"  You see it in gender issues, race issues, political issues.  I think certain majority elements in our society are waking up to this and pushing back.  And I don't blame them.",
            "You make a good point.  That is probably an idealistic notion that is not grounded in reality.  I do wish people would learn to live and let live a little bit more.  Just mind their own business and enjoy their lives.",
            "Yes, I don't want to present too cynical and callous a view.  People can form stable societies.  But our current one likes to highlight differences and perceived inequalities, and that feeds a very antagonistic culture.  I think we know too much about each other, see too much that other people have that we don't, and it creates unrealistic expectations about how the world can possibly work.  We don't all get to have what we want.  Few, or none, do",
            "Yes and social media probably feeds into that.  Not to keep blaming social media for all our problems because I certainly don't think that's the case, but I Do think it heightens the issue you are describing.  People see differences and inequalities and just have much more information than they did in the past.",
            "Yeah, don't feel bad about ripping on social media.  I think it's a real problem.  Or, as you say, it heightens all these problems.  I think it's a real problem and will be interested to see how things unfold going forward, whether people start turning away from it or they double down and more of our lives gets filtered through our screens.  The problem is it's addictive for people, among other things, and I think that makes it harder for people to decide not to use it, even when they know it makes them unhappy.",
            "Yeah it definitely becomes compulsive for people, like an integrated and critical part of their lives almost.  Something did not really happen unless it's documented on social media.  Kinda crazy to me, but whatever.  Either way, I do think it is intensifying a lot of these problems and it will definitely be interesting to see what happens over the next century.",
            "Yeah, I thought about that once.  Think about how much our minds now associated \"importance\" with seeing it on a screen.  We've been conditioned to think that way.  And I think it works the other way, too.  When we see something, we make it important by recording it.  A strange phenomenon, that something isn't important until it's digitized.",
            "It is a very strange phenomenon.  And it has happened so fast.  It's crazy to think when I was a kid the only phones we had were in the house, and the computer was basically just a very simple word processor.  My kids can't even fathom it.  We used a phone book to look up a phone number.",
            "Yeah, I was the same.  I don't even have a cell phone myself.  I'm annoyed that so few people are now in the phone book.  Some places apparently don't even have phone books anymore.",
            "Yeah I don't even know where I would get a phone book.  They don't distribute them where I live.  I have a cell phone but it stays off on a shelf unless I leave the house.  It is for emergency use when I am out.",
            "Yeah, I don't ever judge people for having a cell phone.  I just joke that \"I'm not that important,\" which has more meaning than I let on, but I mostly mean as a joke.",
            "LOL apparently I am not either.  But I am perfectly fine with that.  This is how I choose to live my life.  Well it has been a pleasure speaking with you, thank you for sharing your insights with me.  I hope you enjoy the rest of your day, goodbye",
            "For sure, great chatting with you.  I enjoyed it and appreciate your perspective.  Have a great day.  bye"

            "Seriously, its so sad that these poor kids are denied food.\\",
            "Yeah, and no matter how good of intentions the parents may have, they are just stuck in a terrible situation.",
            "Exactly, I know about 30% of the kids in my son's school are provided lunch and breakfast for almost free by the government and its not the fault of the parents its just how it goes sometimes",
            "But even if that was the case there, the kids aren't even able to get to school sometimes because they have to go stand in food lines to get food for the entire family. It's a vicious circle because they are being kept out of school so they are not getting the education that they need to eventually be able to have a better life.",
            "Yea its sad the government doesn't recognize that the children are the future and they should be provided food so that they go to school",
            "It is all just really sad, obviously everyone there must be very hungry. I would think most people would try make sure their kids were getting food before they ate it themselves.",
            "Yea the parents probably have trouble working since they are starving as well, and that probably makes it even harder to provide for their family",
            "It makes me so sad, sometimes I think I wish I could just send money to people like this but I don't really know how or if I trust organizations. What my family spends on one meal eating out would probably be life changing for people like this.",
            "Exactly, I think its basically impossible for people to reach out to people like this because the government is so untrustworthy",
            "Ahhh, it is just so sad.",
            "I am sure very rich people have looked into helping but I don't think anybody can help them",
            "I just can't imagine living somewhere like that and trying to raise my children and give them the life they deserve.",
            "Me neither, I have 2 kids and they get everything they want/need... I couldn't imagine it any other way",
            "Same here, but even sometimes I wonder \"Have I given them everything they need?\"",
            "Exactly, I think that all the time and its about dumb stuff like shoes and pokemon cards. It makes me really appreciate what we have in this country",
            "Yes, this story definitely makes you realize how good we have it.",
            "I've been doing these Empathic Conversation HITS for the last 2 or 3 weeks and its so sad how people in other countries are living and I do not think many americans are aware of it",
            "You're so right, these hits make me so sad all of the time. And if you watch our news, sometimes it seems like they are saying that our country is so terrible. If people paid more attention to what is actually happening all over the world, maybe they would realize how good we have it.",
            "Yea the only think I see on the news is about politics and its so annoying, nobody is aware of the world we live in and apparently neither am I because I didn't know about these issues until I started doing these HITS",
            "Yeah, you really have to go outside of the mainstream media to find much that is just about our country and our politics. I love watching documentaries on different cultures and issues occurring around the world.",
            "I do too, its very interesting",
            "It's been great talking to you!",

            "It was a whole lot easier to have a revolution before guns. Now if you storm the castle your going to get shot.",

            "I agree I rather die fighting, but I hope I never have to make that choice.",
            "Agreed, and I'm pretty sure we won't.  Or if we do, it certainly won't be because of the same causes as they are in Venezuela.",
            "America is not far off the have and the have nots, but our standard of not having nothing is a lot better than how some people are living in the world.",
            "Yeah, I think there's a big difference between having one meal per day that requires standing in food lines, and not being able to afford the smartphone you want.",
            "I wouldn't know how to tell my children that we are not eating today.",
            "Yeah.  I also wondered how long these families keep sending their kids to school at all.  At what point is mere survival more important.",
            "Yeah, there is no point of learning if you can not even feed yourself.",
            "Oh well, hopefully this gets better.  And at some point I guess it will.  I'm not sure how it looks when it does, but oppression and tyranny don't last forever.",
            "I bet if feels like a life time for the people that it is happening to.",

Then, you have the people fleeing the country only to end up in more compromising positions, but beyond that I'm pretty uninformed as well.",

They are innocents.  There were other chioces he could have made to cope with what he was going through, which I\"m sure was a lot.",

I'm not expressing sympathy. I rarely have any for those who harm women and children, just stating the facts that i'm familiar with.",

            "I think it's something that would take an immense amount of time and effort to mourn properly and then confront the emotions you are feeling with an open mind and a supportive network of friends/family. The process would be absolutely daunting at the outset, but people are pretty tenacious.",
            "Yeah you would definitely need a good support network.  People are certainly resilient but this woman lost everything.  So very tragic.",

            "Reading about that situation with the poachers was pretty upsetting. To think that the changes being made to ensure poaching ends and they are being stopped by local governments is just upsetting.",
            "Yes, although I'm not sure it was local governments, just local villagers.  Still, that must have been a horribly frightening experience.",
            "Yeah that could be possible, and so terrifying to just be doing your job and being attacked like that. I wonder if this is the right way to stop poaching, or if there was a better way than having people just have to grab poachers in towns like that.",
            "Yes, I'm not sure.  The whole article was a little sparse on details, which I would have appreciated.  It didn't explicitly say what the villagers were angry about, although one could guess.  And I also wondered who called for the helicopter.  Seems unlikely the rangers would have survived that scenario, but who knows.",
            "Yeah it definetely felt like the article just wanted you to just to the conclusions on your own. I'm guessing the poachers were members of the community and that caused the mob. I wonder how the poahcer even got away from them in the first place.",
            "Yes, the fact that he escaped seemed incompetent, unfortunately.  But of course that's a large part of the story.  There aren't enough resources or competence to properly deal with the issue.  And there's probably corruption, too.",
            "Yeah for sure as easy as it seems there is so much ground for them to cover and animals to protect. If only they had more resources or there was a way to stop black market trade so poachers are not incentivized to hunt these animals.",
            "Yes, I think that's one of the tacks governments are taking is to focus on the demand.  Not sure how well it's worked but they're definitely putting pressure on things like ivory demand, maybe similar to same way that there's sort of a backlash against blood diamonds.  I was curious what animals were being poached in this story.  I don't believe it said, did it?",
            "No i don't think there was a mention of it. They only mentioned the country and the continent so the first thing my mind jumped to was to african elephants which i think are still endangered. I definitely think that there is progress being made on poaching and hope stories like this are not commen.",
            "Yes, I think it's particularly disheartening when the story is of the authorities losing the battle.  I guess I feel like if nothing is currently being done to stop it, then there's the distinct possibility that change can and will happen.  But if they're already trying and failing, then it feels less likely to me that things can improve.",
            "Yeah for sure, it seems like we never really hear articles that are good news or updates on constant issues. Or maybe that is that people know that those articles would not cause as much noise so there is less interest in talking about them.",
            "Yes, I certainly think that's part of it.  I'm curious what will happen to the people in the village?  The article is concerned about the cowardly police officers, and I get that.  But will there be any charges brought to the villagers for nearly killing the rangers?  I'd like to know that.",
            "I don't think there is any good way to deal with the villagers, if it was a mob of people that attacked them then what do you do arrest them all? I think at best the rangers just now no they must be careful with that village.",
            "Yes, that's a good point.  Unfortunately, I think it only serves to embolden and legitimize their actions.  If there are no repercussions for waging \"war\" on anti-poaching, then how can the anti-poaching side ever have any real authority and success?",
            "Definetely it sends the message that if you want to poach then just make sure that the nearest village is benefiting from it and you wont need to worry. Maybe the government sends people to the villages to work as police or peacekeepers of some sort but that could just make tensions worse.",
            "Yeah, if nothing else I'd certainly be nervous to be the guy sent there, seeing how they treated these rangers.  I feel like you'd probably have to convince people associated with poaching that there's an economically viable alternative to their poaching.  The problem is that I'm not sure what that is in Mozambique.",
            "Yeah me either, it seems like all these people see is the money lost from not poaching. It feels bad but maybe there should be incentives for villages if the population of poached animals gets above a certain point?",
            "Yes, that's certainly an idea.  I think it's just human nature.  It's Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.  We can entertain ideas of democracy and harmony and enlightenment and whatever, so long as we're fed and clothed and housed.  But if our basic needs aren't being met, we're going to scrap and claw for what sustains us, broader society and the world be damned.",
            "Definetely, and people can only really see things for their immediate self. It is hard to think of the overall elephant population when you are now going hungry because you cannot hunt them. Oh well, even though it was about a harsh topic it was nice talking to you. goodbye",
            "Yes, I appreciated your perspective.  It made me think.  Thanks for taking the time to chat.  Have a nice day.  bye"

Only if the entire animal is being used for meat, food, etc. like it should be.  They didn't give many specifics about that in this story.  How do you feel about it?",

            "Yeah I agree.  There is no good solution, it",
            "It's also possible that the Taliban, in whatever form it currently takes, is mostly pissed off about U.S. presence, and if we leave they could theoretically make some attempt to reconcile with the Afghan government.  But who knows.",

            "I just feel that in most of the instances, home or terrorist, our government is always reacting, like remove your shoes at the airport because there was a shoe bomber.

            "Exactly. Listen I'm all for being tolerant but we have a lot of problems at home already we can't just let everyone in. Can you imagine that.",
            "Absolutely.  We live by laws and borders, for the betterment of the most.  We have to keep doing that.  And I think a nation's and a government's first responsibility is to its own people.  As I say, I'd like a democratic process to decide how countries deal with these issues.  Let the people decide whether they want masses of refugees coming in. Why isn't that the people's say?",
            "Yeah we have no problem helping other countries get better. We should just focus on making their countries better.",
            "I'm curious as to where these refugees were from.  They were staying in Calais, which is in NW France, across from the UK.  It said their homes were burning.  That seems like a weird place for a refugee camp, or for people to be coming as refugees.",

            "Yeah, it seems the governments have an interest in letting this happen all across Europe though. Heck, even in our own southern border we've been getting African immigrants. It seems people from Mexico don't even cross to the US anymore it's all central american and african immigrants. I wonder who's sending them.",
            "Yeah, I don't know.  But I fear it's going to be a bigger and bigger problem as transportation and communication become easier and make people, including large groups, more mobile",
            "yeah it seems like technology makes it easier for these people to come together",
            "I think it's also easier for them to see other lifestyles and cultures and understand that there are better lives elsewhere.  That encourages them to flee.",

We cannot continue to solve problems of immigrants but rather help them fix their own country so they don't end up in this situation in the first place!",
            "i cant speak for t he french but i wouldnt want so many immigrants maybe a few but not that many",

            "True. Seems like it would be. I haven't kept up to date with this story but I wonder how these people are getting into Turkey. Are they crossing illegally or being given refuge? I'm not sure.",

            "Same. I was making good money and this story puts a downer on the day. I hope more countries in that area take some people in. I can't believe other Middle Eastern countries aren't taking refugees. Or I assume they're not since I never hear about it.",
            "Literally the only thing I have really heard about Syrian refugees is the polarizing arguments on why the US should/shouldn't take them in. Whoever wrote that article is doing good work getting that information out.",
            "Yes! That's all you hear about here is people squawking about taking those on the brink of death and/or starvation in. It's embarrassing sometimes. People don't realize it doesn't have to be forever. Just maybe until the war is over and the area is rebuilt.",
            "It is embarrassing! Like look around yourself and see how good you have it! There's so much excess, why is it so hard to share your space with people who are terrified and trying to find sanctuary?",
            "I think it's easy to have that mentality if you've never seen it up close and personal for some people. I have some people like that in my family and I know their opinions would change if they area had to stay in such a place for any period of time. I think this is our last turn?",
            "Haha, roundabout way to end with the whole \"ignorance is bliss\" theme. And all that. So then you start with a bye and I say bye after that, right?",
            "Laugh out loud yeah. Ok, thanks for the chat. Bye.",

            "Where was he for 38 hours that he would not have come back to the car?  I agree.  Police have procedures for everything.",

            "Maybe he was punishing the dog or was sick of him or something.   I think those dogs live with their handlers.",
            "Sounds like sick of the dog.  Just tie him up outside.   I can't relate honestly",
            "Yeah, I don't get it, whether it was intentional or unintentional.  That hurts the police force, too.  Those dogs aren't easy to come by and I'm sure the officers love having one on the force.",
            "They are not easy to come by.  My son-in-law is a Seal and had difficulty in obtaining well trained dogs",
            "Yeah, that's part of the reason I said this guy must be ashamed to see his fellow officers.  He just killed a partner, valuable resource and protector of them.",
            "Absolutely correct.   I know we are suppose to write 10 sentences each but I am running out of comments",
            "Did you ever lose a dog?  I did when I was younger.  She got lost and I dreamed about her every night for a month.  It sucked.",
            "I had a dog that we all loved so very much.   His name was Blackie.   We had a visitor and their little boy was \"teasing\" him with a stick and he snipped at him.   My dad said if a dog bites once he will bite again and he gave him away.  I do not know if that is correct but we were devastated.",
            "Wow, yeah, that would have devastated me.  I'm sorry to hear that.  Dogs certainly become members of the family and it's awful to lose them.",
            "Yes it is.   Well according to the instructions I am leaving the chat with a lower case word.  Then you said it lower case and answer the exit question.   It has been a pleasure today.   goodbye",
            "Yes, nice talking with you.  Have a good day.  goodbye"

You can't unsee it.    Kids are committing suicide because of bullying.   They are all obsessed with \"friends\" likes and thinking what is posted is their real life.   It's all a fraud",

            "Kids just cant handle it at that age it becomes too much. I'm definitely taking your advice when my kids are of age and give them a flip phone. Better to be safe than sorry with social media! Its been a great talk. Have a great day! bye",

And you're going to eat the meat and use the parts.  Hunting just to kill things like a giraffe for a trophy or an endangered species is unacceptable to me.  What do you think?",

            "I think creating laws that go against that type of behavior is the first step the problem is money talks and these rich poachers would try their hardest to stop it.",

            "Yes, but most of those people did something to deserve that.",
            "That's debatable. There are people the world over her are imprisoned for being raised to believe in a particular religion, or for holding a particular ideology. I'm just attempting to point out that the world at large has little mind for the suffering of those they are not directly involved with. Do you think the elephant could be successfully reintegrated into a more natural habitat after so many years of abuse and neglect?",

Factory farming is an ethical wasteland, and very little is going to be done to improve the circumstances for those poor creatures without significant external pressure. I firmly believe they shouldn't be imprisoned for amusement.",

            "Industrial livestock production that focuses on maximizing output through use of hormones/pen that restrict full range of motion and minimizing bottom line production costs.",

I work with refugee families here in Denver that were relocated to us because of the violence and wars in their regions.   I love all of them so much.",

            "I hope so.    Their stories are so sad but they are bright, happy children.   Several from the regions of Africa really brighten up when they share the animals they saw there and how they protected themselves.   It really isn't like we all imagine.",

            "I have four children too. Yeah if it effects other people than I support the ban, but if it only hurts smokers then that is on them.",
            "I mean I honestly can go either way.  It's not something I'm passionate about or would sit around arguing in favor of.  I just think it's a good idea bc people smoking at playgrounds irritates me.  I hate secondhand smoke.  But whatever, I guess at the end of the day if it bothers you so much you can leave the playground.",
            "I lumps things like this into the pile of the government telling people what to do with their bodies.",
            "yeah, I can see that too.  But children's playgrounds are made for kids.  Like, an adult has no  business smoking there.  Maybe step to the parking lot and smoke?",
            "I can agree with you on playgrounds",
            "Yeah, zoos and parks not so much.  It still annoys me for people to smoke there, but that's a public space.  so there's that.",

            "Yeah, that's really unfortunate for the people who legitimately need medicines.  Even when I have had surgery, it is practically impossible to get enough medicine after the surgery so I can only imagine how you feel.  So ridiculous.",
            "Yeah, it really sucks. That is why I would never tell another person what to do with their body.",
            "Yeah, I hear your argument for sure.  But there is also the point of respecting children's right not to breathe secondhand smoke.  Let's just say only in areas that are made specifically for kids.",
            "I agree. If what you do effects other people then it should be banned.",
            "Yeah, no doubt.  But I totally get your point about when it only affects yourself, it's your choice. I can get behind that.  I hope you have a great day, goodbye",

            "I guess I'm not all that averse to the notion of limiting children's exposure to second-hand smoke through regulations.  But the explanation for why these people wanted to do it seemed bizarre.  To prevent children from seeing people smoke... I don't agree with that.",
            "As a smoker myself, I felt the need to parley with the author of the article.",
            "How do you feel about the dwindling space and opportunity you have to smoke?  Do you think you should be allowed to smoke anywhere?  I think it's certainly a mixed message we send about smoking.  It's legal.... only we don't want you to do it anywhere.",
            "Frankly, I enjoy the fact that the space is dwindling. Smoking is more than a nicotine fix for me. It also gives me an excuse and an opportunity to get away from other people for a while. The only time it really bothers me is when I've got a flight with connections.",

I was just curious what your take is as a smoker.  i'm not a smoker, but in most situations I'm not averse to the idea of people being allowed to smoke.",
            "It may not be an apt analogy, but I equate smoking in public to open carry. I'm not comfortable with seeing a person holding a gun on their hip, it makes me nervous for my health and the health of those around me. But, people are allowed to do it and I just keep my distance.",
            "Yeah, I can understand that.  I'm sure that part of my attitude towards smoking is from experience.  I grew up with people smoking in public and around me, so it was never strange.  But people who grew up more recently view it very differently.  Think about how crazy it is to think that, not so insanely long ago, people could smoke on a plane.  It seems like another planet.",
            "Planes, schools, hospitals... I'm trying to think of another behavior that has been similarly restricted but i'm coming up short.",
            "Yeah, in my lifetime I can't think of any.  When was public drinking outlawed?  That was probably legal at one time.  Times do change.  Drinking and driving wasn't always illegal.  And one of my family's first cars didn't have seatbelts.  And that was legal.",
            "My grandfather had a '57 Chevy that didn't have seatbelts. You can still have open containers in Missouri. Our childhood hasn't disappeared yet.",
            "I wouldn't mind seeing some restrictions on cell phone use.  Civility would spike dramatically if people had to look at real people more often, I think.",
            "That's actually an idea everyone could profit from. Imagine having to look service workers in the face and appreciate their contribution to society at large.",
            "Yeah, it's interesting how as a society we're up in arms about one addiction (smoking) while disregarding another one.",

            "exactly and i think dying is way worse then side effects they might have been concerned about",
            "Exactly.  It gave them a 50-65% to live.",
            "yes, i wish there was more they could do to prepare for epidemics",
            "I learned that President Polk died from it.   Folks studied New York outbreaks and found it was from one place.",
            "oh wow that is interesting i cant believe 2019 and people are dying from more curable disease",
            "The article stated late 1800s but I can't remember the year from the article.  I didn't know it was ever in the US",
            "oh wow, maybe because our clean water systems it is not a thing anymore",
            "Exactly.   Folks in 3rd world countries have no clean water anywhere and aren't educated enough to know what to do.   I thought the Bill and Melinda Gates reference was a great testament in how they give back because of their success.",
            "yes, the gates family are great philanthropist i admire i wish there were more. I like how the foundation is empowering women to sell the chlorine tablets to prevent the epidemic",
            "Agreed.  What I didn't come away with is why the WHO is so difficult to get things passed when it comes to deadly diseases.  It's very antiquated.",
            "yes, there should be a system put in place for these poor countries that suffer natural disasters to prevent these epidemics",
            "Absolutely should.   What else surprised you in the article?",
            "i like the idea that you shouldnt rely on vaccines but also implement preventatives because it is so hard to fight epidemics once they start",
            "I just wonder if it has been effective.   The world is past another pandemic of some sort.  It's coming but I do not think CDC or WHO are ready if it happens.",

            "And society has reached a point where lives would be lost in getting the vaccine or medication.  It would be mass chaos around the world because there are so many more people.",
            "oh i agree and then with travel and that thing i cant imagine",
            "I have actually been to Haiti on a mission trip.  It has forever changed my life's approach",
            "oh wow that is great of you to do that i know they have been changed since what was it and earthquake or tsunami?",
            "Of course, Port Au Prince always needs help.  It really makes you tearful.   I went on a mission where there were many illnesses in the mountains.   No stores, little clean water, and bartering for what you needed.   There were so many sick people they lined up at 4:30 in the morning when the sun came up and stayed until sunset.   There was no electricity.",
            "Wow, I wonder if there was more light brought to places like there if there would be more effort to help them. I believe we should help develop third world sick countries to build themselves up",
            "I believe so.  When there are no bathroom facilities and tarantulas everywhere, most folks say no.   The people there were so gracious.  They have to garden their own food and have a few chickens so food is very scarce; yet, they wanted to prepare a dinner for us.",
            "aw that is nice! im glad there are people like you who go in and try and help and understand not many poeople do.",
            "They are missing out on a beautiful, giving experience.   I really do not have any other comments on the article I read but we have to keep going.   I always wonder why there aren't more Bill and Melinda Gates in the world.  Everything is centered around me, me, me.",
            "i agree i think he actually gave away most of his fortune to charity",

            "at this point I'm pretty sure it will be some sort of crypto backed by gold reserves that's why you see China and Russia hording gold right now all the major banks are developing their version of crypto while publicly bashing it they want to get rid of physical cash since there is no transaction history everyone needs to carry the mark of the beast",
            "Yeah, the only thing is that the rest of the world, particularly China, is so heavily invested in the US dollar.  Can they afford to let it be destroyed?",
            "the chinese and the russians have slowly been moving away from the dollar their doing trade deals in their own currencies especially with oil the death of the petrodollar is happening thats why venezuala iran are so imprtant to go to war with",

            "Going to war with Iran is inevitable they need it to happen in order to start the whole thing off remember we have not been touched by war we never had missiles rain down on NYC. The new axis will be Russia, China, Iran, and Turkey will turn on us. At the end of it who knows what will come maybe a single world government.",

I read that the Rohingya that fled to Bangladesh are no being forced back into Burma. The situation with the forced reeducation of Uyghers in China. Seems like there's a lot going on.",

People (myself included) find it really hard to put themselves into these oppressed people's shoes because the idea of living in a makeshift hovel and being persecuted for your religion is such a foreign concept.",

            "They probably don't care if they die. What do you think?",
            "I agree. Knowing what little I do about the situation it seems that they are being blamed for circumstances they have very little control over in order to incite violence against them.",

            "I don't have a problem with us intervening.  It's really a proxy war between Iran and KSA.",
            "Yeah i'm a bit on the fence about it myself as i know that the situation in the country will be awful without us but with us there are still innocents being hurt like the taxi driver in the article.",
            "Yes, they certainly have a tough go of it. But I think Saudi Arabia has a right to defend itself.  Their priority should be to their own citizens, not Yemeni citizens.  That's how I feel.",
            "I agree definetely. One thing that i have been wondering though is the location of the sites hits, hospitals etc. it seems like whenever air strikes are involved the collateral gets a bit to high and like resolution in other means should be attempted",
            "Yeah, it's hard to know what's going on there.  Sometimes I wonder how much of what we hear is just propaganda from either side.",
            "Definetely, feels like the only people who know what is actually going on are the civilians and soldiers or volunteers with their boots on the ground.",
            "I think it's strange what it said about the U.S. decreasing its advisors to the coalition.  The article said that was distance themselves from it.  But if they had problems with how it was operating, I'd think the better tack would be to increase advisors to have more control over how it's run.",
            "Yeah that makes sense, maybe the fix they think is that the current advisors are making mistakes in the way they operate and are trying to narrow it down to fewer key people. Or make that information is getting muddied in translation within the coalition and they are harder to control.",
            "Yes, that could be.  I just hope we can find a better way to fight these conflicts with terrorist and rebel groups.  We struggle with these small groups that are embedded in civilian populations.  And when we try to spare the civiliians it makes the job that much tougher.",
            "yeah definetely, the real shame and real war crime here is that these rebel groups see the civilian populous as nothing more than a shield that they hide behind to make finding peace more difficult. And with ever strike more of the civilians will aid them and see their side of things.",
            "Yes, that's a great point.  I think it's important to remember who started the fighting.  The coalition may not be responding effectively or compassionately, but they wouldn't be fighting at all had it not been the Iranian-backed rebels starting it all.",
            "Definetely but still they have a duty to find a resolution and end to the conflict with as little casualties as possible, it seems like often in conflicts like this people only think of the quickest way to end things and rarely the safest way to.",
            "It will be interesting to see what happens now after that drone strike on Saudi oil facilities.  That's the country's lifeblood.  That's their entire existence.  They can't stand for that.  I wonder how they respond.",
            "That was one of the first thing i thought of when i heard about the strike. That impacts to many pockets too not have a big response. I hope that the US advisors are able to deter any major response there because it really makes me fear for the civilians if they are not able to.",
            "Yes, the response could be severe.  The country already is having financial problems, and that threatens the viability of the monarchy.  So they'll want to strike back hard.  What did it say that taxi driver had?  8 children?  I guess a lot of people in these conflict areas know what it's like to be orphans or lose loved ones.",
            "Yeah eight children, and they are definetely all aware of just how dangerous being in the area is as the driver joked with his family he hoped he was able to return that day. What other option do they have to stay though, leave the country and become refugees. So few countries are willing to accept them.",
            "Yeah, and Yemen is pretty isolated down there.  Can't even recall which countries they border, other than Saudi Arabia, who certainly doesn't want anything to do with them. Also, the region is mostly desert, which makes migration impossible in many directions.",
            "Exactly feels like it is the worst case scenario for the civilians there. Well even though the subject matter was pretty depressing it was nice talking to you. bye",
            "Yes, nice chatting with you,too.  Have a nice day.  bye"

At first they said it was a drone strike from Yemen, but then there were accusations it came from Iran itself, or from people inside KSA.  Either way it's backed/supported by Iran, and it's something the Saudi monarchy cannot tolerate if they want to survive, because the stability of their entire country depends on oil production.  So I wonder how they'll respond.  Saving individual Yemeni cab drivers realistically should not be their priority when millions of Saudis existences are at stake.",
