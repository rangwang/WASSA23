We seem to do ok over here in the West.</s>Hello! To a certain extent. I mean, the recent attacks on synagogues and widespread prejudice against Muslims here in the west doesn't seem to be too far removed.Good point. Maybe I am a bit biased in this. I am not a very religious person. Personally I think it causes more problems in the world. Too many violent acts in the name of God, or Allah, etc. The needless loss of life is quite saddening.I agree and am on the same page when it comes to religiosity. It seems like these militant groups in the Middle East are sincerely devoted to unmaking thousands of years of human progress."}

{"label": 3.0, "text": "Haha, no. That was over 15 years ago. Do you have any ideas on the appropriate response to widespread bullying?I think it depends. I think the bully that happens today is a bit different from the kind many experienced back then. Also, kids that get bullied today, their response to bullying varies.I understand that, but there are a limited amount of ways to respond to verbal and physical abuse. I don't think that the way children respond varies much from when we were children. I think the key difference is that bullying doesn't end just because you're home from school. It can be something that haunts you around the clock day in and day out.<s>Yes, that's what i meant. Bullying does not end even when you're home. What do you think would be an appropriate response to bullying?</s>Unplugging, first and foremost. I don't participate in social media, but I think that it has been an overwhelmingly negative influence on society. The reason that children go to the lengths that this French girl did is because they feel absolutely alone in their suffering. Inclusion is the answer. Something as simple as assigning each child a emotional support classmate could do wonders for kids who are being singled out.That is true. Social media has made a great impact on younger generations. I cannot imagine the impact it would have had on me as a kid. I do agree that inclusion is important and vital. I have never thought of the idea of assigning emotional support classmates. That is an absolutely great idea. Have you seen this used in the real world?No, not in any kind of administrative capacity. But, I think that it could potentially be very effective. The modern world has a way of distorting the best of intentions though."}

And I later googled that elephant tusks go for around 400k. And in poor areas in Africa, that's basically lottery money. And at that point, I'm not sure you can even blame the poachers. You blame the people who are buying the ivory and elephant parts for ancient medicine stuff. It's disgusting that they think elephant or whale parts will affect diseases."}

When people divorce after a long marriage, do you think they have another partner already in mind?Certainly could be.  But I think there are other people who are just looking to go explore.  But I'd be surprised if people left a long-term marriage without the intent of finding someone else.  Like, just to go be alone.  That would surprise me.If they just wanted to be alone, they probably grew to detest their long-term partner. What's interesting is that even though my dad hated my mom during the divorce and for years later, now they are on speaking terms. Time heals all wounds I guess. Anyway, it was nice talking to you, have a good day.<s>Yeah, nice talking to you.  bye</s>bye"}

Do you know if father rhinos care for the young rhinos too?No I don't, but I don't expect that they do. In most mammals the females exclusively raise the young. I wonder how they orphans are discovered initially?I guess some people must've stumbled on the young rhino. Similar to when kittens and puppies are sent to shelters. Also the rhino might've not been orphaned, it could've just been born in the animal sanctuary.<s>That makes sense. How long do you think a baby rhino can last in the wild without its mother?</s>They are herbivores, so they don't need to \"hunt\" for food like other meat eaters. So they would have sustenance, it's just a matter of surviving other predators until they are tough enough to protect themselves. I don't think many young animals survive without their mothers.Yeah I was wondering how long they would be able to avoid predators. Without their mothers they are pretty much defenseless.

It doesn't make sense how people could look at the animals that are affected and not think maybe we shouldn't do this.I feel like sadly it is only going to get worse because right now a lot of the world is refusing to believe they are destroying the earth.<s>I agree, i actually don't think it is possible for it to get better before it gets worse. People need to actually see the outcome of there actions before they can change.</s>I know this is kind of morbid, but I feel like maybe all the scientists are right and we really only have a certain number of years left before we kill the earth. Feels like they are getting close to cutting all the trees down at least.They have to be getting close, and i believe it honestly. With how much pollution that has occured for the sake of greed i pray that we are able to change before the we finish the job on the earth.It would be nice to see some sort of group created that has the power to punish all countries that allow stuff like this to happen."}

Sorry, this story gets me steamed.that's a lot of years, but perhaps he deserves it.I think so. If his partner was a human, or there was someone handcuffed in the back, and he/she left them there, and they died, everyone would be flipping out. A lot of people don't feel the dog's life is worth as much as a person's, and like I said, we need to set a precedent here to deter problems like this to begin with.<s>I wonder if a policy like that would cause them to stop using dogs altogether. Maybe that would be for the best, idk</s>Or maybe the police force would be more careful. I definitely see what you're saying, though. I apologize for getting rant-y about the issue.no, I think you're being very reasonable. Yeah maybe they would be more careful. They definitely should be.I'm very liberal in almost all of my views, until it comes to the justice system, then it gets a little more extreme on my end.
