{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Jeanne Shaheen \"We spend in tax loopholes annually $1.1 trillion. That's more than we spend on our defense budget in a year, on Medicare or Medicaid in a year.\"", "evidence": "Military and \u00a0entitlement spending may be among the country\u2019s biggest expenses. But, with more than $1 trillion in tax revenue sacrificed each year, cutting expenses may not be the only way to solve the country\u2019s deficit woes, according to U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H.\n\n\"We spend in tax loopholes annually $1.1 trillion,\" Shaheen said during a May 31, 2012 meeting with The Telegraph editorial board. \"That\u2019s more than we spend on our defense budget in a year, on Medicare or Medicaid in a year. \u2026 So we\u2019ve got to deal with the revenue side because we just can\u2019t get there (with spending cuts alone).\"\n\nTax loopholes have generated a lot of discussion during the election season, which has been dominated by discussion of the wealthiest 1 percent versus the other 99 percent. But, the premise that the U.S. gives away $1.1 trillion in loopholes is an intriguing concept. PolitiFact decided to take a look.\n\nTo start, we reached out to Shaheen\u2019s office, which pointed us to the White House. As part of its Fiscal Year 2013 budget proposal, the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget keeps a spreadsheet of tax expenditures, which includes all tax exclusions, exemptions, deductions and credits, among other revenue losses, do match Shaheen\u2019s $1.1 trillion figure, adding up to $1.172 trillion to be exact.\n\nThat number does exceed the entire defense budget. For Fiscal Year 2013, the White House projects $700 billion in defense spending - down from $709 billion in FY2012 and up from 699 in FY2011, according to the President\u2019s 2013 budget proposal.\n\nThe $1.1 trillion figure also beats out the numbers for Medicare and Medicaid, as Shaheen claimed. According to the budget proposal, the country will spend $528 billion on Medicare in 2013, along with $283 billion on Medicaid.\n\nSo, the numbers line up. But, does the language? Do the tax expenditures meet Shaheen\u2019s characterization of loopholes? That leaves more room for debate.\n\nAccording to the White House, the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 defines tax expenditures as \"revenue losses attributable to provisions of the Federal tax laws which allow a special exclusion, exemption, or deduction from gross income or which provide a special credit, a preferential rate of tax, or a deferral of tax liability.\"\n\nIn short, expenditures include all deductions, exemptions, credits and other programs that lead to revenue losses from the tax system. But are those really loopholes? For example, can the popular home mortgage deduction -- a key part of most families' 1040s -- be considered a loophole?\n\nContacted later, Shaheen's office referred to the Webster\u2019s Dictionary definition of \"loophole,\" which defines the term as \"a means of evading an obligation,\" according to Jonathan Lipman, her communications director.\n\n\"All tax expenditures, by definition, allow taxpayers to avoid paying the full tax rate,\" Lipman wrote in an e-mail to the Telegraph.\n\nBut, some tax analysts take a different view.\n\nThe list of tax exemptions certainly includes many ways for individuals and businesses to evade their tax obligations. But they also include many basic elements of our tax system, according to Donald Marron, director of the Tax Policy Center, an analyst group led by the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution.\n\nThese include exemptions for social security benefits, state and local taxes, veterans pensions and employee benefits, among hundreds of others.\n\nTo do away with these expenditures would be to rewrite major facets of the federal tax structure, said Marron, former interim director of the Congressional Budget Office, who wrote the article \"How Large Are Tax Expenditures? A 2012 Update.\"\n\n\"Some tax expenditures are loopholes, but a lot of them are very broad economic or social policies,\" he said. \"They\u2019re fundamental choices about how we choose to define our tax system.\"\n\nFor example, removing the tax exclusion for employer health insurance contributions could take more from workers\u2019 paychecks, and eliminating the deduction for interest on student loans could drive students deeper into debt.\n\n\"(Loophole) is a very common term used on both sides, but I think, when people look behind what those expenditures were, that's not what comes to mind,\" added Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nOur ruling:\n\nThe official definition aside, we think loophole conjures images of a narrow tax break that gives a special -- and, in many cases, unfair -- advantage to a specific constituency. But we don't think the entire list of tax deductions, exemptions, credits fits that definition.\n\nShe's right about the total cost of those \"expenditures,\" but her definition of loophole is a big stretch"}
{"label": "false", "claim": "Chris Abele Says he \"helped lead an outside audit that\u2019ll save (Milwaukee County) taxpayers over $200 million.\"", "evidence": "In the final days before the Sept. 14 primary, the Republican gubernatorial candidates are focused more on the past than the future -- chiefly, the 1998 federal transportation bill, Mark Neumann\u2019s vote for it and what rival Scott Walker said about it at the time.\n\nIt began with a Walker ad that faulted Neumann for voting for the pork-laden bill, which included the infamous \"bridge to nowhere\" in Alaska, and equating him with current Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The two are hardly ideological soul mates, and we rated that connection False.\n\nNeumann struck back with his own ad.\n\n\"Scott Walker claims I\u2019m Nancy Pelosi?\" Neumann says, speaking to the camera. \"He must be kidding. The vote Scott Walker\u2019s attacking me for, he supported too. The bill he calls pork today, he said would save the taxpayers money, back then.\"\n\nWe\u2019ll stop there for a closer look.\n\nAs the pork line is read, an image of a June 15, 1998 letter to the editor that appeared in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel appears. It settles on and partially highlights in yellow this line: \"In our opinion, supporting these projects is a better use of the funds and will ultimately save Milwaukee County taxpayers money.\"\n\nThe letter is signed by Walker, then a member of the state Assembly representing Wauwatosa.\n\nIs it a smoking gun?\n\nThe Walker letter came about three weeks after the May 22, 1998 vote in the U.S. House on the big road and transit bill. The letter makes it clear he and five other state lawmakers representing Milwaukee County backed a specific change in transportation funding made possible by a provision in the bill.\n\nThat provision, inserted by U.S. Rep. Tom Petri, R-Fond du Lac, lifted a requirement that $241 million in federal money set aside for Milwaukee be used on either a light rail system or freeway bus and car-pool lanes in the East-West Corridor between Milwaukee and Waukesha.\n\nWalker, a longtime light-rail opponent, wanted the funds to go instead to freeway reconstruction in Milwaukee, including the Marquette Interchange, and the county bus system. He has long opposed light rail as a waste of taxpayer money, too costly to build and likely to lead to long-term government subsidies.\n\nSo, at issue now is what Walker was pointing to in the \"money saving\" statement highlighted in the Neumann ad. Was Walker talking about the full bill with its $9 billion in pork, or the provision that moved money from light rail to other purposes?\n\nAnd, by supporting that piece of the bill, was Walker supporting the entire bill?\n\nStart with the money savings.\n\nIn addition to the letter in the TV ad, the Neumann campaign also cited a May 30, 1998 Journal Sentinel story quoting from a letter that Walker and the five other state lawmakers sent to then-Gov. Tommy Thompson the day before.\n\nIn the letter to Thompson, Walker and the others are clearly focused on the Petri provision.\n\n\"We believe the taxpayers of Milwaukee County will benefit from not being forced to use these transportation funds\" on a light rail system or special freeway lanes, the letter read.\n\nWalker certainly did not say the entire bill would save taxpayers money.\n\nThe provision in question did not increase funding. The $241 million in question had been appropriated seven years earlier and was sitting unspent.\n\nThe Neumann campaign has not pointed to any statement of support by Walker for the full bill but notes that in legislative bodies you either vote up or down on a measure; in the end, you don\u2019t get to pick and choose pieces of it.\n\nIronically, that\u2019s what Neumann complained about in the wake of the first ad -- he didn\u2019t like the pork but supported the bill because of other policy aspects, especially because it prevented the siphoning off of federal gas tax proceeds for non-transportation purposes.\n\nSo what about the central statement by Neumann?\n\nHe\u2019s not totally off base. Walker\u2019s only public comments were actually in favor of one provision in the bill. Walker did not qualify his remarks to suggest he liked the Petri provision but was against the whole bill. We could find no record of Walker opposing the full bill or the $9 billion in pork.\n\nBut by pairing the highlighted words from Walker\u2019s letter with Neumann\u2019s narration, it leaves viewers with the impression that the words refer to support for the full bill.

Then what about what's happening in Washington? Zack Space voted for Nancy Pelosi's budgets and debt, for job-killing energy taxes, and for her wasteful stimulus. And we still lost more than 2.5 million jobs. With Pelosi and Space's agenda, it can feel like you're getting robbed. This November, vote against Zack Space.\"\n\nThe ad comes from Americans for Job Security, a conservative anti-tax group. The group does not disclose its donors, and that has led to questions about who funds the group and for what purposes. The ad, called \"Robbed,\" is part of an ad buy against several Democratic candidates around the country. The ad targets Space of Ohio, Pennsylvania Rep. Jason Altmire and Democratic challengers Bryan Lentz of Pennsylvania and Trent Van Haaften of Indiana. For Lentz and Van Haaften, the ad says that each candidate \"wants to join Nancy Pelosi,\" and then lists the measures as\u00a0 \"Pelosi's agenda.\"\n\nThe ad mentions major pieces of legislation passed by Democrats in Congress and labels them a failure because \"we still lost more than 2.5 million jobs.\" Take away the scary robber imagery, and it's a fairly straightforward claim.\n\nWe decided to fact-check the ad for Space, who represents eastern Ohio and is a member of the Blue Dog coalition, a group of fiscally conservative Democrats. We'll take the ads' claims about him in order.\n\n\u2022 Space \"voted for budgets and debt.\"\n\nSpace did vote for the 2010 budget, a vote that in the U.S. House of Representatives was mostly along party lines, 233-193. (Seventeen Democrats voted with Republicans in opposition.)\n\nOne might argue that the budget is more President Barack Obama's than Nancy Pelosi's -- the president proposes the budget, and Congress votes on it. But Pelosi, as speaker of the House, leads the Democrats, who overwhelmingly approved the budget.\n\nBut the ad gets it wrong on Space's vote on \"debt.\" Here, the ad cites a vote from December 2009 that permitted the national debt limit to increase from $12.1 trillion to $12.39 trillion. The vote in this case was 218 to 214, with 39 Democrats joining all the Republicans.\n\nIn this case, Space voted with the Republicans and against raising the debt limit. So the ad gets this point wrong.\n\n\u2022 Space voted for \"job-killing energy taxes.\"\n\nThis is Americans for Job Security's way of saying that Space voted for major energy legislation (Republicans lately have been fond of putting \"job-killing\" in front of many things the Democrats support.) But as we've pointed out before, the legislation was for a cap-and-trade system, not an energy tax.\n\nAt its heart, cap-and-trade is a simple concept: To slow climate change, the government would set a cap on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. To comply, companies such as electric utilities must either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits \u2014 also known as allowances \u2014 to continue polluting. Presumably, the costs associated with that end up getting passed on to consumers.\n\nPolitiFact Ohio looked into this issue previously, when Republican candidate Bob Gibbs attacked Space for voting for the legislation, saying the measure would cost the average household \"approximately $1,761 per year in increased energy rates.\" We found that number to be a wild exaggeration, based on estimates that were not part of the bill that Space voted for. We rated that statement Pants on Fire. And whether the measure is job-killing is also a contested issue. Some say it will actually create jobs, and there's a lively debate on the issue. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that employment rates would be \"slightly lower\" if cap-and-trade passes.\n\nHere, we'll note that Space did vote for the cap-and-trade legislation, but calling it a \"energy tax\" is not an accurate way to describe the measure.\n\n"}
{"label": "true", "claim": "Nick Tsiongas \"Health care is the greatest contribution to spending increases in the state budget.\"", "evidence": "Vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan has made some of his sharpest attacks yet on Barack Obama\u2019s health care law, calling the law \"the greatest threat to Medicare.\"\n\nRyan himself advocates a plan to give voucher-like credits to seniors, so they can shop for a private plan or choose a traditional Medicare option. That plan has come under withering attack from Democrats.\n\nRyan fired back Aug. 29 during his acceptance speech at the at the Republican National Convention in Tampa.\n\n\"The biggest, coldest power play of all in Obamacare came at the expense of the elderly,\" Ryan said. \"You see, even with all the hidden taxes to pay for the health care takeover, even with a new law and new taxes on nearly a million small businesses, the planners in Washington still didn\u2019t have enough money. They needed more. They needed hundreds of billions more. \u00a0\n\n\"So, they just took it all away from Medicare, $716 billion, funneled out of Medicare by President Obama. An obligation we have to our parents and grandparents is being sacrificed, all to pay for a new entitlement we didn\u2019t even ask for. The greatest threat to Medicare is Obamacare, and we\u2019re going to stop it.\"\n\nRyan\u2019s comments are highly misleading. Neither Obama nor his health care law literally cut funding from the Medicare program\u2019s budget. Still, the number has a slight basis in fact.\n\nThe health care law instituted a number of changes to try to bring down future health care costs in the program. The total anticipated savings comes to $716 billion over the next 10 years, as determined by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nWe should note that both parties agree Medicare spending is increasing too fast as baby boomers retire and medical costs increase. The government needs to find savings so those costs don\u2019t overwhelm the federal budget in the future.\n\nSo, yes, Obama\u2019s law did find $716 billion in spending reductions. They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law made significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But the plans have actually cost the government more than traditional Medicare. The health care law scales back the payments to private insurers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nHospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nObama and fellow Democrats say the intention is to protect beneficiaries' coverage while forcing health care providers to become more efficient. Even with the health care law\u2019s cost-saving measures, the overall Medicare budget is still projected to go up for the foreseeable future.\n\nThere is a connection between the Medicare cost savings and the health care law. At the time the health care law was being finalized, Democrats said it was important to them that the new law not add to the deficit. So the reductions in Medicare spending were counted against the health care law\u2019s new spending.\n\nWe should point out that some new spending is within the Medicare program, such as increasing coverage for prescription drugs and offering preventive care with no out-of-pocket costs.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMore significantly, though, the law moves to cover the uninsured, by giving them tax credits to buy private insurance. It also expands Medicaid, the state insurance program for the poor. The savings from Medicare offset that spending.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe health law also imposes new taxes, primarily on the wealthy and on the health care industry. That, too, offsets the new spending.\n\nOur ruling\n\nRyan said Obama \"funneled\" $716 billion out of Medicare \"at the expense of the elderly.\" This gives a very misleading impression.\n\nIn fact, the law limits payments to health care providers and insurers to try to reduce the rapid growth of future Medicare spending. Lawmakers said they hoped the measures would improve care and efficiency. Those savings, spread out over the next 10 years, are then used to offset costs created by the law (especially coverage for the uninsured) so that the overall law doesn't add to the deficit"}

Jerry Brown signed this reform into law in April 2011 to ease state prison overcrowding. It shifted nonviolent offenders from state prisons to county jails or placed them on probation under county supervision rather than parole under state supervision.\n\n\nProposition 47: California voters approved this measure in November 2014. It downgraded drug possession and some thefts from felonies to misdemeanors and allowed tens of thousands of former offenders to remove felonies from their records.

Let\u2019s recap what happened.\nThe floor action\nThe Rubio camp argues that Murphy is constructing a straw man, since there wasn\u2019t a formal \"vote\" on the Hezbollah sanctions bill. Rather, it passed by unanimous consent -- a procedural mechanism in which senators are given an opportunity in advance to object to a bill or other action.\nUnder unanimous consent, if no advance objections are made, then the measure proceeds to the floor. At a prearranged time, a senator requests unanimous consent to consider the bill passed, and -- if the presiding officer hears no objection from senators in the chamber -- so orders. No individual votes are recorded and no other senators need to be present.\nThe bill in question was passed by unanimous consent on Nov. 17, 2015. (It was eventually signed by President Barack Obama and became law.) We turned to the C-SPAN archives and the Congressional Record to nail down exactly what happened that day.\nAt 6:30 p.m., the Senate was in the aftermath of a vote.

Taking up the cause on\u00a0Fox News Sunday\u00a0was 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney.\n\"You've seen in polls and in discussions across the country a feeling that Hillary Clinton is just not trustworthy,\" Romney said April 12, 2015. \"This whole story about her having erased all of her emails even though they were subject to recall and review by Congress, I think that's made people remember that with the Clintons, it's always something.\"\nWe have dissected before the web of\u00a0laws and regulations\u00a0that surround Clinton\u2019s use of a private email account as Secretary of State. For this fact-check, we look at Romney\u2019s claim that she erased all of her emails when they should have been kept for use by Congress.\nA review of the facts shows Romney had a point, but he mangled the details.\nA quick recap\nIn March, the public learned that instead of using a State Department email account when she was in charge, Clinton ran all of her email through a private\u00a0server in her New York home. When State Department officials asked for copies of her government-related emails late last year, Clinton\u2019s staff went through her files and sent over about 30,000. According to Clinton, about an equal number of emails\u00a0were judged to be personal and were erased.\nSpecific to Romney\u2019s statement that Clinton erased all of her emails, there is no question that she preserved and delivered thousands to the State Department.\nClinton has said that all of this was in line with federal regulations. We have found that it isn\u2019t so cut and dried.\nThe\u00a0National Archives and Records Administration\u00a0(NARA)\u00a0oversees federal recordkeeping, and its code requires federal agencies to keep records that document agency activity\u00a0so that they are readily available when needed -- such as for Freedom of Information Act requests or congressional inquiries.\nHowever, not all records need be retained.\u00a0Agencies have the discretion\u00a0to delete material that is deemed to have no value.\nThe laws are tighter today than when Clinton was secretary, but even during her tenure, her sole reliance on a private email account skirted the law, experts tell us.\n\"The key thing is that while use of a personal account was not prohibited, exclusive use of it was,\" said Daniel Metcalfe, professor of law at American University and former director of the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Information Policy.\nWith a State Department email account, all of Clinton\u2019s emails would have been stored on a government computer. Any researcher or government body would then have access, pending the normal privacy and security reviews.

{"label": "false", "claim": "Mary Matalin \"For the last decade the climate has been cooling.\"", "evidence": "Skeptics of climate change often say the world has been cooling in the past decade.\n\nConservative pundit Mary Matalin made that claim on CNN's  Situation Room  on Oct. 22, 2009. Matalin warned that the Obama administration is pushing too many big legislative initiatives such as a cap-and-trade plan to slow global warming when the administration should be focusing on the deficit.\n\n\"If they care about reducing the deficit, which should be their No. 1 priority ... they're not going to be able to do this \u2014 all this other nonsense, cap and trade and all the rest of it. Too much, too fast,\" Matalin said. \"Climate change is a fake issue anyway. ... There is not consensus science on what is causing global climate change. There is climate change, but for the last decade the climate has been cooling. There is the science. There is the data on that. They want to do this because they like to have all these programs being controlled by the government.\"\n\nSo, Matalin acknowledges that the Earth's temperature is changing, but she's not so sure that those changes are man-made. We'll save the debate over whether climate change is caused by human activity for another day. For now, we're going to check Matalin's claim that the Earth has been cooling in recent years.\n\nLast spring, we checked  a similar claim  made by the Cato Institute, a free-market think tank. The group claimed that there has been no net global warming for over a decade; we found that False because the climate scientists we spoke with said that, while temperatures have remained relatively static over the last decade, very little can be learned about climate change in a 10-year window.\n\nMatalin's office sent us a few articles pertaining to the issue,  two   about  a new book by Christopher Booker, a British author and climate change skeptic, who wrote in the Oct. 25 issue of the British newspaper the  Telegraph  that, \"as the world has already been through two of its coldest winters for decades, with all the signs that we may now be entering a third, the scientific case for (carbon dioxide) threatening the world with warming has been crumbling away on an astonishing scale.\"\n\nAnother study  , published by Bob Carter, a professor of geology at Australia's James Cook University, in the Jan. 20 issue of the  Australian  newspaper argued that \"global atmospheric temperature reached a peak in 1998, has not warmed since 1995 and, has been cooling since 2002.\"\n\nCarter is correct that global temperatures hit a high point in 1998. Several entities \u2014 including NASA, the Climate Research Unit in the United Kingdom and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States \u2014 track temperature changes. Generally speaking, their records show that 1998, a year when a warming pattern called El Nino ruled the weather, is the hottest we've had since scientists started collecting temperature information in the mid 1800s. NASA, on the other hand, pins 2005 as the hottest year on record.\n\nBut no matter how you slice the data, temperatures have indisputably fluctuated in the last decade, contrary to Matalin's suggestion that they have cooled.  This graph  from NASA shows that the temperature increased slightly between 2000 and 2001, dropped in 2002, and rose once again the following year. In this case, the annual mean temperature goes up and down, and the five-year mean is on a steady rise.  This graph  from NOAA shows a similar trend, with temperatures dipping slightly at the beginning of the decade and peaking once again in 2005.\n\nWe asked Richard Heim, a meteorologist at the NOAA National Climatic Data Center Climate Monitoring Branch, what to make of all these ups and downs.\n\nAt the most, it shows a plateau, he said. But certainly not a cooling trend.\n\n\"With climate change, not every year is going to be warmer,\" Heim said. \"It's two steps up, two steps down \u2014 that's not a indication we're on a massive cooling trend.\"\n\nNOAA climate monitoring chief Deke Arndt recently  told the Associated Press  the same thing:\n\n\"The last 10 years are the warmest 10-year period of the modern record,\" he said. \"Even if you analyze the trend during that 10 years, the trend is actually positive, which means warming.\"\n\nIf 1998 is the starting point, a year many climate skeptics tend to cite, everything looks cooler in comparison, said Raymond Bradley, a climate scientist at the University of Massachusetts. He also pointed out that, when evaluating the impact of climate change on temperature, it's misleading to look at only the last 10 years.\n\nA decade is such a small period of time that \"it's like saying, 'It was cold here last week. What happened to climate change?'\" Bradley said.\n\nIt's a point we heard repeatedly from the climate experts we interviewed. They all agreed that, while climate temperatures may dip from year to year, it's shortsighted to say changes within a decade mean that climate change is going away.\n\n\"If you just take a one-year comparison \u2014 say that it's cooler in 2008 than it was in 2007 \u2014 that's an improper use of statistics\" to make judgments about climate change, said John Reilly, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"It still remains much warmer than it was in the 1960s. To the extent that there has been some slight cooling, we still remain half-a-degree above what it was then.\"\n\nIndeed,  climate   records  show that temperatures have been on the rise since the middle of the century, and that fluctuations between recent years are relatively small compared to overall increase. NASA estimates that global temperatures have risen a total of 2.3 degrees since 1895, and that 13 of the warmest years since 1850 have occurred in the last 14 years.\n\nJim Hurrell, a senior scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., says these natural temperature variations are expected.\n\n\"In the same way that El Nino made 1998 warm, in 2007 and 2008, La Nina made global temperatures a bit cooler than they have been running, but still much warmer than the long-term average,\" Hurrell said referring to El Nino's cooler counterpart.\n\nCiting just the last 10 years \"is a classic case of taking the data and letting it tell a very misleading story,\" he said.\n\nMatalin said, \"for the last decade the climate has been cooling.\" That suggests there has been a distinct reversal of the steady warming that scientists have documented for many years. But a review of the data shows that's not the case. The numbers show that in the past 10 years, global temperatures have not continued their sharp increase. But they have not cooled either. In fact, some years in the last decade have been hotter than the previous years. At most, they could be described as hitting a plateau. But they haven't cooled as Matalin said"}
{"label": "false", "claim": "Dennis Richardson Says Oregon state employees received a \"catch-up\" pay raise in 1981 -- just two years after they agreed not to take a raise in exchange for a retirement benefit.", "evidence": "The Public Employees Retirement System is the topic that never quits doling out potential PolitiFacts. On the final day of the 2011 legislative session, for example, Rep. Dennis Richardson, R-Central Point, had this to say about failed efforts to get public employees to start paying the 6 percent \"employee share\" that public employers (otherwise known as taxpayers) have been paying since 1979.\n\n\"In 1979, there was a collective bargaining agreement that said, \u2018No pay increases but we'll pick up the 6 percent as the employer on the retirement plan.' In 1981, the negotiators for collective bargaining said, \u2018We haven't had a raise in four years,\u2019 and so they ended up with a 15.3 percent increase in pay, but the 6 percent payment toward the retirement plan didn't get repealed.\"\n\nIn a follow-up e-mail to The Oregonian, he said that the 6 percent pickup should have been repealed with the 15.3 percent pay increase, \"but it was allowed to continue on top of the \u2018catch-up\u2019 pay increase.\"\n\nRichardson\u2019s assertion is significant because it could undermine a key argument made by public employees, who say they are entitled to the pickup because it was given to them in lieu of a raise. If they got a larger-than-usual raise to make up for no raise, as he claims, shouldn\u2019t they forfeit the other benefit?\n\nMany taxpayers might think so. But how correct are the representative\u2019s facts?\n\nRemember that the late 1970s and early 1980s were a time of severe economic stress. Inflation was in the double-digits, and cost-of-living raises for those lucky enough to have a job were similarly high.\n\nRichardson is right that in May 1979, the state agreed to start paying the 6 percent retirement pickup previously withheld from employees\u2019 paychecks.\n\nBut he\u2019s not right that employees agreed to no pay increases in that contract negotiation, which covered July 1979 through June 1981. The labor agreement called for employees who made just under $12,000 a year to receive a 1 percent salary increase on July 1, 1979. Additionally, \u00a0all employees were to receive a maximum 2 percent cost-of-living increase five times over two years, up to 10 percent.\n\nIn July 1981, a new state contract gave all workers a $55 monthly increase -- which Richardson calculates as an average 4.3 percent increase. We agree. They also agreed to cost of living increases totalling 11 percent from January 1982 to March 1983. A union spokesperson told The Oregonian at the time that the package would result in pay raises of 15.6 percent to 19 percent. This is what Richardson considers the \"catch-up.\"\n\nEmployees, however, did not get those raises as scheduled.\n\nState workers received the $55 monthly increase and a 2 percent COLA in January 1982, but a severe recession that year meant that employees had to wait until July 1983 for the rest of their cost-of-living increases, which totalled 9 percent. Furthermore, they didn\u2019t get COLA cost-of-living increases in 1983-85 because the economy was so bad.\n\nSo Richardson\u2019s facts are not entirely accurate. Still, we wanted to know whether the increases state employees did receive beat inflation. In other words, how generous was the state?\n\nEssentially, employees over 1979-81 received about a 16 percent \"wage\" increase, if you include the 6 percent retirement pickup. At the time, inflation was 25 percent -- or, to break it down, 14 percent in 1979, 13 percent in 1980 and 9 percent in 1981, adjusted for the state\u2019s fiscal year calendars.\n\nState employees continued to lag behind inflation with the next contract, even with the retirement pickup. The \"wage\" increase over 1979-83 was 22 percent, at a time when inflation was 33 percent. That\u2019s at least a a more than 10 percentage-point gap.\n\nThe gap narrowed a little more with the 1983-85 contract: \"Wages\" increased 31 percent while the cost of living went up 39 percent. By the 1985-87 agreement, state workers\u2019 wages had grown 39 percent since 1979 while the cost of living had gone up 43 percent. Again, that included the retirement benefit.\n\nIf your eyes are glazing over, jump to the ruling. For those who want more evidence, we asked Tom Potiowsky, Oregon\u2019s former state economist now at Portland State University, and Joshua Lehner, an economist with Oregon\u2019s Office of Economic Analysis, to check our math. They came to to the same conclusion, but used a slightly different time period.\n\nLet\u2019s start with a hypothetical $100 salary in June 1979. By July 1982 that $100 would be roughly $126 with the cost of living increases and 6 percent retirement money not being taken from paychecks. Inflation in the Portland-Salem area would have grown from $100 to $140, from 1978 to July 1982. So that\u2019s a 15 percentage point difference.\n\nBy July 1983, the $100 would have grown to $138 for state workers, and $144.50 under inflation. \"This narrowed the gap, so that while inflation rose 44.5% from 1978 to July 1983, state wages rose 37.6 percent,\" Potiowsky said in an e-mail. \"Wages still did not recover from inflation from 1978 to July 1983.\"\n\nPresented with our findings, Richardson said in an e-mail that we should look at private sector wages and the rate at which those grew -- or didn\u2019t -- over this period.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t necessary for our ruling either, but the idea piqued our curiosity. So we turned to the crack economists at the Oregon Employment Department, who were kind enough to generate data on wages, adjusted for inflation to 1985 dollars.\n\nAccording to Employment Department numbers, state government workers lost 1.7 percent of their earning power from 1979-85 while private sector workers lost 3.9 percent. Again, this does not include the 6 percent pickup contribution. (But if you look at the graph, which charts a longer period, you\u2019ll see that everyone did poorly. Private sector wages declined less because they were lower to start with and they didn\u2019t drop as much as state worker wages. By the way, federal employees fared best.)\n\nThe Ruling:\nSo, did state employees make out like bandits? That\u2019s a matter of opinion. Readers can decide for themselves whether they did, and whether they should continue to get their retirement contributions paid.\n\n"}

Almost overnight, the future of the popular attraction became a key issue in the April 5, 2016 election between Abele and challenger Chris Larson, a Democratic state senator.\nLarson calls the three-dome complex a county treasure and vows to keep the facility running. Abele has been more open to a change, even suggesting residents may prefer something else, such as an amphitheater, to replace them.\nIn a March 3, 2016 interview on WISN-TV, Abele argued it is important to keep options open because the Domes are expensive to operate and not as popular as in past years.\n\"What most people don't know is that the Domes lose $1 million-plus each year,\" he said in the interview. \"The number of people going to the Domes has been going down.\"\nThat doesn\u2019t sound good.\nBut the county\u2019s own web site offers a different take.\n\"The Domes run an annual operating deficit averaging $630,000 per year, even as attendance has increased,\" it says, crediting creative programming. Indeed, that programming has taken place under Abele\u2019s watch.\nSo, which is right?\nLosing money\nUnlike a freestanding business, the Domes don\u2019t report a \"loss\" when expenses exceed revenue. Rather, the difference falls to county taxpayers.\nThe loss refers to how much in general property tax money it costs to keep the attraction open, above and beyond admissions and space rental fees (and after expenses).\nCounty figures show that going back five years, taxpayer support has ranged from a low of $386,803 in 2015 to a high of $1.11 million in 2014. That was the only year the loss topped $1 million, undermining the \"each year\" part of Abele\u2019s claim.\n\n"}

{"label": "half-true", "claim": "James Langevin \"Under the Obama administration, we are drilling and producing more domestic energy supplies than we ever had before.\"", "evidence": "The concern that the United States is not producing enough energy, resulting in high fuel prices, has been one of the themes of the 2012 election season. It came up during the Oct. 9, 2012, Eyewitness News debate between Democratic U.S. Rep. James Langevin and Republican challenger Michael Riley.\n\nLangevin, asked about energy, said the United States should tap whatever natural resources it can, but added, \"The reality is that the United States doesn't have enough of the world's energy supplies to make a real appreciable difference in controlling or bringing down our energy costs.\n\n\"Under the Obama administration we are drilling and producing more domestic energy supplies than we ever had before and it really hasn't had much of an impact on bringing down energy prices,\" he said.\n\nWe hadn't heard that the United States is producing more energy than ever before. We decided to see if it was true.\n\nWe asked the Langevin campaign for the source of the candidate's claim.\n\nHis communications director, Jonathon Dworkin, responded by e-mail that, \"The Congressman misspoke when he said 'ever,' as he realized after the debate.\"\n\n\"His point was that during the Obama administration, domestic drilling had increased significantly from the years before he took office, going back either 8 or 25 years depending on what you want to measure,\" said Dworkin.\n\nHe sent us a statement from the U.S. Department of the Interior asserting that domestic oil production is at an eight-year high and an Aug. 27, 2011, chart from The Wall Street Journal showing that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States had risen to 1,069, the highest level since at least 1987, according to data from the oil services company \u00a0Baker Hughes Inc.\n\nWe also looked at some of the statistics from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and found that the United States has a long way to go before producing more oil than it ever has.\n\nU.S. production of crude oil peaked at nearly 3.52 billion barrels in 1970. In 2011, production was 2.07 billion barrels. That's about 41 percent below the peak. Production bottomed out at 1.83 billion barrels in 2008 -- the last year of the George W. Bush administration -- and has subsequently risen 13 percent. July production was 194 million barrels; aside from last March, that's the highest since May 1998.\n\n(Many people assume that when you produce more oil, it lowers prices at the gasoline pump. But the Associated Press compared EIA data on domestic oil production with gasoline prices over the past 36 years and found that there was no link.)\n\nBut although Langevin's spokesman sent us information about oil prices, Langevin's debate statement was more general, encompassing all energy supplies.\n\nWe found that if you look at all fossil fuels, not just crude oil, part of Langevin's statement was correct.\n\nThe United States produced 60.1 quadrillion British thermal units of fossil fuel energy in 2011, more than any year in the EIA database going back to 1949, according to the agency's latest data, which is preliminary. (Using the BTU scale allows a comparison between different types of energy.)\n\nFossil fuel production is higher than ever before because coal production has been rising steadily (except for the past few years) and natural gas production has increased dramatically, in part because companies are using the controversial technique of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, to pull more gas from the ground.\n\nHowever, Langevin's statement saying that this happened \"under the Obama administration\" suggests that the administration was responsible for this trend.\n\nAs we have stressed in the past, market forces play the biggest role in determining energy production. In this case, high prices for fossil fuels have encouraged production.\n\nOur Ruling\n\nU.S. Rep. James Langevin, during a discussion that touched on energy policy, said, \"Under the Obama administration, we are drilling and producing more domestic energy supplies than we ever had before.\"\n\nCrude oil production in the United States has, in fact, risen recently after a 38-year decline but it is far from its historic high.\n\nHowever, overall fossil fuel production is the highest it\u2019s ever been, thanks mostly to a sharp increase in natural gas production since 2005.\n\nLangevin may have thought he misspoke, but he actually had the larger trend right.\n\nWhat he got wrong was the suggestion that the Obama administration was responsible when, in fact, the role of any administration in such matters is usually limited.\n\nBecause the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.\n\n(Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter: @politifactri.

{"label": "true", "claim": "Donald McEachin Gov. Bob McDonnell\u2019s\u00a0budget plan\u00a0takes\u00a0\"money out of our classrooms to pave roads.\"", "evidence": "Democrats say\u00a0Gov. Bob McDonnell wants to take money away from public schools and spend it on roads.\n\nAt issue is the Republican governor\u2019s proposal to increase the share of the state\u2019s sales tax that is earmarked for road maintenance from .5 percent of a purchase to .55 percent. McDonnell says it would generate an extra $110 million for highway upkeep over the two-year budget cycle that starts July 1.\n\nThat would be the first step of an eight-year plan by the governor to gradually increase the road maintenance share of the sales tax to .75 percent. \u00a0\n\nThe General Assembly will vote on the measure this winter and Democrats -- who are a minority in the House and, arguably, in the Senate -- are vowing stiff opposition. The governor\u2019s proposal amounts to \"taking money out of our classrooms to pave roads,\" Sen. Donald McEachin, D-Henrico, said Jan. 11 in the Democratic response to McDonnell\u2019s State of the Commonwealth address.\n\nIs McEachin right? Let\u2019s start with a little background.\n\nThe state has a 5 percent sales tax, or five cents on every $1 of purchase. As we\u2019ve noted, a half-penny of that levy goes to highway maintenance. But the lion\u2019s share -- the remaining 4.5 cents, helps support the state\u2019s general fund, which pays for education, health programs and public safety.\n\nThe general fund is expected to amass $34.6 billion over the two-year budget cycle starting July 1. McDonnell, in keeping with recent budget standards, has proposed that almost 30 percent of the fund -- $10.3 billion -- be spent in classrooms.\n\nNow, let\u2019s return to McEachin. Our calls to him were referred to the Virginia Senate Democratic Caucus. We spoke to two caucus officials: Steve Pazimino, the executive director, and Katie Mulhall, the press secretary. They justified McEachin\u2019s claim with this contention: It is impossible to take an additional portion of the sales tax out of the general fund without impacting education.\n\nMcDonnell, over the next two years, would divert $110 million traditionally earmarked for the general fund and spend it on transportation. Schools would lose about a 30 percent share of that money, or $33 million. That comes to about three-tenths of 1 percent of the money the state spends in classrooms. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nAnd remember, that would be the first step in McDonnell's eight-year plan. There would likely be at least a fivefold increase in the numbers as the portion of the sales tax dedicated to road repairs gradually increased from .5 percent to .75 percent.\n\nTucker Martin, McDonnell\u2019s chief of communications, told us there are many programs supported by the general fund. The inference is that Democrats are oversimplifying when they say moving money away from the general fund means moving it away from education.\n\nBut McDonnell\u2019s proposal does not identify any general fund programs that would be specifically cut to compensate for the loss of sales tax revenue. The governor\u2019s plan does not protect schools -- or any other general fund service -- from the small fallout.\n\nOur Ruling:\n\nMcEachin, speaking on behalf of Democrats in the General Assembly, said McDonnell\u2019s proposed budget would take \"money out of our classrooms to pave roads.\"\n\nHe was referring to an eight-year plan by McDonnell plan to gradually increase the small portion of state sales revenues earmarked for road maintenance. The governor\u2019s proposal would remove $110 million from the state\u2019s general fund during the next two budget years.\n\nAbout 30 percent of the general fund goes to classroom education, so schools stand to lose $33 million. The biennial school loss would grow to at least $165 million when McDonnell\u2019s plan was fully phased in.\n\nPut in context of the overall\u00a0state education budget -- McDonnell wants to spend $10.3 billion in classrooms over the next two fiscal years -- the loss does not seem catastrophic. But there is no doubt McDonnell\u2019s would narrow a guaranteed source of revenue to education without opening a new source"}

The NRSC\u2019s claims distort or ignore votes Peters has cast as a member of Congress and his own efforts to introduce and sponsor legislation to support veterans.\u00a0\nThe NRSC disagreed with the findings of this FactCheck and defended its claims. \"It is unfortunate that the Detroit Free Press is using Democrat talking points to carry water for Gary Peters\u2019 Senate campaign,\" said NRSC spokesperson Nathan Brand in response to a request for comment.\u00a0\nFunding for the VA\nThe NRSC points to instances when Peters voted against bills appropriating funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). But during his time both in the U.S. House and Senate, Peters has consistently supported the final passage of legislation funding the department.\u00a0\nThe NRSC noted that in 2015, Peters voted against ending debate on an appropriations bill that the American Legion and President Obama said underfunded the VA. But Peters ultimately supported the final bill, which included a significant increase in funding for the department from the previous fiscal year.\nThe NRSC also said that in 2016, Peters voted three times against shutting off debate on a conference report combining the House- and Senate-passed versions of an appropriations bill that would have restricted funding for family planning services. Preceding these votes, however, Peters supported the Senate-passed version of the bill that actually proposed a higher level of funding for the VA than the conference report.\u00a0\nAfter the conference report failed, the Senate considered another appropriations bill funding the VA that Peters voted against. Peters said he could not support the bill because it did not include any assistance for Flint residents during the city\u2019s water crisis.\u00a0\nThis was the second time Peters voted against a final appropriations bill funding the VA. In 2013, Peters \u2014 along with many Democrats \u2014 voted against a bill that contained large spending cuts across the U.S. government, including funding for implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\u00a0\nBesides these two votes, Peters has supported every appropriations bill funding the VA. During Peters\u2019 time in Congress, the VA budget has grown considerably.\u00a0\nVeterans housing programs\nTo support the claim that Peters fought against veterans housing programs, the NRSC points to Peters\u2019 participation in a group that aimed to reduce the government\u2019s deficit in 2010.

{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Robert Hagan Ohio taxpayers spent more than $67 million \"for the year\" on food stamps and Medicaid for Wal-Mart workers", "evidence": "In addition to its reputation for low prices, Wal-Mart is recognized by some as a company that puts profits ahead of its workers\u2019 well-being. State Rep. Robert Hagan, a Youngstown Democrat, capitalized on that distinction last month when he publicly chastised the megastore for all the public assistance its workers in Ohio receive.\n\nOhio taxpayers\u2019 contribution to public assistance for Wal-Mart workers was the focus of a Dec. 8 speech Hagan gave on the floor of the Ohio House of Representatives as he advocated for legislation he sponsored to shed light on employers with high number of workers on welfare. The bill failed that day, the last day of session.\n\nOhio taxpayers spent more than $67 million \"for the year\" on food stamps and Medicaid for Wal-Mart workers, Hagan said.\n\nHagan made clear he does not wish to reduce public assistance to those who need it. But he questioned why so many workers at Wal-Mart \u2014 which boasted $405 billion in sales last year \u2014 live in poverty and need Medicaid and food stamps.\n\nSpending on welfare programs, especially Medicaid, will be under the microscope this year as state officials confront a multibillion-dollar budget deficit. So PolitiFact Ohio decided to look more closely at Hagan\u2019s claim.\n\nWe checked with his office and were told the claim was based on a report the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services generated last year at Hagan\u2019s request.\n\nThe report listed companies on a monthly basis who employed the most workers receiving various forms of public assistance, including Medicaid and food stamps, from July 2008 to August 2009.\n\nHagan zeroed in on June 2009 for his attack on Wal-Mart, which topped the Medicaid and food stamps lists in the report nearly every month.\n\nAs we studied the report, we realized Hagan had to extrapolate certain figures to reach the conclusion that $67 million was spent on Medicaid and food stamps for Wal-Mart workers.\n\nDespite the overall fuzziness of Hagan\u2019s math, which we will attempt to clarify momentarily, he did nail one statistic in his formula: the number of Wal-Mart workers and their dependents on public assistance.\n\nThe Department of Job and Family Services tapped into its centralized system that caseworkers use to issue benefits and reported to Hagan that 15,484 Wal-Mart workers and dependents received Medicaid benefits in June 2009, and 12,872 Wal-Mart workers and dependents got food stamps.\n\nHagan then multiplied those totals by the average costs in June 2009 of Medicaid and food stamps per recipient. The resulting costs for June 2009 then were annualized to calculate the annual total.\n\nThis is what it looks like:\n\n$245 average cost (X) 15,484 recipients (X) 12 months = $45.5 million.\n\nHagan used the same formula and the same reports to figure the annual amount of food-stamp assistance Wal-Mart workers received.\n\n$142.40 average cost (X) 12,872 recipients (X) 12 months = $22 million.\n\nPut both figures together and you get $67.5 million.\n\nWhile the number matches Hagan\u2019s claim, it also has some problems.\n\nFirst, his cost-per-recipient figures are averages and are not specifically tied to the thousands of Wal-Mart workers on welfare.\n\nThe food-stamp average of $142.40 was derived from a Department of Job and Family Services report \u2014 separate from the one Hagan requested \u2014 that dissected public assistance spending in June 2009. The report showed more than $205 million in food stamp coupons were issued to more than 1.4 million people for an average of $142.40 per person.\n\nThe Medicaid average only accounts for only one type of Medicaid coverage, the Covered Families and Children program, which is most common among numerous types of Medicaid benefits. Using just the Covered Families and Children figure assumes all of Wal-Mart\u2019s recipients are on that plan.\n\nDepartment of Job and Family Services spokesman Ben Johnson said there\u2019s no way to tell what type of Medicaid coverage was applied to the more than 15,000 Wal-Mart workers and dependents who received assistance in June 2009.\n\nLastly, Hagan\u2019s math assumes the assistance Wal-Mart workers received in June 2009 is consistent each month for a year. A closer look at the report, which lists public assistance recipients on a monthly basis, shows little fluctuation in the number of recipients connected to Wal-Mart. But the monthly totals are never exactly the same.\n\nFor all those reasons, Johnson said Hagan\u2019s formulas produced an inexact figure to quantify the annual amount of public assistance Wal-Mart receives.\n\n\"We would certainly take issue with that premise,\" Johnson said.\n\nHagan\u2019s method is something PolitiFact Ohio and The Plain Dealer might try to get a ballpark figure when exact figures aren\u2019t available, but Hagan presented it as a precise figure. He later acknowledged his figures were not 100 percent exact, but said the goal of his failed legislation was to shed light on companies with thousands of workers on welfare.\n\nEven if Ohio taxpayers don\u2019t pay exactly $67 million in Medicaid and food stamps, it is clear they are subsidizing Wal-Mart\u2019s health care costs, Hagan said.\n\nSo where does Hagan land on the Truth-O-Meter?\n\n\nHe might have fared better if he had made his point by citing the number of Wal-Mart workers on welfare \u2014 an exact number at his fingertips \u2014 rather than swing for the fences by throwing out a juicy, and inexact, multimillion-dollar cost to Ohio taxpayers.\n\n\n\n\nWhile it is clear thousands of Wal-Mart workers and their dependents are on welfare, neither Hagan nor the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services knows the precise cost.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n"}

{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Barack Obama Says that since he took office, \"there have been no large-scale attacks on the United States.\"", "evidence": "President Barack Obama talked about terrorism and drones in a major speech on May 23, 2013.\n\nAt one point, Obama said \"there have been no large-scale attacks on the United States\" since the start of his presidency, adding, \"Now, make no mistake, our nation is still threatened by terrorists. From Benghazi to Boston, we have been tragically reminded of that truth. But we have to recognize that the threat has shifted and evolved from the one that came to our shores on 9/11.\"\n\nWe wondered whether he was accurate when he said \"there have been no large-scale attacks on the United States\" since his presidency began.\n\nWe were particularly interested in this question because we recently rated a claim by Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., that \"in barely four years in office, five jihadists have reached their targets in the United States under Barack Obama,\" compared to zero \"in over seven years after 9/11 under George W. Bush.\" We gave Cotton\u2019s claim a Mostly False, but that statement has important differences in wording that led us to take a look at Obama\u2019s claim as well.\n\nWe see two terrorist attacks during Obama\u2019s tenure that could be considered \"large scale.\"\n\nOne is the 2009 shooting at Fort Hood, Texas, that left 13 soldiers and civilians dead and more than two dozen others wounded. Nidal Hasan, a psychiatrist and major in the U.S. Army Medical Corps, is the only suspect and is now awaiting a military trial.\n\nThe other incident is the bombing at the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013, that killed three and injured more than 260. Officials are still determining the extent of the role played by Islamic extremism in the accused bombers\u2019 motivations. (We aren\u2019t including the Sept. 11, 2012, attack in Benghazi, Libya, because it didn\u2019t take place on the U.S. mainland.)\n\nThe White House argues that Obama is accurate because neither Fort Hood nor Boston qualify as coordinated attacks on the scale of the 9/11 attacks. The White House also notes that Obama mentioned both attacks elsewhere in his speech.\n\nSince the definition of \u2018large scale\" is in the eye of the beholder, we reached out to terrorism experts for guidance. They saw two key yardsticks for determining whether an attack is \"large scale.\"\n\nWas the plot connected to a broad terrorist network?\n\nA plot can be \"large scale\" if it is logistically complicated and draws in resources from many directions.\n\nPrior to the Fort Hood shootings, the government intercepted at least 18 emails between Hasan and Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born cleric tied to al-Qaida. Hasan sought out al-Awlaki for support and inspiration, but other than that, there is scant evidence that the incident was planned and carried out by an international terrorist network.\n\nAs for the Boston attack, investigators are still trying to determine how much assistance, if any, either of the Tsarnaevs got from other terrorists. But for now, at least, no hard evidence has emerged.\n\nIn general, then, both Hasan and the Tsarnaevs are considered more akin to \"lone-wolf\" terrorists who self-radicalized, rather than people who carried out a terrorist attack devised by a larger terrorist gang.\n\n\"Without the direct involvement of a more organized group and in view of other elements, they are more difficult to qualify as large scale,\" said Mathieu Deflem, a sociologist specializing in terrorism at the University of South Carolina. They both involved \"lone-wolf perpetrators who lacked direct connections or instructions from an organized group.\"\n\nHow many were killed?\n\nThe attacks in Fort Hood and Boston both caused more deaths than several other terrorist attacks on U.S. soil, including a 2002 shooting at the Los Angeles airport \u00a0(two killed), a 2006 vehicular attack at the University of North Carolina (injuries only) and a 2009 shooting at a U.S. Army recruiting center in Little Rock, Ark.

The Clinton campaign vehemently denied it.\n\"Of course Hillary Clinton does not want to repeal the Second Amendment,\" Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin said.\nWe found no evidence that Clinton has ever advocated for repealing or abolishing the Second Amendment. Schwerin\u2019s comments are largely consistent with what Clinton has said in the past few years about the right to bear arms.\nHowever, gun rights advocates argue that it\u2019s reasonable to infer from a few of Clinton\u2019s comments that she wants to roll back the Second Amendment as it\u2019s currently interpreted.\nStraight shooting on the campaign trail\nIn both her 2008 and 2016 White House bids, Clinton has called for stronger background check requirements all the while affirming her support for the right to bear arms.\nClinton does want to keep guns out of the hands of \"people we all agree shouldn't have them \u2014 domestic abusers, violent felons, and dangerously mentally ill people,\" said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Violence.

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Hillary Clinton The Great Recession emerged \"in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.\"", "evidence": "During the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton tried to fix blame for the Great Recession on a cherished part of conservative economic policy -- tax cuts.\n\"Trickle-down did not work,\" Clinton said, referring to a derisive name for tax cuts that dates from the presidency of Ronald Reagan. \"It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009. Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn\u2019t worked.\"\nLater in the debate. Clinton doubled down on that argument, saying, \"Well, let\u2019s stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago. We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.\"\nWe had usually heard from experts that the Great Recession stemmed most directly from the bursting of a housing bubble that led to a financial-sector meltdown. So we wondered whether economists thought Clinton\u2019s argument held water.\nFirst, some history: President George W. Bush enacted two rounds of tax cuts, though critics said that richer Americans benefited disproportionately. It is these cuts -- coming on top of previous rounds of tax cuts for wealthier Americans -- that play a prominent role in Clinton\u2019s assertion at the debate.\nMost, though not all, of the economists we contacted -- liberals, conservatives and in between -- expressed skepticism about the linkage Clinton made. (For their part, our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker gave the claim Three Pinocchios out of a possible four, in large part based on the analysis of a 663-page report from 2011 by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission.)\nThat said, when we contacted the Clinton campaign, they stood by the assertion. Two of the campaign\u2019s arguments stand out as plausible:\n\u2022 Bush administration regulators took their eyes off Wall Street.\n\u2022 Bush\u2019s tax and budget policies fostered income inequality that, in turn, promoted unsustainable investments by the wealthy in homes owned by families with stagnating income and uncertain abilities to pay them back.\nWe found one expert who strongly sided with Clinton\u2019s analysis -- Robert S. McElvaine, a historian at Millsaps College who has written about the Great Depression and the Great Recession. (The Post\u2019s Fact Checker found a couple more that had been put in touch through the campaign.)\n\"It\u2019s not the tax cuts for the rich per se, but their effect of concentrating income at the very top that was the major cause of the Great Depression,\" and, in turn, the Great Recession, McElvaine said. When income is too concentrated, he said, the rest of the population doesn\u2019t have enough to maintain sufficient demand, and the economy suffers, he said.\nSo there is at least some support for a lack of Wall Street regulation and income inequality for setting the stage for the financial crisis that spawned the recession.\n\n"}
{"label": "false", "claim": "Michele Bachmann Ezekiel Emanuel, one of President Obama's key health care advisers, \"says medical care should be reserved for the nondisabled. So watch out if you're disabled.\"", "evidence": "Update: After we published this item, Ezekiel Emanuel responded at length to these claims in an interview with ABC News. See the interview\n\nhere\n\n.\n\n\n\nYou know Rahm Emanuel, President Barack Obama's intense chief of staff. And maybe you've heard of his brother, Ari Emanuel, a Hollywood talent agent who provided the inspiration for the Ari Gold character on HBO's\n\nEntourage\n\n. Now a third Emanuel brother, Ezekiel Emanuel, has been thrust into the spotlight.\n\n\nEzekiel Emanuel is a health policy adviser at the White House Office of Management and Budget, and is a member of the Federal Council on Comparative Effectiveness Research, but until last week, he had largely flown under radar of the national political media.\n\n\nThat changed when Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., made a statement from the floor of the House on July 27 in which she said the American public needed to know what the people who advise Obama about health care reform think. Specifically, she said, Dr. Emanuel \"says medical care should be reserved for the nondisabled. So watch out if you're disabled.\"\n\n\nEmanuel is a well-known oncologist and bioethicist, which means he ponders such moral questions as \"You have three people who need a liver, but you've got just one liver, who gets it?\"\n\n\nLike other academics (see our article on claims about science czar\n\nJohn Holdren\n\n), Emanuel has found that highbrow articles for academic journals make great fodder for opponents trying to score political points. Academics often write theoretically about ideas that are being kicked around. And they repeat and explore those ideas, without necessarily endorsing them.\n\n\nBachmann's comments from the House floor substantially repeat claims made in a July 24, 2009,\n\nNew York Post\n\nop-ed piece written by Betsy McCaughey, former lieutenant governor of New York.\n\n\nUnder the headline, \"Deadly Doctors: O Advisers Want to Ration Care,\" McCaughey argues that \"Emanuel wants doctors to look beyond the needs of their patients and consider social justice, such as whether the money could be better spent on somebody else.\n\n\n\"Many doctors are horrified by this notion; they'll tell you that a doctor's job is to achieve social justice one patient at a time.\n\n\n\"Emanuel, however, believes that 'communitarianism' should guide decisions on who gets care. He says medical care should be reserved for the nondisabled, not given to those 'who are irreversibly prevented from being or becoming participating citizens. . . . An obvious example is not guaranteeing health services to patients with dementia.' (Hastings Center Report, Nov.-Dec. '96).\n\n\n\"Translation: Don't give much care to a grandmother with Parkinson's or a child with cerebral palsy.\"\n\n\nBachmann quoted heavily from McCaughey's op-ed in her floor statement, and sprinkled in her own two cents.\n\n\nHere's what Bachmann said:\n\n\n\"The president's adviser, Dr. Emanuel, believes communitarianism should guide decisions on who gets care. He says medical care should be reserved for the nondisabled. So watch out if you're disabled.\"\n\n\nShe noted, \"We just lost my father-in-law to dementia two months ago. I thank God that the doctors were able to alleviate my poor father-in-law's symptoms at the end of his life at age 85. Apparently, under the Democrats' health care plan, my father-in-law would not have received the high quality of care that he received in his last two months of life. Or if you're a grandmother with Parkinson's or a child with cerebral palsy, watch out.\"\n\n\nThe quote in question comes from an essay Emanuel wrote for the\n\nHastings Center Report\n\nin the November-December 1996 issue. It ran under the title, \"Where Civic Republicanism and Deliberative Democracy Meet.\" The title alone should give you an idea of the kind of academic, philosophical discussion that will ensue.\n\n\nIn the article, he addresses the idea of what's good for society at large when it comes to allocating health care resources, and that it \"suggests the need for public forums to deliberate about which health services should be considered basic and should be guaranteed.\" Under that philosophy, he writes, health services would be guaranteed to ensure the health of future generations as well as for \"full and active participation by citizens in public deliberations.\"\n\n\n"}

Even though the original result has been validated by a hand-count sample audit and a forensic audit of tabulation equipment that found no abnormalities, this ongoing Maricopa audit was ordered up by Republican state senators.

Rather, it was a series of votes on measures that the House supported but that the Senate and President Obama opposed, that had the predictable effect of shutting down the government. In the House, Republicans controlled\u00a0which measures get brought to the floor for a vote.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of House votes from that time period:\n\n\nPre-shutdown, votes 478, 497, 498 and 504: These votes took place on the budget in late September and were in support of the House Republican budget, which fully funded the government but defunded Obamacare or delayed its individual mandate. While Ellmers\u2019 votes were in favor of GOP budget proposals, they were made knowing that Obama had said he would veto the legislation if it hit his desk, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown.\n\n\nRule changes, vote 505: In the early hours of Oct. 1, as the shutdown began, House Republicans voted to alter the rules to make it impossible for an individual legislator to force a vote on reopening the government.\n\n"}

The bills are attracting much interest after the Jan. 8 shooting in Arizona that killed six and injured Democratic Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. One of the bills, Senate Bill 432 sponsored by state Sen. Greg Evers, R-Crestview, aims to prevent doctors from asking patients questions about their access to firearms and makes violations a felony punishable by up to a $5 million fine.\n\nDoctors argue against the proposed law. It also would prohibit physicians from refusing to see patients who won't answer questions about guns and bans the medical staff from writing down information about patients and their guns. This bill, then, is a battle between the gun lobby and the doctors' lobby, two powerful groups in Tallahassee.\n\nThis Truth-O-Meter isn't going to weigh in on the argument about gun control.

Hammer said she gave the Herald a one-page document called \"Firearms Accidents Facts\" compiled by the Unified Sportsmen of Florida in June 2010. The document compares accidental death by firearms to other types of accidents -- from choking to tricycles -- both nationally and in Florida. The Unified Sportsmen of Florida is the state's affiliate of the NRA.\n\nThe fact-sheet includes comparisons to accidental deaths by \"medical misadventures\" -- both in raw numbers and in rates per capita -- but doesn't specify the year. Medical misadventures, the handout says, \"is a term used by some statisticians to cover 'accidents' by doctors and other medical personnel.\"\u00a0Note that this claim\u00a0covers only gun accidents -- it doesn't include firearm deaths due to murder or suicide.\n\nAccording to the sheet:\n\n\u2022 Nationally, \"4 times more die from 'medical misadventures' \" than firearms.\n\u2022 In Florida, \"6 times more die from 'medical misadventures' \" than firearms.\n\nHammer on Jan. 17 directed us to Mark Overstreet, NRA Institute for Legislative Action research coordinator. He told us that the figures -- compiled by the NRA for Hammer -- were from 2007. He pointed us to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WISQARS (Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System) -- an interactive database that provides customized reports.\n\nThe death data is compiled by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. This\u00a0information comes\u00a0from death certificates filed in state vital-statistics offices and includes causes of death reported by attending physicians, medical examiners and coroners, according to the CDC. All of the states comply with providing this data.\n\nFirearm accident data\n\nOn the WISQARS website, we searched Fatal Injury Reports 1999-2007 for \"unintentional,\" \"firearms,\" \"2007\" and \"United States.\" That produced a chart that showed 613 deaths in the U.S. for 2007.\n\nThen we queried the same data for Florida and found 16 deaths.\n\nCDC's\u00a0adverse effects data\n\nThe death data about medical care was far more complex. We'll walk you through the numbers and explain\u00a0why it doesn't provide a complete picture. We'll also discuss the \"medical misadventures\" label.\n\nOn WISQARS, we marked \"all intents\" and \"medical care, adverse effects\" for 2007 and saw 2,248 deaths nationwide. For Florida, the number was 108 deaths.\n\nWe thought those figures sounded awfully low for deaths as a result of medical errors. A 1999 study by the Institute of Medicine, \"To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System,\" concluded that medical error deaths range from about 44,000 to 98,000 a year.\n\nLet's summarize what we found before we delve into why the government's data is so low on such deaths:\n\nAccidental deaths 2007\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nationwide\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Florida\nFirearms\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 613\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 16\nMedical care adverse effects\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 2,248\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0108\n\nWhat the stats mean\n\nWe interviewed Robert N. Anderson, chief of mortality statistics at the CDC, to explain what the numbers mean.\n\nThe deaths are coded by categories, and one category is indeed labeled \"misadventures to patients during surgical and medical care.\" Some examples are an unintentional cut, a foreign object accidentally left in the body during surgery, and contaminated medical substances.\n\nOther categories\u00a0included in \"adverse effects:\"\n\n\u2022 Breakdown or malfunctioning of a medical device.\n\n\u2022 \"Surgical and other medical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure.\" Anderson told us that refers to procedures such as a patient reacting badly to an organ transplant.\n\n\u2022 Complication of medical care, which was a significant factor even though the care (such as surgery) occurred more than one year prior to death. This is also often referred to as \"late effects,\" Anderson said.\n\nSo overall, \"medical care, adverse effects\" includes both errors and complications.\n\nHow many errors?\n\nWe asked Anderson: Are the majority medical errors?\n\n\"I\u2019m not sure,\" he wrote in an e-mail. \"Only a very few in adverse effects category are explicitly medical misadventures.\" He added, \"Just because a misadventure is not specified, doesn\u2019t mean that it didn\u2019t occur. My guess is that many ... (in some categories) are indeed medical errors, but have been characterized as complications.\"\n\nAnderson also explained a key limitation of the data: It is only as accurate as the information provided on the death certificates by doctors. The WISQARS system tabulates types of deaths based on the \"underlying cause of death.\" Suppose a man had heart disease and needed a heart procedure, a doctor punctured his artery during surgery and the patient bled to death. If the doctor reports the underlying cause of death\u00a0as heart disease, then it won't be counted in the \"medical care, adverse effects\" category.\n\nThe CDC offers another source of online data called the WONDER system, which tabulates if a cause of death was mentioned anywhere on the death certificate, even if it wasn't listed as the \"underlying cause.\" The most recent year we could look up for WONDER was 2006.\n\nThe WONDER database showed 22,116 deaths from \"medical care, adverse effects\" nationwide in 2006 and about 1,319 for Florida. Anderson acknowledges that even that figure is low.\n\nThe reason, according to Anderson: \"The physician who makes the error doesn't have any incentive to report it. Actually they have a disincentive to report it even though it's in the interests of medical care in general to have that information reported. ... We are at the mercy of the cause of death certifier and how thorough they are in their reporting of cause of death.\"\n\nAnderson said he personally finds some studies more believable than others -- for example he disagrees with counting all hospital infections as errors. But he says he agrees with the Institute of Medicine study that put the figure between 44,000 and 98,000 -- and says even though that study is from 1999, he believes little has changed since then.\n\nFirearm data is\u00a0 also uncertain\n\nAnderson also raised a concern with the firearm data, that self-inflicted gun deaths could be accidental or a suicide, and some could be mis-classified or labeled as \"intent undetermined.\"\n\nIt's worth repeating that the vast majority of firearm deaths are by suicide and murder -- only a small slice of firearm deaths are accidental. According to the WISQARS data, in 2007 there were 31,224 firearm deaths nationwide -- the largest category was suicide followed by murder. That total number of firearm deaths is many multiples higher than the CDC's count for \"medical care, adverse effects\" deaths.\n\nWe asked Hammer, why make the comparison solely on accidents?\n\n\"When doctors claim that they have a right to question children and the parents of children because they want to prevent deaths by accidents with firearms, the facts speak for themselves,\" Hammer said. \"There are a number of areas dealing with medical care over which they have some control that (doctors) should focus attention on.\"\n\nAnd Overstreet, the NRA researcher, defends the use of WISQARS data, even knowing its limitations.\n\n\"We are not looking to jack the numbers up,\" he said. \"We are saying this is what the federal government is reporting.\"\n\nAnderson doesn't disagree.\n\n\"With the data issues surrounding medical errors, it's a fairly difficult comparison,\" he said. However, \"I don't think they are off base. I don't think they are doing something making an invalid comparison. ... What they are basically doing is looking at the government's underlying cause data. They are not even saying it's a gross underestimate. They are being very conservative here.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\n"}
{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Thom Tillis Says a lack of transparency for small-dollar donations is the \u201csame thing\u201d as dark money", "evidence": "North Carolina\u2019s junior senator made national headlines this week for suggesting that different types of campaign donations have the same level of influence over elections.\nRepublican Thom Tillis offered comments during a March 10 committee meeting on the influence of money in federal judicial races, The Hill reported.\u00a0\nTillis noted that while donors who give large amounts to certain political committees have their identities concealed, so do people who donate small amounts to candidates. Video of the full meeting is on C-SPAN\u2019s website. (Tillis starts talking around the one hour and 25-minute mark.)\n\u00a0Here\u2019s part of what he said.\n\"We\u2019re talking about dark money ... In the weekend after the untimely death of Justice Ginsburg, my opponent through his campaign account raised $6 million over 48 hours. And that comes from a new tool that we have which I\u2019ll call \u2018Dem-money.\u2019 That\u2019s aggregation tools that give $50, $200, $250 below any sort of reporting limit that are doing the same thing.\nI don\u2019t hear anybody on the Democrats\u2019 side saying they want to get rid of those tools. So they\u2019re not suggesting a disarmament of both sides. They\u2019ve simply found another way to do exactly the same thing: people providing money to candidates and influencing elections.\"\nIs it true that small, aggregated donations are \"exactly the same\" as big dark money donations? Experts say this is an oversimplification.\nTillis is incorrect in saying the identities of people making small donations are kept secret. It\u2019s also a stretch to suggest a small-dollar donor can influence elections and candidates in the same way that a large, dark-money donor can.\n\"They\u2019re as far apart as they can be within the same category. It\u2019s less apples and oranges and more oranges and kumquats,\" said Brendan Quinn, outreach and social media manager for the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks election spending.\nComparing anonymous donations\nTillis has a point in one regard. There are some types of political donations for which laws don\u2019t require the identity of the donor to be disclosed. Here\u2019s an explanation.\nDonations to certain groups: The term \"dark money\" typically refers to political spending where the source of funds is unknown. Typically this spending is done by 501(c) nonprofits. Laws don\u2019t require these groups to disclose the names of their donors, and there\u2019s often no limit to how much a donor can give.\nSome of the biggest spending by these groups happens through donations to super PACs, which operate as independent expenditure-only committees and are not allowed to directly coordinate with candidates they support. While super PACs are required to disclose their donors, some nonprofits and shell companies can legally give unlimited amounts of money to those super PACs without having to tell the public where those funds came from.\nThe Center for Responsive Politics (CRP) reports that dark money accounted for $750 million in spending during the 2020 election. Meanwhile, fully transparent donations accounted for only 30% of all outside spending, which the center says is an all-time low.\nDonations to candidates: Candidates are required to disclose the identity of most of their donors. This includes people or businesses that donate things besides money, such as food or event venues.\u00a0\nHowever, federal and state laws don\u2019t require the same level of transparency for the smallest donations. At the federal level, candidates for Congress and the presidency are required to disclose the names of people who donate $200 or more. At the state level, rules for donation disclosures vary.\u00a0\n\nSmall-donor disclosure laws for each state are available on a map created by The National Institute for Money in Politics, a nonprofit group advocating for election transparency. Florida and Michigan have the strictest laws, requiring disclosures for donations of any size. North Carolina is also on the stricter end of the spectrum, requiring candidates to disclose donations of more than $50. New Jersey and Nebraska have looser rules, requiring information only on those who donate more than $300 or $250, respectively.\nDonations to intermediaries: Here\u2019s something Tillis overlooked in his comments. While candidates aren\u2019t required to report the identities of small-dollar donors, groups that process those donations are required to report them.\u00a0\nIf you donate $20 to a candidate, that candidate may not disclose your name or address in his campaign finance reports. However, if that candidate uses an \"intermediary or conduit\" to collect donations, that company will list your name in its report.\nPopular intermediaries are ActBlue for Democrats and WinRed for Republicans. (Tillis was likely referring to ActBlue when he mentioned \"Dem-money.\") While each group is classified as a political action committee by the Federal Election Commission, they have other accounts that serve only to facilitate donations.\u00a0\nIn other words, ActBlue and WinRed are middle-man platforms that provide a service like PayPal does for online purchases. Some pundits and politicians have gotten these facts wrong.\n\n"}

The suit challenges the Affordable Care Act, arguing that \"the ACA is unlawful\" and seeking to enjoin, or block, its operation.\nIf the plaintiffs\u2019 wishes are granted by the courts, then insurance companies would be able to deny coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. So the tweet raises a genuine issue.\nHowever, we wondered whether the state party\u2019s estimate of \"nearly 2.5 million Missourians\" was accurate. Could that many Missouri residents really \"lose their health care coverage\" if the lawsuit succeeds?\nNot really. The tweet relied on one estimate. However, it\u2019s not the only estimate out there -- and the other ones are lower.\nBuckle up for a wonky ride!\nWhere does the 2.5 million figure come from?\nWhen we checked with the Missouri Democratic Party, they pointed to a report published in April 2017 by the liberal Center for American Progress. The group found that 2,495,800 Missourians are living with a pre-existing condition.\nThis estimate leveraged the data in a broader study released by the Department of Health and Human Services in the waning days of the Obama administration. That study found that nationally up to 51 percent of non-elderly Americans have a pre-existing condition. (Americans age 65 and over are covered by Medicare, so they were excluded from the count.) Using Census data, the Center for American Progress took the HHS numbers and devised estimates for every state and congressional district.\nSo the tweet used a real number, and one that experts said was legitimate.\nHowever, it\u2019s not the only estimate out there -- and the other ones are lower.\nFor starters, the HHS study itself offered two definitions for \"pre-existing condition,\" and of those, the Center for American Progress chose the broader estimate.\n\n"}

We took a closer look at the earnings numbers for working women and found that Cruz\u2019s claim is off.\nThe statistic closest to the one Cruz mentioned is calculated by the Census Bureau -- the median wage or salary for workers who are paid through wages or salaries. The bureau breaks those figures down by gender and adjusts the figures for inflation in order to enable comparisons across time.\nIn 2008, the last year before Obama took office, the median for women was $28,574. By 2014, that had risen to $29,098 in inflation-adjusted dollars.\nThat\u2019s an increase of $524 over six years -- not a decline of $733, as Cruz said.\nSo Cruz is wrong using the most obvious benchmark. But he would have been on safer ground if he had said \"income\" rather than \"wages,\" as he intended to do, Phil Novack, a spokesman for Cruz, confirmed to PolitiFact.\nThe Census Bureau separately calculates inflation-adjusted median income by gender. By this measure, the figure for women in 2008 was $22,945. By 2014, that had fallen to $22,240 -- a decline of $705, which is close to what Cruz said.\n\n"}

{"label": "half-true", "claim": "David Dewhurst \"You\u2019ve got almost twice as many cops in New York City as you do on our entire border. That\u2019s nuts.\"", "evidence": "Asked whether Texas needs to follow Arizona\u2019s lead and enact a hard-line immigration law, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said in a May 12 interview with the Texas Tribune that he was more interested in \u201ca long-term solution\u201d to illegal immigration: securing the border.\u00a0Claiming the federal government had done \u201cvirtually nothing\u201d to address the situation, Dewhurst said border operations conducted by \u201clocal sheriff\u2019s departments, local police departments, the state and our federal partners\u201d had taught the following lesson: \u201cAt the end of the day, [even with] all of the technology in the world, you need people.\u201d\u00a0To emphasize his personnel point, Dewhurst compared the number of U.S. Border Patrol agents to the number of police officers in the nation\u2019s largest city, New York. \u201cYou\u2019ve got almost twice as many cops in New York City as you do on our entire border,\u201d Dewhurst said. \u201cThat\u2019s nuts.\u201dNutty, maybe.But does Dewhurst's statement reflect reality?Answering our query, his office provided figures from the New York Police Department indicating that it has about 34,500 officers and from U.S. Customs and Border Protection that the Border Patrol has about 19,100 agents on the northern and southern U.S. borders. The Border Patrol is part of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection division of the federal Department of Homeland Security.We checked, and those figures stand up. The website for the New York Police Department says the agency's \"current uniformed strength is approximately 34,500.\" And Steven Cribby, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said the Border Patrol numbers about 20,000 -- 17,000 of whom are stationed on the U.S-Mexico border. An additional 2,100 employees are on the border with Canada, with the rest patrolling coastal waters, primarily near Puerto Rico.\u00a0Counting only the border agents that work the southern and northern borders, the NYPD force is about 81 percent larger than the Border Patrol, almost twice the size, as Dewhurst says. (That calculation leaves out the Border Patrol agents who work coastal waters. If you add those, the New York force is 73 percent larger.)\u00a0We wondered, though, if it's reasonable to compare cops working the nation's biggest city to officers monitoring our international borders.\u00a0We put that question to several law enforcement and criminal justice experts, including Samuel Walker, professor emeritus of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. His assessment: \"The comparison of the NYPD and the Border Patrol is completely wrong, given their very different roles and working environments.\"\u00a0Walker's point, which we heard separately from other experts: The two organizations have dramatically different missions and environments. The New York Police Department responds to calls for service from the city\u2019s more than 8 million residents and numerous visitors, while fighting all kinds of crime, in a dense urban area. In contrast, the experts said, the Border Patrol has much narrower responsibilities, which they have to fulfill across vast spaces -- much of it sparsely populated.Since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, the agency\u2019s primary mission has been to prevent terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the country, Cribby said. Agents are also tasked with preventing undocumented immigrants from entering the country illegally and stopping drug and human trafficking along the border between the legal ports of entry.Even comparing staffing levels of different police departments can be tricky. The usual basis for comparison is the number of sworn officers per 1,000 residents. Those ratios vary widely across the country and even from city to city. Based on the most recent numbers available, New York's ratio in 2008 was 4.3 officers per 1,000 residents; the national rate was 2.5.\u201cIt\u2019s often like comparing apples to carburetors because there is so much difference in how departments use people,\u201d said Craig Fraser, director of management services for the Police Executive Research Forum, a nonprofit research and consulting group in Washington. In some cities, police officers do jobs that are performed by civilian personnel elsewhere. Some police departments have fewer officers because other local law enforcement agencies, like a sheriff\u2019s office, pick up slack.It's even trickier to compare agencies with such different duties as the Border Patrol and the New York Police Department, as Dewhurst did.So where does all of this leave his statement?The lieutenant governor accurately characterizes the relative sizes of two law enforcement agencies -- the Border Patrol and the New York Police Department. He may have a point that the border needs more federal agents -- though there is disagreement over whether more boots on the ground will prevent illegal immigration -- but comparing the size of that force to the cops in the Big Apple is not a valid way to prove it"}
{"label": "true", "claim": "John Boehner \"Our spending has caught up with us, and our debt soon will eclipse the entire size of our national economy.\"", "evidence": "In his response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on Jan. 25, 2011, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., warned that government spending has reached a tipping point.\n\n\"We face a crushing burden of debt,\" Ryan said. \"The debt will soon eclipse our entire economy and grow to catastrophic levels in years ahead.\"\n\nWe at PolitiFact and our colleagues at PolitiFact Ohio have both considered essentially identical claims from House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.\n\nThe most recent of those statements, which came during a speech in the House of Representatives on Jan. 5, 2011, was that \"our spending has caught up with us, and our debt soon will eclipse the entire size of our national economy.\"\n\nIn its most basic interpretation, the United States government\u2019s total debt at the start of the year was $14 trillion, according to the Treasury Department\u2019s interactive \"Debt to the Penny\" website.\n\nThe size of the United States economy, measured by the gross domestic product, or the value of all goods and services, was $14.745 trillion in the third quarter of 2010, the most recent quarter for which data is available. This number comes from the U.S. Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis databases.\n\nUsing these numbers, it would appear that the eclipse is about to start. But since GDP estimates are not as current as the debt numbers, we wanted to see how big the debt was at the end of the third quarter of 2010. Going back to Treasury\u2019s calculator, we got a debt figure of $13.668 trillion by putting the date at Oct. 31, 2010. That means $13.6 trillion in debt against a $14.7 trillion economy, which to us signals the onset of an eclipse.\n\nEconomists and analysts who are reading this by now are shouting, \"Wait!\" We understand.\n\nThere is an alternative measure of debt known as \"public debt,\" which does not include money in the Social Security trust fund or other amounts that the government owes itself. Using this measure instead, the debt-to-GDP comparisons are much smaller. By the end of 2010, public debt is projected to be 60.3 percent of GDP, and by the end of 2012, it's projected to be 66.6 percent. If current practices aren\u2019t changed, public debt will reach 90 percent of GDP in 2020, according to the Congressional Budget Office, whose figures were cited by President Barack Obama\u2019s national Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform in December.\n\nSome economists prefer to use public debt rather than gross federal debt, because the public debt will require real money to repay the lenders, which in turn would have a faster ripple effect in the private sector. But one measure \"isn\u2019t more 'right' than the other,\" Marc Goldwein, policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a middle-of-the-road budget-hawk group, told us last March. \"Boehner may be cherry-picking, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s misrepresenting in any way.\"\n\nEven if the smaller number -- public debt -- were to approach a total eclipse in a decade, \"to me, that counts as 'soon,'\" said Brian Riedl, a research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. That\u2019s because it can take five to 10 years for congressional decisions \"to turn the budget ship around,\" he said.\n\nWe'll note that these numbers have been growing for decades, roughly tripling since Jimmy Carter left the presidency. Under Ronald Reagan, debt as a percentage of GDP grew from 33.4 percent to 51.9 percent, and under George H.W. Bush, it grew from 51.9 percent to 64.1 percent. It declined under Bill Clinton, from 64.1 percent to 57.3 percent, before rising from 57.3 percent to 69.2 percent under George W. Bush. It's expected to soar during Obama's first four years from 69.2 percent to 100.8 percent.\n\nWe'll also note that these numbers could change over the course of the next two years, depending on economic conditions and policy choices. Still, we considered Boehner's statistics valid, and Ryan's formulation is equally solid"}
{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Donald Trump \"The United States has a massive trade deficit with Japan. It's anywhere from $69 billion to a $100 billion a year.\"", "evidence": "When President Donald Trump held a joint press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at his Mar-A-Lago resort, a Japanese journalist asked the leaders about trade between the two countries.\nTrump started his answer by saying, \"The United States has a massive trade deficit with Japan. It's anywhere from $69 billion to a $100 billion a year. That's massive by any standpoint.\"\nWhen we took a closer look, we found that the lower end of Trump\u2019s scale has some credibility, but not the upper end.\nFirst, let\u2019s look at the data for trade in goods alone. (This is not the most complete look at trade \u2014 more on that later.) But the figure for goods alone is the one that trade skeptics are more apt to cite, because it is more likely to paint the United States as getting the short end of the stick in bilateral trade.\nU.S. Census Bureau data shows that the U.S. deficit with Japan in goods has been consistent in recent years, from $67 billion to $69 billion. In 2017, it was $68.8 billion.\nThat figure is in line with the lower end of Trump\u2019s range, but it\u2019s well below the upper end of his range. In fact, the higher figure Trump offered is about 50 percent larger than the actual size of the deficit.\nThere\u2019s a more comprehensive figure that combines the deficit in goods and services. It makes Trump\u2019s point more inaccurate.\nThe United States tends to have a more favorable balance of trade in services, which includes sectors such as financial and insurance services, legal services, business consulting, and entertainment. Any goods-and-services deficit is usually smaller than the deficit in goods alone.\nAccording to Census Bureau data, the U.S. deficit with Japan in goods and services in 2017 was $56.1 billion.\n\nSo Trump offered an upper estimate that\u2019s almost twice as large as the actual goods-and-services deficit.\n\n"}

Actually, it\u2019s misleading on several points. (We were unable to reach the group that created the meme, the Other 98, a group that says it fights \"economic injustice, undue corporate influence and threats to democracy.\")\nOn the first point, Cruz and Rubio have levied strong opinions about Benghazi and Clinton for years, but it\u2019s a stretch to put Heller in the same category.\nTo cite just one example, Cruz in June 2016 responded to the release of the final report of the House Select Committee on Benghazi by issuing a statement that called it \"disturbing\" that the \"bureaucratic incompetence of the Department of State under Secretary Clinton contributed to the administration\u2019s willful blindness, as the pleas for help from our foreign service officers in Libya were routinely ignored.\"\nRubio, who like Cruz ran for president in 2016, also cast Benghazi as a shadow over Clinton\u2019s record. For instance, during a GOP primary debate in October 2015, Rubio said that Clinton \"got exposed as a liar\" during her day-long testimony before the Benghazi committee.

We found less rhetoric about Benghazi by Heller than by either Cruz or Rubio in our searches of Google, Lexis-Nexis and their respective Senate websites.\nFor instance, Heller issued a statement calling for \"thoughts and prayers\" for the victims the day after the attacks took place, and another one two days later specifically memorializing one of the victims, Tyrone Woods, who was a Nevada resident.

The Ohio Capital Blog recorded the event.\n\nAgriculture, Kasich said, \u00a0\"is the strongest industry in Ohio\" and \"the bedrock of the state of Ohio.\"\n\nWe've heard similar comments from others: Sen. Sherrod Brown (\"the state's No. 1 industry\"), the state Department of Agriculture (\"Ohio's No. 1 industry\") and the Farm Bureau itself (\"Ohio's top industry\").\n\nIt's a bipartisan claim.\n\nBut PolitiFact Ohio wondered what measure makes agriculture No. 1. Employment? Dollars generated? Taxes levied? Square footage?\n\nSo we called Kasich's office and the state Agriculture Department and asked for sources.\n\nBoth referred us to \"OHFOOD,\" for Ohio food, which is an annually updated economic model developed by Thomas L. Sporleder, the much-cited professor of agribusiness at The Ohio State University.\n\nThe model, by its own description, is designed \"to capture the inter-dependencies and linkages among various sectors and industries composing the complex economy of Ohio\" and \"specifically to provide estimates of the economic importance of the food and agriculture-related cluster, along with the general manufacturing and service sectors, of the Ohio economy.\"\n\nAgriculture Department spokeswoman Erica Pitchford Hawkins said the analysis is the most comprehensive study available of Ohio agribusiness, and we could find nothing comparable.\n\nThe most recent, from June 2012, uses data from 2010 gathered primarily federal and county level agencies, Sporleder said.\n\nIn 2010, the study found, the total food and agricultural cluster contributed 11.7 percent, or $105 billion, of Ohio's total economic output of $898.7 billion. The cluster's share of the gross state product of $477.7 billion was $51 billion, or almost 11 percent.\n\nOhio's gross state product improved by 1.3 percent from 2008 to 2010, the study said, while the portion attributed to the \"agrifood\" cluster increased about 30 percent.\n\nThe agrifood cluster accounts for 14 percent of Ohio employment, or about 1 of 7 jobs. It gained 1 percent from 2008 to 2010, a period when total employment declined about 3 percent.\n\nThere are some points worth noting:\n\nIn the OHFOOD study, the \"financial, legal and real estate\" cluster is listed as a larger private sector of the state economy than the agrifood cluster. Kasich's office, though, pointed out that the grouping of financial services, legal services and real estate activities is particular to the study. That grouping is not used by such agencies as the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nSporleder told us the cluster is grouped because \"it\u2019s all service related,\" but \"it\u2019s not a supply chain\" in the way food and agriculture is.\n\nThat leaves food and agriculture the biggest sector of the state economy.\n\n\"If you\u2019re only talking about commodities, that\u2019s not the case,\" Sporleder said, meaning the cluster is more than just farming. \"If you\u2019re talking wheat to flour to bread, you get the sector build-up. It\u2019s an interdependent supply chain.\"\n\nMore than just farming, the \"agrifood\" or \"agribusiness\" cluster also encompasses processing, wholesaling and retailing, and food services. As a group, it accounts for $3 billion of the gross state product in the OHFOOD mode.\n\nKasich described agriculture as the strongest industry in Ohio.

Barack Obama, D-Ill., delivered seven, a move that was matched by Hillary Clinton about a month later.\n\n\u2022 In 1988, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis released six years of returns.\n\u2022 In 2008, McCain released two years of returns, as Roberts said.\n\n\u2022 In 1980, Ronald Reagan offered up just one return.\n\nThere is a difference for incumbents and challengers. Ever since 1976, when Jimmy Carter became president, sitting presidents and vice presidents have released their taxes each year they are in office. By the time re-election rolls around, they have put at least four tax returns into the public record. Challengers generally match or exceed that.\n\nOur colleagues at Factcheck.org looked at this in July and found that since 1980, only two general election candidates have revealed no more than two years of tax returns. One was Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in 2008 and the other is Romney, who released his 2010 tax return and an estimate of 2011.\n\nWhen we contacted the DNC about this fact-check, they sent us a statement saying Romney should release more of his tax returns.

Bush had signed in 2001 and 2002.\"\nAfter a ditty about Middle Eastern wars, Stewart played a clip where Obama said he \"look(s) forward to engaging Congress and the American people in efforts to refine, and ultimately repeal, the AUMF\u2019s mandate.\"\n\"Wow, then you are lucky that Congress never does anything you ask, because otherwise you would be screwed right now,\" Stewart joked.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Obama\u2019s gotten flak on this: Associated Press reporter Julie Pace recently asked White House press secretary Josh Earnest about the \"irony in using as your legal justification for these airstrikes an authorization for military force that the President himself has called for repeal of.\"\nSo we wanted to check: Is Obama justifying his airstrikes using the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs, while arguing that he wants the same AUMF repealed?\nWhen can the president wage war?\nUnder the War Powers Act of 1973, the president has the power to wage war for 60 days before an AUMF or a declaration of war is needed from Congress. Obama authorized airstrikes in Iraq against ISIS on Aug. 7, so to carry out what Obama called a \"sustained counter-terrorism strategy\" against the Islamic State, he will need\u00a0some sort of legislation from Congress.\nThat\u2019s what Bush did in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Congress passed an AUMF that gave the Bush the power to use \"appropriate force\" against anybody behind the attacks. That\u2019s been understood to mean al-Qaida, and while the Islamic State used to be part of al-Qaida, they\u2019ve since split over ideological differences and spats over leadership. Congress passed another AUMF in 2002 authorizing the Iraq War.\nBut in his Sept. 10 speech about the Islamic State, Obama said, \"I have the authority to address the threat from ISIL,\" meaning he believes that attacking ISIS is permitted under an existing AUMF, either from 2001 or 2002.\nObama made a similar statement during a Sept. 7 Meet the Press interview, but in neither case has Obama explicitly said that he\u2019s using the 2001 or 2002 AUMF to justify his actions.\nOthers in the White House have been more clear\nOthers in his administration, though, have named the 2001 AUMF specifically. When Pace drilled Earnest on \"an AUMF he (Obama) wanted repealed,\" Earnest responded by calling it \"an AUMF that he (Obama) believes continues to apply to this terrorist organization that is operating in Iraq and Syria.\"\nVarious sources, included The New York Times and Time, have quoted a statement from a senior administration official provided to the media that specifically points to the 2001 AUMF as a justification for the U.S. airstrikes against ISIL.\n\n"}
{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Alberta Darling Says the 2011-13 state budget eliminates the structural deficit \"for the first time in decades.\"", "evidence": "Wisconsin Republicans have made much of the fact that their 2011-\u201913 budget eliminates the state\u2019s long-standing structural deficit.\n\nIndeed, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau says the budget would result in a surplus of $292 million. It\u2019s the first time the fiscal bureau has determined that a budget would result in such a surplus since the agency began the calculations for the 1997-\u201999 budget.\n\nRepublican Gov. Scott Walker and GOP lawmakers argued that previous administrations used one-time fixes, such as tapping special funds and the state\u2019s settlement in lawsuits against tobacco companies, to balance the budget.\n\nNow, Democrats say the Republicans are making a big assumption -- that their counterparts in Washington will allow a tax increase -- to make the budget picture look better than it really is.\n\nAnd therefore, that the claim of the structural surplus is bogus.\n\nAt issue is how the fiscal bureau handled one piece of its projection: The future reinstatement of the federal estate tax, which -- based on a formula -- brings some additional money to state coffers. Under current law, the estate tax is to kick in again in 2013.\n\nIf that happens, the fiscal bureau estimates it would mean $219 million more for the state over the course of the two-year budget.\n\nAssistant Minority Leader Donna Seidel, D-Wausau, argues the \"$219 million is contingent on Congress reinstating the estate tax, which clearly is a top platform point for the Republicans and is not going to happen.\"\n\n\"So clearly that\u2019s another piece of misinformation,\" Seidel told the Journal Sentinel editorial board July 5, 2011, arguing the structural surplus is closer to $75 million.\n\nWe\u2019ve tackled several recent statements on the structural deficit.\n\nThe first thing to remember is this: The two-year budget itself -- by law -- must be balanced when passed. The structural deficit measures the future imbalance between spending and tax revenue as laid out in state law. So you can have a balanced budget, but one built upon assumptions that are projected to result in a deficit later on.\n\nThat\u2019s part of what happened in the past, leading to structural deficits reaching as high as $2.8 billion for the 2003-\u201905 budget.\n\nWe rated a statement by Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, that the budget eliminated the structural deficit for the \"first time in decades\" as Mostly True. A statement on national TV by Walker that the worst structural deficit was two years ago was False.\n\nThe Fiscal Bureau bases its estimate on factors including expected costs (the spending side), projections of how much the state will collect in sales and income taxes (the revenue side) and other sources of money.\n\nIn this case, that includes what federal law says about the estate tax.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Republicans will push to keep the tax cuts in place -- they already won one extension of the Bush-era tax cuts under President Barack Obama in December of 2010. But Seidel argues it was wrong to include the return of them in the Fiscal Bureau\u2019s calculation.\n\nAssembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, who was with Seidel during the Journal Sentinel visit, agreed with the argument that the surplus isn\u2019t real.\n\n\"There is no surplus,\" he said.\n\nIndeed, as Seidel criticizes the inclusion as an assumption improperly made by the bureau, she is making her own assumption: That the extension of the tax cuts will continue.\n\nHow does the process work?\n\nAs a rule, the fiscal bureau does its calculations based on current law, according to Rob Reinhardt, a program supervisor with the agency. The report on the structural surplus did note the assumption as a footnote.\n\nIndeed, a similar estate tax assumption was used when the fiscal bureau calculated the structural deficit for the 2009-\u201911 budget prepared by Democrat Gov. Jim Doyle. The bureau\u2019s analysis put that budget\u2019s structural deficit at $2.511 billion.\n\nApplying Seidel\u2019s logic to that budget, estate tax revenue should have been subtracted -- and the deficit would have been even larger.\n\nIndeed, even if the federal estate tax return was removed from the state\u2019s 2011-\u201913 budget, there still would be a surplus, just a smaller one. Seidel noted this herself.\n\nSo where does this leave us?\n\nAs the GOP touts passage of a budget that doesn\u2019t include a structural deficit, Seidel claims the number is bogus because it is puffed up by $219 million -- based on current law that calls for the estate tax to go back into effect in 2010.\n\nBut the Legislative Fiscal Bureau calculated the budget the way it always has. They even footnoted the issue for clarity. The bureau\u2019s calculations are a picture in time -- where the budget stands today. With her own assumption, Seidel wants to jump to the future to undermine the nonpartisan calculation"}
{"label": "pants-fire", "claim": "WorldNetDaily \"California To Register Illegal Aliens To Vote \u2013 Automatically.\"", "evidence": "In April 2018, a new law will allow Californians to automatically register to vote when they renew their driver\u2019s license.\nIt\u2019s intended to bolster registration in a state where voter turnout has lagged.\nA slew of conservative websites, however, have seized on the law, dubbed the California New Motor Voter Program, to make the claim this week that it will register undocumented immigrants to vote.\nThey cite a separate law, AB 60, that allows undocumented Californians to apply for and obtain a state driver\u2019s license, as alleged proof.\nThis World Net Daily headline on Jan. 21, 2018 sparked the recent claims: \"California To Register Illegal Aliens To Vote \u2013 Automatically.\"\n\nShortly after it was published, similar allegations were made by The New American, FoxNews.com and conservative commentators Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh.\nThis isn\u2019t the first wave of commentary on the topic. Similar statements were made when California passed the Motor Voter program in 2015.\nBut because the claims popped up again this week, it\u2019s time to take another look at the California laws in question and the safeguards state officials say are in place.\nWe\u2019ll also place a rating on the claim by World Net Daily.\nBackground on the laws\nDemocratic Gov. Jerry Brown signed AB 60 in 2013, making California the 10th state to allow driver licenses for people in the country illegally. The goal was to increase public safety and reduce penalties for undocumented immigrants who drive. As of June 2017, the state Department of Motor Vehicles had issued more than 900,000 of the licenses.\nIn 2015, Brown signed the New Motor Voter law. By April, it will automatically register DMV customers to vote when they renew or obtain a driver\u2019s license or fill out change of address forms, unless the customer opts-out.\nUnder the law, the DMV would electronically send information for those eligible to register to vote -- which does not include undocumented residents -- to the California Secretary of State\u2019s Office. That office would, in turn, verify name and citizenship information. A spokesman for that office did not respond to requests for comment this week.\nIn the past, however, Secretary of State Alex Padilla has pledged the new system will be an improvement over the existing one.\n\"Automated voter registration is actually a more secure way of doing things,\" Padilla told the Huffington Post in 2015. Potential voters \"have to demonstrate proof of age, the vast majority of time people are showing a birth certificate or a passport, which also reflects citizenship. That\u2019s arguably more secure than someone checking a box under penalty of perjury.\"\n\n"}

Rick Perry suggested the Democratic state senator who stood for more than a dozen hours toward defeating proposed abortion restrictions could draw a lesson from her own life.\n\nPerry edged toward talking about Wendy Davis, whom he did not name, by asking who \"are we to say that children born into the worst of circumstances can\u2019t grow to live successful lives?\"\n\n\"In fact, even the woman who filibustered the Senate other day was born into difficult circumstances,\" Perry continued. \"She was the daughter of a single mother. She was a teenaged mother herself. She eventually graduated from Harvard Law School and served in the Texas Senate. It\u2019s just unfortunate that she hasn\u2019t learned from her own example that every life must be given a chance to recognize its full potential and that every life matters.\"\n\nA reader questioned whether the circumstances into which Davis was \"born\" included having a single mother. We also looked at if she was a teenage mother herself.\n\nDavis, who represents a Fort Worth district, has previously referred to her teenage motherhood and to her mother being single, according to web posts and news articles in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.\n\nHer Senate website says Davis \"began working after school at 14 to help support her single mother and three siblings. By 19, Wendy was a single mother herself, working two jobs to make ends meet in hopes of creating a better life for her young daughter.\" The biographical entry on her campaign website has the same sentences.\n\nResponding to our inquiry, Perry spokesman Josh Havens noted the campaign-site reference. \"What the governor said is consistent with what the senator has written in her bio,\" Havens said by email.\n\nDavis\u2019 Senate spokesman, Rick Svatora, said by telephone that the senator, whose June 25, 2013, filibuster drew national and international attention, was \"booked up\" and unavailable to immediately discuss this claim.\n\nBut in 2012, Davis gave sworn testimony about her life in a lawsuit brought before a panel of federal judges in Washington, D.C. \"When I was only 18 I got married,\" Davis said, according to a transcript of her Jan. 20, 2012, testimony. \"I had a baby, I got divorced by the time I was 19 years old. And I had started working, I actually started working when I was 14. I was raised by a single mother. My mother only had a 6th grade education. My parents divorced when I was 11 years old.\"\n\nDavis also testified that she was born in West Warwick, R.I., before moving to Tarrant County. She testified, too, that she graduated from Texas Christian University and then Harvard Law School, with honors.\n\nJerry Russell, Davis\u2019 father and the founder of a Fort Worth theater, returned our telephone call about Perry\u2019s claim and challenged the reference to Davis being \"born into difficult circumstances.\"\n\nRussell said it was \"totally incorrect\" to conclude that Davis was born to a single mother. Rather, he said, he and Davis\u2019 mother were wedded in Rhode Island in 1958, some five years before Davis, the third of their four children, was born there, he said.\n\nRussell initially told us the couple moved to Fort Worth in 1973 and separated in 1976, around when the future senator was 13. He shortly called back and said the separation probably occurred \"closer to\" a couple years earlier, as Davis testified.\n\n\"From that point on,\" Russell said, \"I wasn\u2019t present in the\" family \"home, but I was present in Wendy\u2019s life.\"\n\nRussell said that his ex-wife remarried two or three years after their split and then another time later. He declined to elaborate. According to online Tarrant County records, Davis\u2019 mother, Virginia, whom we failed to reach, married Ira Cornstubble in May 1994.\n\nOur ruling\n\nPerry said Davis, \"born into difficult circumstances,\" was the daughter of a single mother and a teenage mother herself.\n\nHis statement, offered in the cause of a law to curb abortions, could leave the incorrect impression that Davis was born to a struggling single mother, which is not so, best we can tell. Still, the senator\u2019s parents divorced midway through her childhood and Davis spent at least part of her adolescence in a one-parent home. Also, Perry is correct that Davis was a teenage mother herself.\n\nThis partially accurate claim distorts important details"}

Would a Democratic victory for governor next year bring about a graduated-rate income tax for Illinois? And would that be tantamount to a \"massive income tax hike?\"\nLong road ahead\nRauner\u2019s statement implies a Democratic governor could muscle through a change that would replace Illinois\u2019 current flat-rate income tax system with a multi-rate system. That overlooks the fact that the single-rate income tax is enshrined in the Illinois Constitution of 1970, establishing a high hurdle for enacting any change.\n\"A tax on or measured by income shall be at a non-graduated rate,\" begins Article IX, Section 3 of the constitution.\nTo impose a progressive tax system lawmakers would have to amend the constitution. That requires approval of three-fifths majorities in both the Illinois House and Senate to put the issue on a general election ballot. Then voters must approve the amendment by \"either three-fifths of those voting on the question or a majority of those voting in\nthe election,\" according to Article XIV, Section 2 of the constitution.\nFrom 2013 to 2017, Democrats held three-fifths majorities in both the House and Senate yet still could not muster votes to back ballot referendums on a limited graduated income tax plan to impose higher rates on the very rich.\nSince then, Democrats have lost their three-fifths margin in the House, though they control the chamber. In theory that could change in the next election, but to push through a tax referendum in the House before then would require a handful of Republican votes. And that\u2019s not likely to happen.\nThe governor, incidentally, is irrelevant in this process. There is no veto power over constitutional amendments. If approved by voters, they become law.\nUnder the constitution, the only path to get a tax referendum before voters is through the Legislature. Citizen-led petition drives for such a purpose are not allowed.\nBracketology\nRauner also equates a graduated tax system to a \"massive tax increase\" on the middle class.\n\n"}

This implies an increase of 5.5 annual deaths for the county.\" On the other hand, the study\u2019s small sample size make \"any inferential claims\" tentative, the authors wrote.\nWe emailed and telephoned each professor and didn\u2019t hear back.\nSan Francisco County memo\nHunting perspective, we then ran the authors\u2019 names through the Nexis news database. That query led us to a March 2013 story posted by Texas-based D Magazine stating a San Francisco health officer had spelled out flaws in the professors\u2019 paper.\nThat story included a web link to a Feb. 8, 2013, memo from a San Francisco County health officer, Tom\u00e1s Aragon, to Eileen Shields, a county public health information officer. The memo said the county Department of Public Health had reviewed the professors\u2019 paper which, the officer noted, \"has not been submitted for rigorous scientific peer review and publication.\"\nGenerally, the memo states, \"Klick & Wright\u2019s conclusion that San Francisco\u2019s policy of banning of plastic bags has caused a significant increase in gastrointestinal bacterial infections and a \u201846 percent increase in the deaths from foodborne illnesses\u2019 is not warranted.\"\nOne weakness, the memo says, was that the professors presumed a link between reusable bags and a seeming spike in gastrointestinal bacterial infections--yet they failed to establish the link. \"Drawing causal conclusions from this type of study is called an \u2018ecological fallacy,\u2019\" the memo states. \"The basic study flaw is that persons that use reusable bags frequently may not be the same persons that were diagnosed with gastrointestinal bacterial infections in their study. This is the reason epidemiologists will not use ecological studies to test causal hypotheses. At best, ecologic studies raise epidemiologic causal hypotheses but cannot test them.\"\n\n"}

Thom Tillis is putting immigration at the forefront of his campaign.\nAnd to contrast himself with his Democratic opponents, he\u2019s pointing to state-level policies.\nIn a Jan. 10 email newsletter, the Tillis campaign said Democrats Cal Cunningham and NC Sen. Erica Smith support \"sanctuary policies.\"\nThe headline says: \"Sanctuary policies result in gruesome violence, do Cunningham and Smith still support them?\"\nThe email goes on to talk about an \"illegal immigrant\" who was released from jail in Mecklenburg County \"despite the objections\" of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (also known as ICE).\nIs it true that Cunningham and Smith support sanctuary policies?\nNot quite. Cunningham and Smith opposed a bill that would require North Carolina sheriffs to detain people on behalf of ICE. But neither has flat-out endorsed sanctuary policies. Each Democrat has said they believe local governments should have the flexibility to comply or not.\u00a0\nAbout HB 370\nThere\u2019s no single definition of what constitutes a \"sanctuary city.\" The term is loosely applied to cities or states that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.\u00a0\nIn some states, a city can ban its law enforcement from cooperating with ICE (thus earning the term \"sanctuary city.\") But in North Carolina, sanctuary cities are banned. Former Gov. Pat McCrory signed a law prohibiting municipalities from blocking ICE cooperation.\nHowever, sheriffs still had (and still have) some wiggle room. Sheriffs can decide independently whether they want to comply with ICE.\nAs PolitiFact NC has reported, ICE detainers aren\u2019t valid warrants. So a handful of Democratic sheriffs declined to honor detainers. They said they didn\u2019t want to use local resources for federal business, and they feared that cooperating with ICE would harm relationships with their Hispanic constituents.\nThat brings us to the Tillis campaign\u2019s argument.\u00a0\nNorth Carolina lawmakers last year considered a bill that would\u2019ve required sheriffs to comply with ICE. More specifically, the bill -- labeled House Bill 370 --\u00a0 would\u2019ve required North Carolina sheriffs to hold inmates for up to 48 hours beyond the terms of their jail sentence if requested to do so by ICE.\u00a0\u00a0\nContacted by PolitiFact, Tillis spokesman Andrew Romero said the campaign\u2019s claim is based on Cunningham and Smith opposing House Bill 370"}

We decided to take a closer look.\nDoes Amazon \u2018record every conversation\u2019?\nAmazon\u2019s voice-controlled Alexa products are considered \"always-on\" devices \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean they record customers\u2019 conversations.\nThe devices constantly listen for a user to say a \"wake word,\" which triggers Alexa to begin recording voice data and respond to commands. Wake words include \"Alexa,\" \"O.K. Google,\" and \"Hey Siri.\"\nThe Amazon Echo \u2014 one of the online retail giant\u2019s smart speaker product lines \u2014 uses seven microphones to listen for its wake word.

(Khanna said his claim was based on Fowler's piece.)\nAt least, that\u2019s how it works in theory. In practice, the wake word triggering mechanism has a track record that is far from perfect.\nIn one highly publicized incident, a Portland family\u2019s Alexa captured a private conversation after the voice-controlled device misheard what it thought was the wake word. It later sent the audio recording to someone in Seattle whose number was stored in the family\u2019s contact list. (Khanna\u2019s tweet referenced this story.)\nAmazon described the chain of events as \"an extremely rare occurrence,\" and issued the following statement:\n\"Echo woke up due to a word in background conversation sounding like 'Alexa.' Then, the subsequent conversation was heard as a \u2018send message\u2019 request. At which point, Alexa said out loud 'To whom?' At which point, the background conversation was interpreted as a name in the customer\u2019s contact list. Alexa then asked out loud, '[contact name], right?' Alexa then interpreted background conversation as 'right.' As unlikely as this string of events is, we are evaluating options to make this case even less likely.\"\n\n"}

American Crossroads is a conservative, Republican-backed political advocacy group that's launched ads against Democrats around the country. Some are calling the group a \"SuperPAC\" (PAC stands for political action committee) because of its fund-raising prowess and national reach.\n\nThe ad against Hodes features a hot dog cart and carnival music. Here's what the ad says:\n\n\"In New Hampshire, Congressman Hodes claims, 'You deserve a senator who's a real fiscal conservative... and who gets rid of the pork.' But Hodes voted for the pork-filled stimulus bill -- $1.9 million to study ants in Africa, $39 million for office upgrades for politicians. Billions wasted and unemployment still higher. No wonder the Union Leader says 'The guy just can't tell the truth.'\"\n\nWe wanted to check whether the stimulus had \"$1.9 million to study ants\" in Africa and \"$39 million for office upgardes for politicians.\" Both projects are on a list of stimulus projects put together by Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., that American Crossroads pointed us to. The list included\u00a0 \"100 stimulus projects that give taxpayers the blues.\"\n\nLet's start with the ants. Several candidates have been facing this line of attack over their votes in favor of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, better known as the economic stimulus. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Oregon looked at the charge made against Sen. Ron Wyden, Oregon's Democratic incumbent.\n\nWe checked Hodes' voting record and found that he did indeed vote for the stimulus bill.\n\nBut the stimulus didn't release money for ant research directly, and you won't find a \"study of ants\" in the bill's text.\n\nInstead, the federal stimulus gave $3 billion to the National Science Foundation, which otherwise had a budget of about $6.5 billion in 2009. The foundation is an independent federal agency devoted to the progress of science. It distributed the stimulus money using the same peer-review process that it normally uses to decide which scientific research deserves funding.\n\nHere, it's best to quote from PolitiFact Oregon's report:\n\n\"As it turns out, one scientist's study on ants of the Southwest Indian Ocean and East Africa made the cut. PolitiFact Oregon caught up with Brian Fisher, the project's leader and curator of entomology at the California Academy of Sciences, to pick his brain about the recent political celebrity of ants. He was, maybe surprisingly, pretty unfazed.\n\n\"'I think it's legitimate,' he said. 'There's no reason why people shouldn't challenge this and question what we're doing.'\n\n\"What exactly are they doing? Well, over the course of the next five years, Fisher and his team will be studying arthropods -- a category that includes ants -- in a part of the world he describes as immensely diverse, biologically speaking. While ant research might not seem like an obvious target for government funds, Fisher provides a logical defense.\n\n\"Ants, Fisher says, offer insight into climate change, the spread of disease and natural disasters. 'You can't monitor every single living thing, (but) there are key groups that can serve as indicators for other taxa, ants being one of them,' he said. 'Without them, we wouldn't have a functioning ecosystem.' (Taxa are groups of organisms.)\n\n\"It's also worth noting that the project has so far helped employ 16 people, at Fisher's last count.\"\n\nNow, what about the other claim, that the stimulus spent \"$39 million for office upgrades for politicians\"?\n\nThe basis for this claim is a project in to renovate the Kansas State Capitol, a historic structure that dates to the late 1800s. A major renovation has been going on since 2000 to improve the building's wiring, plumbing, heating and air conditioning. And yes, the legislators also wanted more office space and upgraded meeting rooms, according to a 2009 Associated Press report. Hence \"office upgrades for politicians.\" The overall project is expected to cost upwards of $285 million.\n\nThe $39 million from the stimulus bill is not direct funding. Instead, it comes from a special bond program, Build America Bonds, created by the stimulus to help local governments save money on building projects.\n\n\"As a result of this federal subsidy payment, state and local governments will have lower net borrowing costs and be able to reach more sources of borrowing than with more traditional tax-exempt or tax credit bonds,\" said a statement on the U.S. Treasury Department website.\n\nLast summer, state officials decided to use the program to pay for the project, and $39 million is the amount that the federal bond program subsidizes. A Kansas official said that it would save the state about $500,000 in debt service costs.\n\n\"There's not stimulus money that's directly going to the renovation,\" said Amy Jordan Wooden, press secretary for Kansas Gov. Mark Parkinson. \"It gives us a lower interest rate than we could get on the market.\"\n\nFinally, a small bonus fact-check: We were curious about the ad's statement that \"the Union Leader says 'The guy just can't tell the truth.'\" The newspaper's conservative editorial page did indeed say that about an attack ad Hodes launched against his opponent, former attorney general Kelly Ayotte. Our friends at Factcheck.org debunked Hodes' attack on Ayotte, finding he was inaccurate when he suggested she had hidden e-mails that were relevant to a state investigation of an alleged Ponzi scheme. In July, the Union Leader lashed him for \"blatantly false attacks against his leading rival.\"\n\nFor our ruling, we're looking at the ad's statement that \" Hodes voted for the pork-filled stimulus bill -- $1.9 million to study ants in Africa, $39 million for office upgrades for politicians.\" It's true that Hodes voted for the bill, but at the time he had no way of knowing that those particular projects would be funded. It is a stretch to say that he voted for \"$1.9 million to study ants in Africa,\" because he voted to add $3 billion in funding for the National Science Foundation. Its explanation of \"$39 million for office upgrades for politicians\" also leaves out significant details. It's a bond program, not a direct subsidy, and the money supports a large historical renovation, not simply \"office upgrades for politicians"}

Trump accused Clinton -- who started her career at the Children\u2019s Defense Fund and who\u2019s considered child care a signature issue of her political career -- of not having any proposals for parents worried about their child care challenges.\n\"While critical, meaningful policy work has been done in this area, my opponent has no child care plan,\" Trump said. \"She never will. They'll never evolve into a plan. They'll never get done anyway.\"\nTrump wasn\u2019t the only member of his campaign to make this point. His daughter Ivanka -- who became the first person involved in the campaign to publicly focus on child care policy when she gave an address at the Republican National Convention -- echoed that point in an interview with Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly.\n\"There\u2019s no policy on Hillary Clinton\u2019s website pertaining to any of these issues -- child care, elder care, or maternity leave or paternity leave, for that matter,\" Ivanka Trump said.\nIvanka Trump was incorrect about elder care policy not being on Clinton\u2019s website (it\u2019s here) and also wrong about parental leave being absent (it\u2019s here). But since the candidate himself specifically mentioned \"child care,\" we\u2019ll focus on that in this fact-check.\nFairly quickly, we found two headings on the issues page of Clinton\u2019s website that seemed to address the question -- one labeled paid family and medical leave and the other titled early childhood education.\nWhen we asked the Trump campaign to reconcile these headings with his comment, they responded that those two topics are separate and distinct from \"child care.\" The campaign argued that \"child care\" refers to ages 0 to 4 -- before \"early childhood education\" begins at age 4 with preschool. The campaign also said that paid maternity leave is a policy area that\u2019s separate from child care policy.\nAlan Viard, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who was cited favorably in Trump\u2019s policy proposal, said he has \"never before heard of \u2018child care\u2019 being defined as limited to ages 0 to 4.\" He added that the Trump campaign\u2019s decision to include children up to age 13 suggests that \"the campaign does not itself define child care in that odd manner.\"\n\n"}

His team was active on social media, and they constantly uploaded new content and tools to the White House website.\nBut after President Donald Trump was sworn in on Jan. 20, 2017, some critics of the new administration noticed that pages about issues of importance to Obama are no longer accessible on whitehouse.gov.\n\"The White House removed its climate change web page. And the health care, civil rights and LGBT sections,\" tweeted George Takei, the former Star Trek actor who now has a large online fanbase.\nTakei is correct that as of Jan. 23, whitehouse.gov doesn\u2019t have any specific information about climate change, health care, civil rights or LGBT issues. But these changes are routine and reflect the differences between Obama\u2019s and Trump\u2019s priorities.\nBack in October, the Obama administration laid out how it would manage the digital transition. The National Archives and Records Administration would preserve every piece of content the Obama administration published online \u2014 everything from blog posts and Tweets to transcripts and Snapchat stories.\nThe National Archives would also freeze and archive any content posted to whitehouse.gov, then the Obama administration would hand over the domain to the Trump administration. The archived content is now accessible at ObamaWhiteHouse.archives.gov, including pages about climate change, health care, civil rights and LGBT issues. \u00a0\u00a0\nSo if we\u2019re going to be nit-picky, it was the Obama administration that removed whitehouse.gov\u2019s pages about these issues, along with every other piece of content their team ever published.\nThe Trump administration started off with a blank slate. When populating the website with their own content, they did not create pages about the four issues Takei mentioned. They did, however, create six pages about issues that defined the Trump campaign: energy, foreign policy, jobs and economic growth, military, law enforcement, and trade.\nThe Obama team handled the whitehouse.gov transition in the same manner as the George W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations. (Their websites are archived at georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov and clinton4.nara.gov, respectively.)\nThe National Archives treats whitehouse.gov as a presidential record and follows the relevant regulations to preserve the content for posterity, while \"the new administration is free to shape a \u2018new\u2019 White House website going forward,\" said Douglas Cox, a law professor and expert in information policy at the City University of New York.\nCox added as an aside that while whitehouse.gov is well-preserved from administration to administration, the websites for federal agencies may not be. So there is a bigger concern that federal records produced by the agencies in prior administrations may get lost.\n\n"}
{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "John Kasich \"One-third of our college grads leave Ohio within three years.\"", "evidence": "Ohio Gov. John Kasich has been giving a lot of speeches lately to a variety of groups but the message is typically the same: that, in his opinion, the state was on life-support when he took office in January and is slowly recovering thanks to his initiatives.\n\nTo drive his point that Ohioans have become increasingly disenchanted with the Buckeye state, the Republican leader suggests that many college graduates are giving up hope of ever making a career here and instead are choosing to leave to pursue life elsewhere.\n\n\"One-third of our college grads leave Ohio within three years,\" Kasich said at a highway engineers conference in Columbus on Oct. 25. \"We lose our best and brightest.\"\n\nLosing 1 in every 3 Ohio college graduates would be a classic example of what academia has come to refer as the \"brain drain.\" PolitiFact Ohio wanted to know whether the governor accurately captured the girth of the problem.\n\nTo start, the statement seems to overlook the fact that not all college graduates are Ohioans to begin with.\n\nThe Ohio State University, for example, is one of the largest universities in the country with more than 56,000 undergraduate and graduate students on its main campus. About 22 percent of them are not Ohio natives. It stands to reason that some would return to their home state or be recruited for work outside of Ohio.\n\nThat point aside, we decided to look at Kasich\u2019s point of reference.\n\nHis information comes from the Ohio Board of Regents, which in 2008, under a previous administration, said that just 66 percent of Ohio public college grads were still in the state three years after graduation. Then-Chancellor Eric Fingerhut \u00a0aimed to raise that figure to 70 percent by 2017.\n\nThe Regents said that figure still holds today. Regents spokeswoman Kim Norris said 66 percent of Ohio\u2019s Spring 2008 public college graduates were employed in Ohio during the fourth quarter of 2010.\n\nTo put it in numerical terms, Ohio had 39,736 graduates \u2014 associate, Bachelor\u2019s, graduate and professional degrees and certificates combined \u2014 in Spring 2008 and 26,082 of them were working in Ohio late last year.\n\nNorris said the Regents came up with the figure by cross-matching college graduates with employment data from the Ohio Department of Job & Family Services.\n\nBut there is a catch.\n\nThe Regents figures only count people who are employed. It assumes the other 33-percent left the state. That would support the governor\u2019s statement, but isn\u2019t it possible that many of those 14,000 people earning degrees in 2008 are still in Ohio and unemployed?\n\nNorris conceded that also could be the case.\n\nOhio\u2019s unemployment rate in September was 9.1 percent, matching the national rate. There were more than 530,000 Ohioans out of work and actively looking for a job, according to data from the Ohio Department of Job & Family Services.\n\nThe Board of Regents did not have a figure of 2008 college grads who were still in Ohio three years later that includes those that might be unemployed. PolitiFact Ohio thinks it is safe to say that there are not just two options at play here for those college graduates: that either they found a job here or that they left Ohio. Unfortunately, given the state and nation\u2019s economy, some are likely unemployed and looking to put their college degrees to work.\n\nIf the 9.1 percent unemployment rate is applied to the 14,000 people who earned degrees but are not employed in Ohio, it accounts for 1,274 people. That would amount to slightly more than 3 percent of the people who got degrees in 2008.\n\nThe governor is making a salient point, that as the economy limps along, bright, young minds might be encouraged to look for their opportunities elsewhere and that should worry anyone concerned for Ohio\u2019s future.\n\nThe Board of Regents figure does not account for the possibility some of those grads didn\u2019t leave, but are unemployed. That\u2019s information that provides clarification.\n\nAnd even if the unemployment rate is taken into consideration, the figure the governor used is still in the ballpark.\n\nAnd the message behind his statement, that Ohio is losing some of its youngest talent, is a accurate"}

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Barack Obama \"Oil companies showered regulators (at the Minerals Management Service) with gifts and favors, and were essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections and write their own regulations.\"", "evidence": "In his June 15, 2010, Oval Office address responding to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, President Barack Obama touched on the dysfunctional record of the Minerals Management Service, the Interior Department office responsible for both collecting revenues from resource extraction on federal property and regulating drilling companies on those lands.\"One place we\u2019ve already begun to take action is at the agency in charge of regulating drilling and issuing permits, known as the Minerals Management Service,\" Obama said. \"Over the last decade, this agency has become emblematic of a failed philosophy that views all regulation with hostility -- a philosophy that says corporations should be allowed to play by their own rules and police themselves. At this agency, industry insiders were put in charge of industry oversight. Oil companies showered regulators with gifts and favors, and were essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections and write their own regulations.\"We decided to focus on Obama's claim that \"oil companies showered regulators with gifts and favors, and were essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections and write their own regulations.\"To analyze this statement, we decided to break it down into three parts.\u2022 Did oil companies offer \"gifts and favors\" to regulators? There's ample evidence that they did, at least in one Gulf coast office that was investigated. The most recent report of the Interior Department's Inspector General, released on May 25, 2010, found that employees of oil companies regulated by MMS footed the bill for a wide range of perks for employees of MMS' Lake Charles, La., district office. These included hunting and fishing trips; football games; and lunches. In a number of cases, the IG report named specific employees who acknowledged receiving gifts.\nThis year's report followed a series of other IG reports that found a pattern of ethical violations -- including MMS employees' acceptance of free travel, sports tickets and ski outings -- in the agency's royalty-in-kind office. That office oversaw the collection of royalties from oil companies but did not do the kind of industry safety and environmental regulation that Obama was referring to in his Oval Office speech.Either way, this claim by the president seems to be based on solid evidence.\u2022 Were oil companies \"essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections\"? There's also evidence that this happened, from testimony before a joint hearing conducted by the U.S. Coast Guard and the MMS after the spill began.In an account of the hearings, the Washington Post reported that the Deepwater Horizon oil rig that caught fire and sunk \"was registered in the Marshall Islands, a Pacific archipelago that like many jurisdictions, authorizes private organizations such as ... Det Norske Veritas to inspect vessels that operate under its flag. The owners of the oil rigs decide which of those organizations to hire, and they pay for the services.\"The Post reported that when Thomas F. Heinan, deputy commissioner of maritime affairs for the Marshall Islands, was asked whether that arrangement presented a conflict of interest, he answered, \"In some persons' minds it might, but it's been a long-standing facility that's been in place for years.\"The Post also reported that Coast Guard Capt. Verne B. Gifford testified that while the U.S. Coast Guard inspects oil rigs, \"it relies on the private inspectors to do the bulk of the work\" when those rigs are foreign-flagged. For those platforms, Gifford testified, the Coast Guard \"goes onboard the vessel just to verify,\" a process that \"usually takes maybe four to eight hours,\" the Post reported.This addresses inspections overseen by the Coast Guard, but there's also evidence -- somewhat less solid -- that something similar may have been happening with MMS, which was the main target of the president's comments.The IG report on MMS' Lake Charles, La., district office said that a confidential source \"told investigators that some MMS inspectors had allowed oil and gas production company personnel located on the platform to fill out inspection forms. The forms would then be completed or signed by the inspector and turned in for review. According to the source, operating company personnel completed the inspection forms using pencils, and MMS inspectors would write on top of the pencil in ink and turn in the completed form.\"But while the confidential source's allegation was credible enough to include in the report, the IG's office stopped short of confirming the allegation, saying that their investigation of the original forms failed to assure them that the over-writing they found stemmed from fraudulent actions.\u2022 Were oil companies allowed to write their own regulations? This one is the murkiest of the three.In a May 10, 2010, article for McClatchy Newspapers, reporters Les Blumenthal and Erika Bolstad wrote that nearly 100 standards put together by the American Petroleum Institute -- the oil industry's trade group -- have made their way into federal offshore operating regulations. When we asked Blumenthal and Bolstad for their original source, they pointed us to a Jan 11, 2010, issue of the Federal Register.The Register -- the official daily listing of notices from federal agencies -- reported that the MMS \"is incorporating by reference the Eleventh Edition of the American Petroleum Institute's Specification for Subsurface Safety Valve Equipment (API Spec 14A) into its regulations.\" It went on to explain that \"we currently incorporate by reference 97 private sector consensus standards into the offshore operating regulations.\"We asked experts in federal regulation whether this sort of industry-agency collaboration was unusual, and whether it supported the president's assertion that the petroleum industry was writing its own regulations.James Gattuso, a senior research fellow in regulatory policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that this sort of technical standards-writing \"happens all the time.\" \"It is quite common for regulatory agencies to adopt standards drafted, or already in use, in the private sector,\" he said. \"It is especially common in very technical areas where specific expertise in the technologies involved is needed. Agencies, of course, should be wary of self-serving or anti-competitive provisions in such standards, and should use their own judgment in adopting them. But that doesn\u2019t make the use of such standards generally inappropriate.\"Cynthia R. Farina, a Cornell University law professor and the principal investigator for the Cornell eRulemaking Initiative, agreed, saying, \"It's not unheard of for agencies to adopt voluntary consensus standards for the content of federal regulation.\"It's also worth noting that the API's standards weren't slipped into federal rules at midnight in some smoke-filled room. The proposed rule was published on June 12, 2008, and for the next two months, the public had an opportunity to comment. Farina added that the regulation in question was put into place using a process that requires the Interior Department to consult with a variety of other government entities.As it turns out, only two entities did offer comments on this rule -- Baker Oil Tools and the Offshore Operators Committee. Farina calls this \"a huge problem with rulemaking in general. Certainly the absence of comments from environmentalists and neutral researchers in the area would exacerbate concerns about industry 'writing its own regulations.'\"Still, MMS can't be blamed for poor response to its call for comments. That's why we think that while Obama was on solid ground with his accusations that MMS regulators were \"showered ... with gifts and favors\" and that oil companies \"were essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections,\" the notion that industry wrote its own regulations is not a slam-dunk.\n\n"}

A second claim, on building traffic lights in China, we rated Mostly\u00a0False. \u00a0In this fact-check, we\u2019re examining if those tax credits included \"half a billion to an electric car company that created hundreds of jobs in Finland.\"\n\n(We've also checked many other exaggerations about the stimulus.)\n\nThe ad said its source for the Finland claim was an ABC News article, \"Car Company Gets U.S. Loan, Builds Cars In Finland.\"\n\nA loan for U.S. work\n\nThe first clue something\u2019s wrong is in that ABC News headline. A car company got a \"U.S. loan.\" That\u2019s not the same thing as a tax credit. Taxpayers expect to get loan money back, with interest. (Though, they don\u2019t always. See: Solyndra.)\n\nThings get even more wrong from there.\n\nThat U.S. loan program? It's the\u00a0Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program through the Energy Department. And it's not funded by Obama\u2019s stimulus bill \u2014 otherwise known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. It is, in fact, a program signed into existence by President George W. Bush in 2007 and first funded by legislation Bush signed in 2008.\n\n\nThe program was designed to support development of advanced technology vehicles.\n\nThe Bush administration was in charge when the automaker filed its application. The Obama administration was in charge when the company\u2019s loan was approved. The stimulus bill had nothing to do with it.\n\nNow, the ad could have raised relevant criticism of the Energy Department\u2019s loan programs. Watchdogs inside and outside government have argued since the Bush administration that the programs haven\u2019t included safeguards sufficient to protect taxpayers. Instead, the ad says stimulus tax credits funded overseas jobs. That\u2019s the claim we\u2019re weighing here. And that\u2019s just not the case.\n\nFisker Automotive, a U.S. automaker with global headquarters in Anaheim, Calif., got its $529 million federal loan to develop and produce two lines of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles \u2014 the Karma and the Nina.\n\nThe project was expected to create about 2,000 \u00a0jobs in Wilmington, Del., where the Nina would be manufactured, according to the Energy Department.\n\nPart of the loan \u2014 $169 million \u2014 paid for design, engineering and other work in the United States on the Fisker Karma. A larger part \u2014 $359 million \u2014 was slated to help buy and reconfigure a shuttered General Motors plant in Delaware to build the Nina.\n\nHere\u2019s where Finland enters the story: Before its Energy Department loans were approved, Fisker had decided it would manufacture the Karma at a plant in Finland. The company argued there simply wasn\u2019t a U.S. plant available for the type of car they were building. But 65 percent of the parts for the Karma, based on cost, would come from U.S. suppliers.\n\n\"There was no contract manufacturer in the U.S. that could actually produce our vehicle,\" Henrik Fisker, the company's founder, told ABC News. \"They don't exist here.\"\n\nThe loan for the design of the car \"was only used for the U.S. operations\" and could not be spent overseas, according to \u00a0Fisker and the Energy Department.\n\nMeanwhile, most of the loan has yet to be disbursed.

{"label": "pants-fire", "claim": "National Republican Congressional Committee Says \"Kurt Schrader supports Obama\u2019s sequester \u2026 but won\u2019t cut $1.6 million to fund new video games.\"", "evidence": "Since just before the sequester set in March 1, the National Republican Congressional Committee has been filling email in-boxes in Oregon with allegations that U.S. Rep. Kurt Schrader has shirked his fiscal duties by siding with fellow Democrat, President Barack Obama.\n\nAn email from an NRCC spokeswoman had this subject line: \"Kurt Schrader\u2019s priorities: A robotic squirrel.\" That was followed by a press release sarcastically thanking Schrader for standing by while the government wastes money \"on frivolous programs like the production of a musical about climate change and a menu of foods people could eat on Mars \u2013 yes, the planet Mars.\"\n\nThose were followed by a limited-distribution online banner ad that reads: \"What?! Kurt Schrader supports Obama\u2019s sequester \u2026 but won\u2019t cut $1.6 million to fund new video games.\"\n\nBy this point, PolitiFact Oregon can\u2019t stop giggling. A musical about climate change? A robo-squirrel to pick up robo-nuts? A new menu of what we might eat on Mars, maybe while playing new video games? We were intrigued to find out more, even though we know that campaign blasts from the major parties tend to be over the top.\n\nFor those of you not keeping up with sequester news: A long, long time ago, Obama and Congress agreed to across-the-board federal cuts if they couldn\u2019t agree on a more measured way to reduce spending and balance the budget. Well, guess what? They couldn\u2019t agree -- Obama and Democrats want new revenue; Republicans do not -- so the country is in sequestration mode, with $85 billion in automatic cuts between now and Sept. 30, 2013.\n\nRepublicans are using the impasse to drum up public support for their cause and against Democrats. The National Republican Congressional Committee -- which is chaired by Oregon\u2019s very own Rep. Greg Walden -- wants to take out Schrader in 2014. Other Democrats, including Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore, are being similarly targeted nationally.\n\nNow that we have the background, let\u2019s try to unwind the statement. Is it true that Schrader supports Obama\u2019s sequester, but refuses to cut $1.6 million for video games?\n\nAccording to an NRCC statement, Schrader voted for the sequestration bill, and voted against legislation that would have replaced it. That\u2019s accurate-ish. Schrader joined his party in voting against two GOP-backed bills last year that would have replaced the across-the-board cuts with deep cuts to entitlements and social programs. \u00a0\n\nBut let\u2019s not forget this: The 2011 bill creating the sequester law was backed by 174 Republicans, including Walden, Majority Leader Eric Cantor and House Speaker John Boehner. To single out Schrader -- and other potentially vulnerable Democrats -- as supporting the sequester ignores an awful lot of Republicans who voted for the sequester bill, and blames Democrats for failing to vote for a replacement budget dictated by Republicans.\n\nNow on to the fun stuff.\n\nAll four items highlighted by the NRCC come from the annual \"Wastebook\" put out by Sen. Tom Coburn, R-OK. His office identified about $18 billion worth of wasted -- in his opinion -- tax dollars in 2012. The programs are included regardless of home state or party backing.\n\nFor example, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is spending about $1 million a year -- out of a $17 billion budget -- to develop food items for a 2-1/2-year trip to Mars in the 2030s.\n\nThe robo-squirrel reference comes from a $325,000 National Science Foundation grant to researchers in California who are studying how a robot squirrel might fake out a non-robot rattlesnake. A New York City-based theater also received nearly $700,000 from the NSF to create a musical about climate change and biodiversity.\n\nAnd, finally, NASA is spending $1.6 million to develop video games and other entertainment as a way to get more students interested in science, math and technology.\n\nThe point being made by House Republicans is obvious: The White House need not furlough airport security workers when there are so many other places to cut.\n\nYet $18 billion plucked from a \"waste book\" is not close to $85 billion. And, seriously, Congress doesn\u2019t go back and comb through individual budgets and kill off low-level programs a senator deems frivolous. The broader NSF and NASA budgets were approved by both Republicans and Democrats. There is no either-this-or-that choice to make in the here-and-now, and to suggest that Democrats could cut a Mars-related project for more airport securityis misleading.\n\nCertainly Republicans are making a valid point that the two sides could make targeted, intelligent reductions, but that\u2019s not the hang-up in the standoff. The hang-up is over money. Republicans do not want to raise taxes. \u00a0\n\nIn a response to PolitiFact Oregon, NRCC spokeswoman Alleigh Marr\u00e9 said that Schrader voted twice against sequester replacementbills. Did those bills, we asked, include a line item reduction of $1.6 million for NASA\u2019s video games? The response: No, they did not.\n\nIn case you\u2019re wondering, Schrader\u2019s office declined to comment on how the congressman truly feels about video game development, Mars food items and other spending choices mocked in the Wastebook. His office says he opposes the sequestration as bad policy that doesn\u2019t address long-term cost drivers, like health care.\n\nOf course he does. We can\u2019t think of anyone who thinks across-the-board cuts is a good way to budget. And despite the NRCC\u2019s assertion that this is Obama\u2019s sequester, PolitiFact has ruled that the sequester is the baby of both parties. (And no, Obama can\u2019t blame Congress either.)\n\nThe NRCC\u2019s online ad states: \"Kurt Schrader supports Obama\u2019s sequester \u2026 but won\u2019t cut $1.6 million to fund new video games.\"The statement is inaccurate in many ways. This is not Obama\u2019s sequester, as PolitiFact has ruled. Schrader voted for the 2011 bill authorizing sequestration, along \u00a0with many Republicans. He voted against two sequestration bills pushed by Republicans that would have sheltered defense at the expense of human services and entitlement programs.\n\nNeither of those bills included a line item calling for $1.6 million to be taken out of NASA\u2019s budget for video games. Schrader was not in a position to cut -- or to not cut -- that money with his sequestration-related votes. Clearly the ads are meant to showcase extreme examples of budget fat. But in doing so, the NRCC has jumped into spacey nonsense. We find the claim not only false, but ridiculously so"}

And it took the Legislature to pass it,\" Weinberg said in a Feb. 7 appearance on NJToday.\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey found Weinberg is right. In 1915, the men of New Jersey decided a woman\u2019s place was not in the voting booth. Five years later, the state Legislature ratified the 19th amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which confirmed a woman\u2019s right to vote.\n\nHere\u2019s the history:\n\nUnder New Jersey\u2019s 1776 state Constitution, women were not specifically excluded from the right to vote. And some women did vote, according to \"Reclaiming Lost Ground: The Struggle for Woman Suffrage in New Jersey\" by Neale McGoldrick and Margaret Crocco. It is estimated that as many as 10,000 women in New Jersey voted between 1790 and 1807, the year the state Legislature restricted voting rights to men.\n\nSuffragists waged state and national campaigns. Though some states succeeded in granting women the right to vote before the federal amendment was ratified in 1920, states on the East Coast struggled, \"challenged by political bosses, liquor interests, and others who feared that woman suffrage would result in prohibition,\" McGoldrick and Crocco wrote.\n\nBy 1915, suffragists in New Jersey -- as well as in New York, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania -- managed to put a woman\u2019s right to vote on the ballot. All four measures failed.\n\nIn New Jersey, more than 184,000 residents voted against the referendum, compared with more than 133,000 who voted for it. Majorities in every county voted the ballot question down, except for Ocean County where it passed by less than 160 votes, according to a breakdown of the vote from the New Jersey Historical Society.\n\n\"New Jersey law did not permit the amendment to be reintroduced into the Legislature for five years. Since the amendment had to be submitted to two successive Legislatures for approval, this meant that a New Jersey amendment was at least seven years off,\" according to McGoldrick and Crocco.\n\nBut women in New Jersey didn\u2019t have to wait seven years.

Rodney Frelinghuysen, the United States is increasing its debt twice as fast as its economy is expanding.\n\nA May 25 e-mail newsletter from the Morris County Republican cited growth in debt compared with the increase in the gross domestic product, or GDP -- a measure of the nation\u2019s economy -- in the first quarter of 2012 and said, \"the U.S. is borrowing approximately $2.52 for every $1 of economic growth so far in 2012.\"\n\nReally? PolitiFact New Jersey checked the congressman\u2019s numbers and found he\u2019s right -- down to the penny.\n\nLet\u2019s first discuss the different types of federal debt.\n\nGross federal debt includes two components: debt held by the public, which is money the government owes outside entities, and intragovernmental holdings, which is essentially money the government owes itself.\n\nAs we -- and our PolitiFact colleagues -- have noted previously, some economists prefer to focus on debt held by the public since it is money borrowed from private groups rather than gross debt.\n\nIn the time frame the congressman specified, the debt held by the public actually increased more than the gross debt. Here, we\u2019ll note the changes in both measures of debt and compare each with the growth in the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nIn the first three months of 2012, the gross debt grew by more than $359.1 billion to reach more than $15.58 trillion. Over the same time frame, the debt held by the public grew by $399.1 billion, totaling nearly $10.85 trillion.\n\nAccording to preliminary estimates from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis -- the most recent data available at the time Frelinghuysen\u2019s e-mail newsletter was sent -- the GDP grew by $142.4 billion to reach roughly $15.46 trillion in the first quarter of 2012. Those figures are in current dollars and not adjusted for inflation.\n\nSo how does the national economy\u2019s expansion compare to growth in federal debt?\n\nGross debt grew by more than $359.1 billion in the first three months of 2012, while the GDP increased by $142.4 billion. That\u2019s $2.52 added to the debt for each $1 added to the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nOr for debt held by the public, it\u2019s $2.80 in borrowing for each $1 in GDP growth.\n\nWe should note that the Bureau of Economic Analysis released updated figures on Thursday that showed slower growth in GDP. According to that data, the GDP grew by $134.6 billion in the first quarter of 2012.\n\nUsing that figure, the nation added $1 to the economy for every $2.66 it added to the gross debt.\n\nJason Peuquet, the research director for the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said Frelinghuysen\u2019s statistic is not very surprising given the impact of the economic downturn on the federal budget. Lower revenues driven in part by high unemployment and stagnating wages, as well as increased spending on programs such as unemployment insurance and food stamps have all added \"even more to deficits and debt in the near term,\" Peuquet said.\n\nBut, Peuquet said, \"the most important fact isn\u2019t that this is going on because this is what everyone would have predicted.\" More importantly, he said, \"we are not on a path to have the budget recover completely once the economy does\" because structural deficits will \"keep piling on more and more.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nFrelinghuysen said: \"the U.S. is borrowing approximately $2.52 for every $1 of economic growth so far in 2012.\"\n\nThe gross debt grew by more than $359.1 billion in the first three months of 2012.

They note that district leaders had projected before he took over that CPS was on track to run a deficit of more than $1 billion by 1999.\nUnder Vallas, that huge deficit never materialized, and district financial records he pointed to show that by his last year at the helm in 2001 CPS claimed a positive balance of nearly $1 billion in all of its financial accounts.\nBut can Vallas credit his policy decisions entirely for that transformation? Not exactly.\nIn 1995, lawmakers in Springfield turned over control of the district, which was facing one of many financial crises, to Mayor Richard M. Daley. He named Vallas, who had been serving as his budget director, chief executive officer. Daley also appointed Gery Chico, now a mayoral opponent of Vallas\u2019, as school board president.\nBut the new guard at CPS also got to play by a different set of financial rules. Instead of receiving state aid earmarked for specific purposes, for example, the district started getting a significant amount of funding in the form of a block grant. Another big change that helped un-tie its fiscal hands: Lawmakers allowed property tax dollars, which had previously flowed directly into the pension fund for teachers, to go to CPS instead. And in 1997, legislators permitted the district to forego payments into the pension fund provided it hit benchmarks signifying sound fiscal health.\n\"He was not operating under the same conditions as the CEO that existed prior to 1995,\" said Amanda Kass, associate director of the Government Finance Research Center at the University of Illinois-Chicago.\nDuring Vallas\u2019 six years with the district, and for several years following his tenure, CPS paid next to nothing toward teacher pension costs. The Vallas era at CPS coincided with the dot.com bubble that sent markets soaring, helping the pension fund stay healthy even without the annual injections of cash it began missing out on.\nHad Springfield not changed the law, the CPS teacher pension fund would have been paid $90 million in 1995 to cover the employer share of pension costs that year. Instead, it got $10 million. Over the next decade, the fund was out $2 billion.\nWe asked Vallas in a phone interview why he opted to stop pension payments. \"The system was earning such strong returns, it didn\u2019t require that we make contributions during those few years,\" he explained.\n\n"}

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "JB Pritzker Says a study projected that a pension buyout program he expanded would save \"billions and billions, potentially $25 billion.\"", "evidence": "During a recent sit-down interview at a local business forum, Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker dismissed the possibility of changing the Illinois constitution to make it possible to reduce public retiree benefits.\nEchoing growing calls from certain groups to ask voters next year to eliminate the clause that protects those benefits, the moderator at the event hosted by the Economic Club of Chicago asked Pritzker why he won\u2019t promote such a plan as part of his broader push to shore up the state\u2019s finances.\nIn response, he argued there are other ways to help fill the state\u2019s massive pension hole. One of his examples caught our attention:\n\"In the spring, we expanded a program to buy out \u2014 a voluntary program \u2014 to buy out retirees when they\u2019re retiring at 60% of what their pensions would be,\" Pritzker said. \"People are choosing to take the money up front. It\u2019s saving the state money. In fact, a study was done of what the savings would be and it\u2019s billions and billions, potentially $25 billion of savings. And by the way, people are choosing it \u2014 almost 20% of people who are retiring are choosing that buyout.\"\nIllinois\u2019 unfunded liability \u2014 the gap between its pension assets and the benefits it has committed to pay future retirees \u2014 is nearly $137 billion, largely due to decades of underfunding by public officials. And $25 billion sounds like it could go a long way toward addressing that shortfall.\nBut Pritzker left a lot of questions unanswered. He didn\u2019t provide a timeframe for those savings, nor was it clear from his remarks which program he was describing or what study determined it could save the state billions. So we decided to find out.\nUnpacking Pritzker\u2019s claim\nIn response to our inquiry, Pritzker spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh said the governor was referencing two programs that allow some participants in the state\u2019s three largest retirement systems to forego certain benefits in exchange for an upfront payment.\nBoth buyout programs were created as part of the 2018 state budget and were extended in the budget Pritzker signed this year to June 30, 2024 from their original sunset date in mid-2021. But each program is more limited than what the governor described.\nOne program allows people who formerly worked for the state \u2014 including its public schools and universities \u2014 long enough to qualify for a state pension and who have not yet begun to draw from it to trade all rights to a future retirement benefit in exchange for a lump sum equal to 60% of the total lifetime pension they would have received. Despite being a total buyout worth the same percentage Pritzker referenced, this program applies to a much smaller subset of state retirement system members than his comment suggests.\nThe other program permits retiring members who were hired before 2011 to trade the 3% compounded automatic annual increase to which they are entitled under the state\u2019s two-tiered pension structure for an annual increase of 1.5% on the original value of their pension, which would not be compounded. In exchange, they receive a lump sum equal to 70% of the difference between the value of the higher and lower annual increases. In short, it is not a total pension buyout.\nSo far, participation and cost savings associated with both programs has been limited. Out of 3,600 qualified inactive members of the State Employees\u2019 Retirement System (SERS), which covers state employees who do not work in public education or for the judicial and legislative branches, 22 have elected to take a total buyout since it became an option for those members in 2018, according to a spokesman. At the Teachers Retirement System of Illinois (TRS), 297 out of 14,598 eligible members have decided to participate, a spokesman for that system told us.\nThe participation rate was higher for the accelerated annual increase program. Since last December, 719 out of 2,889 retiring Tier 1 SERS members have elected to take it, for a participation rate of nearly 25%, according to SERS. At TRS, which covers employees at public schools outside Chicago, 596 \u2014 or 16% \u2014 of the system\u2019s 3,715 eligible retiring members opted for it this year.\nFor context, however, there are roughly 61,000 retired SERS members and 64,000 current employees. TRS, the state\u2019s largest system, has about 112,000 retirees currently drawing benefits and 163,000 current employees.\n\"The statement makes it sound like a large portion of people are taking these options and it\u2019s important to realize that it\u2019s a limited pool who\u2019s even eligible for these buyout programs,\" said Amanda Kass, associate director of the Government Finance Research Center at the University of Illinois-Chicago and an expert on state and local pensions.\n\n"}

Mark Pocan, a Madison-area Democrat, announced his proposal to eliminate the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). That was five days after President Donald Trump signed an executive order ending the separation of families who were trying to enter the United States illegally at the Mexican border.\nTo be clear, ICE was not involved in those border actions, which resulted in the separation of more than 2,300 children and their parents.\nPocan instead alluded to ICE actions taken inside the United States, accusing a unit of the agency of \"hunting down and tearing apart families\" at churches and schools, and raiding places such as garden centers and meatpacking plants.\nHis proposal drew the wrath of Vukmir, who faces Kevin Nicholson in the Aug. 14, 2018, Republican primary for the Senate. The winner will take on Baldwin on Nov. 6, 2018.\nIn a news release on July 5, 2018, Vukmir raised the prospect of open borders, saying Pocan\u2019s proposal would be \"effectively eliminating our border\" She added: \"Sen. Baldwin, where do you stand? Do you believe we should eliminate border enforcement? Americans deserve to know.\"\n(Baldwin doesn\u2019t support Pocan\u2019s proposal, which was introduced as legislation on July 12, 2018. In an odd twist, Pocan and other Democrats who introduced the measure said the same day that if GOP leadership follows through with their vow to\u00a0bring it to the House floor, they would vote against it.\u00a0\"We know\" Speaker Paul Ryan \"is not serious about passing our\" bill, the Democrats declared\u00a0in a statement, saying they \"will not engage in this political stunt.\"\nSo, Vukmir is claiming that Pocan\u2019s proposal to eliminate ICE would \"eliminate border enforcement\" \u00a0\u2014 a broad statement essentially echoed later by her campaign spokeswoman.\nBut Pocan isn\u2019t proposing to get rid of border enforcement \u00a0\u2014 and ICE isn\u2019t the agency that patrols the borders, anyway.\nWhat is ICE?\nMany Americans might associate ICE with border enforcement. But as University of Texas professor and immigration expert Ruth Ellen Wasem put it, \"most do not know that ICE\u2019s role in immigration enforcement is not at the border.\"\nBorder security is actually the responsibility of another federal agency \u00a0\u2014 Customs and Border Protection. CBP is the parent agency for the Border Patrol, which patrols the U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada. It is the Border Patrol that did the recent separation of parents from children at the Mexican border.\n\n"}

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "David Cicilline \"When I took office in 2003, we had very little reserves.\"", "evidence": "On March 3, Providence\u2019s new mayor, Angel Taveras, released \"staggering\" figures showing that the city has a $180-million structural deficit for this fiscal year and next and has nearly depleted its reserve or \"rainy day\" funds. \"I thought we had a Category 3 hurricane,\" Taveras said. \"This is a Category 5.\"\n\nIn the wake of that announcement, Taveras\u2019 predecessor, U.S. Rep. David N. Cicilline, was criticized for leaving the city in poor financial shape and draining reserve funds to balance his last city budget.\n\nCicilline denied that he had masked an emerging financial crisis in Providence and he defended his accomplishments during his eight years as mayor, saying that, \"When I took office in 2003, we had very little reserves, and we worked very hard to build up our reserves.\"\n\nWe decided to take a look. We began by asking Cicilline\u2019s communications director, Jessica Kershaw, to provide the basis for the former mayor\u2019s statement.\n\nIn reply, Cicilline\u2019s congressional office issued a statement saying: \"When referring to the unreserved fund balance, or rainy day fund, as the attached Comprehensive Annual Financial Report shows, in 2003, when Cicilline took office as mayor, there was $10 million, and the Cicilline administration more than doubled that by building it up to $22 million by 2008.\"\n\nAttached to the statement was a page from the city\u2019s audited financial statement for the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2010. That page shows Providence had an \"unreserved\" general fund balance of $10.2 million at the end of fiscal year 2003. That total rose to a high of $22.36 million at the end of fiscal year 2008, but it plunged to $2.08 million at the end of fiscal year 2010.\n\nSo does $10.2 million represent \"very little reserves\"? Well, at that time $10.2 million was just under 3 percent of the city\u2019s $345 million in actual general operating spending for 2003.\n\nCertainly, that\u2019s not nearly as much as the $22.36 million in unreserved fund balance that the Cicilline administration had accumulated by fiscal year 2008 -- about 5 percent of the city\u2019s actual spending that year.\n\nBut it\u2019s a whole lot more than the $2.08 million that the Cicilline administration had left by the end of fiscal year 2010 -- about 0.5 percent of the actual spending.\n\nAnd it looks really good in comparison with the $220,814 that remained in those reserves as of March 11.\n\nBut what is the standard for determining whether a city\u2019s rainy day fund is sufficient? Public finance literature often focuses on a 5 percent standard. And this year, the Government Finance Officers Association executive board is recommending revised \"best practices\" that call for the equivalent of two months -- or 16.6 percent -- of annual spending.\n\nWith that in mind, did Cicilline have \"very little reserves\" when he had $10.2 million, or about 3 percent?\n\nGary S. Sasse, the former Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council director and state revenue director who is now financial adviser to the Providence City Council, said, \"I would say 3 percent is marginal reserves. It doesn\u2019t meet the requirement of 5 percent. But it\u2019s better than nothing. It\u2019s better than we have right now.\"\n\nCity Treasurer James J. Lombardi III, a critic of Cicilline\u2019s financial practices, said that while the 2003 unreserved fund balance fell below \u00a0the 5 percent threshold, that doesn\u2019t mean Providence had \"very little\" reserves at the time. \"Clearly, it was a lot more than we have today,\" he said.\n\nPlus, the Cicilline administration had other restricted contingency accounts as a cushion, Lombardi said. And in 2003, the city\u2019s assets included the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts Center, which it later sold. Now, the city has slashed its unreserved general fund balance, depleted restricted contingency accounts and borrowed at least $60 million to balance the budget, he said.\n\nCicilline has defended his decision to use reserve funds and to borrow money to balance budgets, saying those actions were better than cutting city services and significantly raising taxes. \"It was a judgment that I made that that was the best way to navigate through the worst economy since the Great Depression,\" he said.\n\nSo where does that leave us?\n\nCertainly, it\u2019s true that when Cicilline took office, the unreserved fund balance did not meet the often-cited 5 percent threshold and it fell well short of the 16.6-percent goal that a professional group now recommends.\n\nBut it\u2019s a stretch for the former mayor to characterize the $10.2 million he had in 2003 \u00a0as \"very little.\" After all, that\u2019s almost five times what was in the reserve fund in his last year in office.\n\nGiven municipal finance standards, there is an element of truth in Cicilline\u2019s claim, but his statement ignores critical facts that would give a much different impression"}

Meanwhile, an opponent, U.S. Rep. John Carter, R-Round Rock, says it will slap higher taxes on families with children who have special needs.\n\n\"$13 billion tax increase on families with special needs thanks to Obamacare,\" Carter said in an April 12 Twitter message that links to the House Republican Conference blog, where a series of \"ObamaCare Flatlines\" posts started appearing shortly after President Barack Obama signed the health care legislation in March. Carter is the secretary of the conference, which consists of every Republican House member. U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam, from Illinois, also sent his Twitter followers the tax blast.\n\n\"An estimated 30 million families use pre-tax dollars in flexible spending accounts (FSA) to pay for routine medical care and other vital child care services,\" the conference's April 9 post states, going on to note that those families include parents with special needs children who use their pre-tax FSA dollars to pay fees related to their child's education.\n\n\"ObamaCare burdens these families with a huge tax increase,\" the post continues, because the law caps the money a person can put in their flexible spending account at $2,500 per year.\n\nA $13 billion tax increase on families with special-needs children?\n\nCreighton Welch, Carter's press secretary, pointed us to a March 20 report by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) that estimates the flexible spending cap will generate $13 billion in revenue by 2019. The committee advises Congress on tax policy.\n\nWelch said the reference to \"30 million families\" using flexible spending accounts comes from the right-leaning Americans for Tax Reform, whose tax policy director, Ryan Ellis, told us the statistic came from the Employee Benefits Research Institute, a nonpartisan research center that collects and analyzes data on employee benefit plans. Yet the institute, which doesn't take positions on policy issues, told us it couldn't vouch for the number. An industry estimate from the companies that administer the programs for employers is about 30 million, according to a June article by Kaiser Health News, part of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which analyzes health policy.\n\nSome employers offer their employees the choice of signing up for flexible spending accounts. Those employees send a portion of their pay to an account that can be tapped for certain medical expenses. Employees bank the dollars tax-free, thus reducing their taxable income. The GOP conference cites several examples of medical expenses parents with a special child could pay for with their flexible spending account, including Braille books.\n\nSome other existing restrictions on the savings accounts: In most cases, employees have to save all medical receipts and submit them to an administrator. And they must spend the entire balance; if there's money left in the account at the end of a year, their employer keeps it.\n\nFor that reason, beneficiaries tend to use the accounts for routine health expenses they know will come due, not emergencies. They're a reliable way to fund co-pays, dental care and special procedures that can be scheduled to match an account holder's accumulated contributions. People with more serious illnesses who have predictable costs also can benefit significantly.\n\nThe new health care law includes a provision that will cap flexible spending accounts at $2,500 per year, starting in 2013. There currently isn't a federal cap, though the institute says some employers limit how much their employees can put in their accounts. Typical limits range from $2,000 to $5,000.\n\nThe $13 billion reflects the additional income tax revenue the government expects to reap during the seven years from 2013 through 2019 due to some employees with flexible spending accounts incurring more taxable income.\n\n"}

{"label": "false", "claim": "Sheldon Whitehouse \"When George Bush took office, President Clinton, a Democrat, and the Democratic Congress at the time had left an annual budget that was in surplus.\"", "evidence": "With polls showing Americans becoming increasingly concerned about the debt, Democrats have been trying to blame President George W. Bush and Republicans for fiscal decisions of the past decade. But in some cases, the Democrats have gotten their facts wrong. In a speech on the Senate floor on June 24, 2010, Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island criticized the Bush Administration for squandering a federal surplus.\"When George Bush took office, President Clinton, a Democrat, and the Democratic Congress at the time had left an annual budget that was in surplus,\" Whitehouse said. \"It was returning more money to the federal government than we were spending. It was an annual budget in surplus. We had a national debt at the time, but with the annual budget in surplus, our Congressional Budget Office \u2014 the nonpartisan, not Republican, not Democratic, professional Congressional Budget Office \u2014 had estimated that, when George Bush took office, we would be a debt-free nation by 2009. We would be a debt-free nation by 2009. That was the trajectory that Democratic President Bill Clinton and the Democratic Congress left, along with those annual budget surpluses, when George Bush and the Republicans took office.\"We won't delve into the varying degrees of blame that Clinton and Bush deserve for the current deficit and debt in this item. But when Whitehouse says that \"Clinton, a Democrat, and the Democratic Congress at the time had left an annual budget that was in surplus,\" he's wrong.When Clinton handed over the reins to Bush, there was a Republican Congress, not a Democratic one. In fact, it wasn't even a close call: For the last six years of Clinton's term, the GOP had been in control of both the House and the Senate.We'll note that on the numbers, rather than the party labels, Whitehouse is correct. In 2000, Clinton's final year in office, the federal government ran a surplus of $236 billion. The following year, Bush's first as president, the surplus was $128 billion. That was the last time the government ran a surplus, at least as of now. In early 2001, the CBO did indeed predict surpluses as far as the eye could see -- enough to eliminate the debt by 2009, as Whitehouse said.When we contacted Whitehouse's office, a spokesman acknowledged that the statement could have been articulated more clearly, but added that the senator was referring to the 1993 Clinton budget, which was passed narrowly by a Democratic House and Senate with widespread Republican opposition. Many economists argue that this blueprint set the table for the budget surpluses of the 1990s.So we see where Whitehouse, who got elected to the Senate in 2006,\u00a0 is coming from with this explanation. But when we looked at the words he spoke on the Senate floor, we decided that they did not indicate he was referring to the 1993 budget. In cases where we think someone simply misspoke inadvertently, we give them leeway. And we'll credit Whitehouse for repeating the numbers accurately. But in this case, Whitehouse said the same mistake twice -- and it was crucial to the point he was making on assigning partisan blame.

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Dwight Jones Says under his utility rate plan, \"An estimated 50 percent of our residential households will see a decrease in their water and wastewater bills.\"", "evidence": "Richmond Mayor Dwight Jones sees his plan to overhaul the city\u2019s water and wastewater rates as a glass half full.\n\nHis plan cuts in half the base rates that all customers pay simply to have access to the city\u2019s water system. It also more than doubles a second charge to customers based on the amount of water they use and flush into the sewer system.\n\n\"Through this rate structure change, an estimated 50 percent of our residential households will see a decrease in their water and wastewater bills,\" Jones said in a March 12 news release announcing the plan.\n\nWe wondered if the mayor was correct.\n\nUnder his plan, the monthly base rate charged to all customers for water and wastewater service would drop from $49.40 to $26.11. Meanwhile, the second monthly payment based on the volume of water used would rise from $4.22 to $9.03 for every 100 cubic feet that comes into their taps or leaves their home as wastewater. That 100 cubic feet, listed as a \"ccf\" on a resident\u2019s water bill, amounts to about 750 gallons -- roughly 15 bathtubs full.\n\nThe new rates are part of Jones\u2019 proposal for a Richmond budget that is scheduled for a City Council vote May 13. Jones said his rates are not aimed at generating more revenues but were designed to shift more of the burden of supporting the utility to the residents who use the most water.\n\nTammy Hawley, a spokeswoman for the mayor, sent us a Department of Public Utilities chart breaking down the number of residential customers by their water use. The chart showed that 25,904 customers were billed for using 400 cubic feet or less each month in the 2012 fiscal year, the most recently completed budget cycle.\n\nThat comes to about half of the city\u2019s 51,832 residential customers.\n\nAnother chart Hawley sent shows that anyone charged for using 400 cubic feet or less would see lower bills. That\u2019s because the increase in their volume fee would be less than the savings they would get from the halving of the base rate.\n\nPeople right at that 400 cubic foot threshold now pay $66.28 a month. The new rates would drop their monthly bills to $62.23 -- a savings of $4.05. The less water they use, the greater their savings.\n\n"}

We paid for it.\"", "evidence": "The National Republican Senatorial Committee recently aired an ad in the hotly contested Iowa Senate race between Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley and Republican state Sen. Joni Ernst. It features a woman named Darlene Blake of Des Moines, Iowa, talking about the importance of Medicare.\n\"Bruce Braley voted to cut $700 billion from Medicare to support Obamacare,\" Blake says. \"That\u2019s just not fair. We paid in. We paid for it. That should be there for us.\"\nIn a separate fact-check, we looked at the claim that Braley \"voted to cut $700 billion from Medicare to support Obamacare.\" Here, we\u2019ll look at the claim that cuts to Medicare affect people who have already \"paid in. We paid for it.\"\nThe ad has a point that Americans 65 and over have \"paid in\" to Medicare through the payroll taxes they\u2019ve paid throughout their working lives. Currently, workers pay a 1.45 percent payroll tax for Medicare, while employers kick in an additional 1.45 percent. Self-employed people pay both parts of the tax. Meanwhile, starting in 2013, households earning $125,000 (or $200,000 or $250,000, depending on the number of people in the household and their tax-filing status) pay an additional 0.9 percent Medicare tax.\nHowever, it\u2019s not as if those payroll taxes are placed in an account for that beneficiary\u2019s future use alone. Instead, the proceeds of payroll taxes paid by workers of all ages (combined with the proceeds of current beneficiaries\u2019 Medicare premiums) foot the bill for the Medicare costs of today\u2019s beneficiaries.\nAnd the way the math has worked out over the years, today\u2019s beneficiaries have gotten far more back in Medicare spending than they put into the system through their tax payments. We discussed this topic in 2013, using statistics from the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research institute in Washington. We\u2019ll recap their findings here, updated with the most recent data.\nInstitute researchers figured out what people turning 65 in various years have already \"paid in\" to the system and what they can expect to \"take out\" after they reach age 65. Because marital status and family income can significantly affect both the amount paid in and the amount paid out, the institute offers calculations for various types of family units.\nTo make the final amounts comparable to what might have been done with the tax money had it been invested privately, the institute adjusted all dollar figures at 2 percentage points above the rate of inflation. (The authors note that different assumptions for long-term returns on investment would change the results.)\nWe looked at the statistics for three \"cohorts\" of seniors -- those who turned 65 in 2000, 2005 and 2010. That means they\u2019re 79, 74 and 69 years old today.\nWe found that, for Medicare recipients, the \"worst\" deal for any of these demographic groups is still quite generous. A two-earner couple, with one high earner and one average earner, who both turned 65 in 2010 would have paid $158,000 in Medicare taxes over their lifetimes, but can be expected to be the recipient of $385,000 in Medicare spending. That\u2019s a ratio of $2.40 in benefits for every dollar paid in taxes -- and that\u2019s the least generous ratio we found.\n\n"}

Of that population, officials counted 5,568 living in emergency shelters while 403 were found living on the street. Overall, the homeless count was down 12 percent from 2013, officials said.\nWe looked at Pence\u2019s most recent budget and found no money for emergency shelters. Under the line item for homelessness prevention, Pence requested zero dollars in both years of the biennial budget. There is $1.17 million in homeless assistance grants, but those are federal dollars. They come from the McKinney-Vento program administered through the Housing and Urban Development Department. There is also $1 million in mental health services for the homeless, but those too come from Washington.\n\"There has never been state funding directly for homeless shelters or programs,\" said Brad Meadows, communications director for the Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority.\nMeadows added that towns and cities have the option to spend local money to care for the homeless.

{"label": "false", "claim": "Mitt Romney President Obama\u2019s lawsuit claims it is unconstitutional for Ohio to allow servicemen and women extended early voting privileges during the state\u2019s early voting period.", "evidence": "After some Ohio voters faced hours-long lines at polling places during the 2004 presidential election, the state adopted reforms designed to prevent similar problems in the future. Those reforms included allowing voters to cast ballots at county boards of elections for an extended period before elections. In 2008, Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaign used those new laws to its advantage. The campaign made particular use of voting the Sunday before elections in Ohio and other states as African-American churches organized \"Souls to the Polls\" events that took congregants to vote after religious services.\n\nRepublicans who control Ohio\u2019s state government passed a law last year that would have reduced the time frame for early voting from five weeks to three, eliminated most weekend voting hours and dropped a requirement that poll workers redirect voters to the correct precinct if they show up at the wrong one in a location that hosts multiple precincts. Ohio legislators repealed that law when it became clear it would face a referendum this year, though its ban on early voting on the weekend before elections remained in place because it was part of a separate law. \u00a0Democrats including U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown say Republicans wanted to eliminate that weekend\u2019s early voting to cut turnout among African-Americans who vote after church, a demographic likely to vote for Obama. Brown said that in 2008, up to 19 percent of Ohio voters cast their ballots during the weekend before the election.\n\nLast month, President Obama\u2019s re-election campaign filed a lawsuit against Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted \u00a0to demand that in-person voting be allowed during the three-day weekend before elections. It noted that approximately 93,000 Ohioans voted in the three days before the 2008 presidential election. The lawsuit argues that all Ohio voters should be permitted to cast ballots that weekend, as members of the U.S. military are permitted to do. The complaint alleged that Ohio\u2019s legislature failed to justify the disparate treatment between military and nonmilitary voters, and contended the \"unequal burden on the fundamental right to vote violates the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.\"\n\nThat assertion by the Obama campaign riled more than a dozen military groups - including AmVets and the Military Officers Association of America. On Aug. 1, they filed a motion to intervene in the Obama campaign\u2019s lawsuit. It said they want to \"defend the fundamental constitutional right to vote of members of the U.S. Armed Forces, which includes the right to receive special accommodations, flexibility and extra time to facilitate their voting, whether absentee or in-person.\" \u00a0Their legal filing said the means the Obama campaign was using to request an overall extension of Ohio\u2019s early voting period - \"a ruling that it is arbitrary and unconstitutional to grant extra time for early voting solely to military voters and overseas citizens - is both legally inappropriate and squarely contrary to the legal interests and constitutional rights\" of members of the U.S. Armed Forces.\n\nOn the same day as the military groups filed their briefs, attorneys for the state of Ohio filed their own response to the Obama campaign\u2019s complaint. It said that special laws were enacted to help uniformed and overseas citizens cast absentee ballots because they are often not present in the areas where they vote, and that the state of Ohio doesn\u2019t have to treat other voters the way it treats those uniformed and overseas citizens.\n\n\"From the beginning of our Republic, military voters have had special problems in obtaining ballots and casting them,\" the state of Ohio\u2019s legal filing says. \"Ohio\u2019s laws, allowing UOCAVA (Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voter Act) voters the ability to cast an absentee ballot after the time during which non-military and domestic voters may do so has closed, rationally recognizes the unique circumstances that military voters may face.\"\n\nThe state of Ohio filed a brief that backed intervention by the military groups. So did the Obama campaign.\n\n\"Plaintiffs seek to restore for all voters access to early voting through the Monday before Election Day,\" the Obama campaign\u2019s brief said. \"Neither the substance of its Equal Protection claim, nor the relief requested, challenges the legislature\u2019s authority to make appropriate accommodation, including early voting during the period in question, for military voters, their spouses or dependents. The question before the Court is whether, in the circumstances of this case, the State of Ohio may arbitrarily and without justification withdraw from all other Ohio eligible voters the same right they previously had to vote the weekend and Monday before election day.\"\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for these dry legal exchanges to erupt into a political bonfire. Toward the end of last week, websites began to make the misleading claim that the Obama campaign was suing the state of Ohio to restrict military voting, when the lawsuit actually sought to permit all Ohio voters to vote the weekend before elections, as military voters can do. On Saturday, GOP Presidential candidate Mitt Romney issued a statement that accused Obama of trying to undermine the rights of military voters.\n\n\"President Obama\u2019s lawsuit claiming it is unconstitutional for Ohio to allow servicemen and women extended early voting privileges during the state\u2019s early voting period is an outrage,\" Romney\u2019s statement said.\n\nIn an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Obama campaign advisor David Axelrod disputed the way that Romney and others were characterizing the lawsuit.\n\n\"What that lawsuit calls for is not to deprive the military of the right to vote on the final weekend ,\" Axelrod told host Chris Wallace. \"Of course, they should have that right. That suit is about whether the rest of Ohio should have the same right. And I think it\u2019s shameful that Governor Romney would hide behind our servicemen and women to try and win a lawsuit to deprive other Ohioans. . . of the right to vote.\"\n\nDemocrats lined up their own military members to protest how some were describing the lawsuit.\n\nFormer Democratic congressman John Boccieri of Alliance, \u00a0a Lt.

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Barack Obama The Republican budget plan \"says that 10 years from now, if you\u2019re a 65-year-old who\u2019s eligible for Medicare, you should have to pay nearly $6,400 more than you would today.\"", "evidence": "In his April 13, 2011, speech on his vision for America\u2019s fiscal future, President Barack Obama quickly went on the offensive against the Republican deficit-cutting budget proposal championed by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., a plan that passed the House in a partisan vote two days later.\n\nObama was particularly critical of Ryan's controversial proposal to dramatically overhaul Medicare. While Medicare benefits would remain as they are now for people 55 and older, when those younger than 55 reach retirement, the traditional Medicare system would be replaced with \"premium support\" payments that would subsidize the purchase of private insurance plans.\n\n\"It\u2019s a vision that says America can\u2019t afford to keep the promise we\u2019ve made to care for our seniors,\" Obama said. \"It says that 10 years from now, if you\u2019re a 65-year-old who\u2019s eligible for Medicare, you should have to pay nearly $6,400 more than you would today.\u00a0 It says instead of guaranteed health care, you will get a voucher. And if that voucher isn\u2019t worth enough to buy insurance, tough luck \u2013 you\u2019re on your own. Put simply, it ends Medicare as we know it.\"\n\nThis $6,400 figure has become a White House talking point and is sure to be repeated often as the 2012 campaign heats up, so we thought we'd better take a look.\n\nWe'll begin by explaining how Obama arrived at the number. It's based on an analysis of the Ryan plan by the government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which concluded that those who get premium support payments in 10 years will end up paying substantially more for their health care than if Medicare is left as is.\n\nAccording to the CBO analysis (see page 20 -25), under the Ryan plan, the $8,000 premium support voucher in 2022 would cover 39 percent of the cost of the average private plan for a 65-year-old. Which means the plan actually costs about $20,500 and that beneficiaries would be on the hook for about $12,500 of the cost.\n\nThe CBO also presented estimates for an \"alternative fiscal scenario\" \u2013- which incorporates \"several changes to then-current law that were widely expected to occur or that would modify some provisions of law that might be difficult to sustain for a long period.\" Under this scenario, the typical beneficiary who enrolled in traditional Medicare would pay about 30 percent of the cost of the average private plan in 2022, or about $6,150. In other words, the increased amount the 65-year-old would have to pay would be about $6,400.\n\nThe nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which did an analysis of the CBO data, came up with the same numbers as Obama. So did the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nRepublicans don't contest that's what the CBO numbers are.\n\nBut Obama left out an important fact, said Stephen Spruiell, a spokesman for the Republicans on the Committee on the Budget: \"Elsewhere in the letter, CBO makes clear that the comparison is making unrealistic assumptions in order to construct a future for Medicare under the status quo \u2013- a future in which Medicare goes bankrupt, seniors suffer from reduced access to care, and the nation enters a debt crisis.\"\n\nIndeed, the CBO clearly states that both of its scenarios, by keeping benefits largely as they are, would create \"pressures over the long term that would make them difficult to sustain.\" Without Medicare reform, the CBO warned \"the government\u2019s debt would skyrocket to levels unprecedented in the United States.\" That would result in either rising tax rates or \"surging federal debt.\" And that, in turn, might lead lawmakers to reduce Medicare benefits.\n\nSaid Spruiell: \"Comparing our plan to save Medicare to an unsustainable status quo means comparing a real plan to a false reality. The president\u2019s comparison is not valid, because he ripped the CBO number out of context and omitted the director\u2019s clear warnings about the unsustainability of the status quo.\"\n\nGail Wilensky, who ran the Medicare program under President George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s, said the CBO also does not take into account the behavioral changes that Ryan's plan would likely encourage.\n\nRight now, she said, all the pressure is on the providers. But under the Ryan plan, more of the burden shifts to the consumers. If it is set up as it is for federal employees, there would be a wide range of plans, at a wide range of costs. And people will be able to shop around and change every year, Wilensky said.\n\n\"This gets people looking and being involved in a way that they haven't been,\" she said.\n\nConsumers will be highly motivated to migrate to cheaper plans, she said, and there will be more competition among providers.\n\nThe CBO often gets it wrong when it comes to predicting behavioral change, Wilensky said. For example, she said, the Medicare part D prescription drug program has proven to cost about 40 percent less than government projections. The CBO did not predict the market competition caused by people using private drug plans, she said.\n\n\"So be cautious of the CBO numbers,\" she warned.\n\nSo where does that leave us with Obama's claim that the Republican plan \"says that 10 years from now, if you\u2019re a 65-year-old who\u2019s eligible for Medicare, you should have to pay nearly $6,400 more than you would today\"?\n\nThat number is based on a CBO analysis of the Republican plan. Republicans rightly point out that the CBO warned that unless major reforms are made to the Medicare program, it could lead to skyrocketing public debt, which might ultimately lead to pressure on legislators to reduce Medicare benefits.\n\nIn his speech, Obama used the lower of two CBO estimates of costs, one based on some anticipated changes in Medicare. And he did not argue for the status quo on Medicare.\n\n\"We will change the way we pay for health care -\u2013 not by the procedure or the number of days spent in a hospital, but with new incentives for doctors and hospitals to prevent injuries and improve results,\" Obama said. \"And we will slow the growth of Medicare costs by strengthening an independent commission of doctors, nurses, medical experts and consumers who will look at all the evidence and recommend the best ways to reduce unnecessary spending while protecting access to the services that seniors need. \u00a0\n\n\"We believe the reforms we\u2019ve proposed to strengthen Medicare and Medicaid will enable us to keep these commitments to our citizens while saving us $500 billion by 2023, and an additional $1 trillion in the decade after that,\" Obama said. \"But if we\u2019re wrong, and Medicare costs rise faster than we expect, then this approach will give the independent commission the authority to make additional savings by further improving Medicare.\"\n\nWhether that approach will succeed is a matter of political debate. Obama has accurately portrayed the consequences of the Republican plan, at least according to the CBO analysis. It's a long-term projection -- which always carries a degree of uncertainty, and some, like Wilensky, argue that the CBO fails to adequately account for the behavioral changes the plan would encourage, which might drive costs substantially lower. (We should note that some Democrats believe the CBO has consistently underestimated health care cost-saving initiatives contained in the controversial health reform law passed last year.)\n\n"}

{"label": "true", "claim": "Rick Scott Says the military accounts for about 10 percent of Florida's economy.", "evidence": "Gov.-elect Rick Scott kicked off a five-day, 10-city tour of the state's major industries on Dec. 6, 2010, by meeting with defense contractors and Florida-based military leaders.\n\nScott started the tour in the Panhandle, meeting with about 20 defense contractors, including Boeing, Lockheed Martin, L-3 Communications and InDyne Corp., at the University of Florida Research and Engineering Education Facility in Shalimar, before meeting with military leaders at Eglin Air Force Base.\n\n\"We want to make sure we're always thought of as a very military-friendly state,\" Scott said to reporters at a brief press conference. \"We're going to focus on what our strengths are. We're clearly a logical place for the military to expand and for the defense industry to expand. We've got a lot of talent in the state, we like the defense industry and the military, so we're going to figure out where we have the most value.\"\n\nScott tried to underscore the importance of the military to Florida by noting that the military accounts for about 10 percent of Florida's economy, according to the St. Petersburg Times.\n\nFlorida is home to 20 major military installations and three unified combatant commands. The Gulf of Mexico is a key training ground for both the Air Force and the Navy, and the state also has two U.S. Coast Guard air stations and another dozen other Coast Guard stations.\n\nBut does all of that translate to a 10 percent share of the state's gross domestic product, which was $737 billion in 2009?\n\nThe answer comes from an arm of Enterprise Florida called the Florida Defense Alliance, a public/private partnership created in 1998 to help position Florida to keep its military infrastructure in place and expand in other areas when opportunities arise. The group commissioned a study in 2008 to examine the economic impact of Florida's stationed military and auxiliary defense industry work.\n\nThe study was conducted by Rick Harper, an economist from the University of West Florida, who has studied the economic impact of the film and entertainment industry in Florida and who represented Northwest Florida on former Gov. Jeb Bush's Council of Economic Advisers from 2001-2006. Using 2005 data, Harper concluded that defense-related spending is responsible for $52 billion, or 7.5 percent, of Florida's gross state product that year.\n\nThe military spent $27 billion across Florida counties in fiscal year 2005, Harper concluded -- $10.4 billion was for goods and services, $12.4 billion for pensions and transfer payments, and $4.3 billion for salaries and wages. The rest of the economic impact is measured in indirect and induced spending, which would include parts of the private defense industry as well as parts of the Florida economy that help service the military, the defense industry and their employees.\n\nHarper said that defense and military spending accounted for 732,300 direct and indirect jobs in the state and generated state and local tax revenues of nearly $1 billion.\n\nCounties with larger installations enjoy larger impacts, Harper found. Military and defense spending in Duval County had a $12.1 billion impact, a $5.3 billion impact in Hillsborough County and a $6.6 billion impact in Okaloosa County. All but six counties have at least $3 million per year in direct defense-related spending.\n\nHarper and Florida Defense Alliance executive director Rocky McPherson noted that the study does not include the economic impact generated by the Florida National Guard or Coast Guard operations. You can see a short synopsis of the study for yourself here. Or if you have a lot of time, here's the three-volume version.\n\nHarper's study relies on five-year-old data, so we wanted to see if there was anything more recent. McPherson said Harper and University of West Florida researchers were updating their study using 2008 data but, he said, that report is not available yet. Harper declined to share the results of the study with PolitiFact Florida, but did talk about the results in general terms.\n\nSince 2005, Department of Defense \"spending has risen substantially, particularly in terms of procurement (i.e., contracting), as well as payments to disabled veterans, although active duty military staffing numbers (number of people) have declined somewhat and payments to retirees are not growing as they did earlier due to attrition of WWII and Korean era veterans,\" Harper wrote. \"The overall growth in military spending (the study to be released uses 2008 federal spending data), combined with weakness in other areas of the Florida economy in the most recent years, means that DoD (Department of Defense) spending will have risen as a share of the total economy.\"\n\nWe searched around for other studies measuring the military's economic impact in Florida, but found none. In examining Harper's study, we found it to be a straightforward, unbiased report. Researchers relied on Department of Defense actual expenditures, precise personnel levels and actual government contracts.\n\nWhere does it leave us? Scott told reporters military spending makes up about 10 percent of the state's economy. In 2005, military spending accounted for 7.5 percent of the state gross domestic product, but that figure did not include the impact of the Florida National Guard or Coast Guard bases. The author of the study, who is now updating his report using 2008 numbers, said that while he cannot release more up-to-date numbers, that the military's position in the economy has risen since 2005. That will make Scott's point nearly right on"}

It has been since 1994 that a Democrat has been elected in Texas.\" The claim was noted for us by University of Texas journalism student Joshua Fechter.\n\nThe last Democrats were elected statewide in 1994. Those victors included Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, Attorney General Dan Morales and State Comptroller John Sharp. In the year's marquee race, Republican George W. Bush denied Gov. Ann Richards a second term.\n\nAnd have Texas Democrats been shut out of statewide office longer than Democrats elsewhere?\n\nWe left Castro a message seeking backup information, then recalled that the Associated Press said in a July 30, 2012, news article: \"Texas Democrats have the longest losing streak in the nation in statewide elections.\" The story suggested the party\u2019s July 31 runoff for its U.S. Senate nomination would indicate if Democrats had hopes of changing that record this year.\n\nTo gauge whether Texas has the nation\u2019s longest current stretch of statewide Democratic also-rans, we looked first at which states have Democratic governors.Twenty states have Democratic governors, according to the National Governors Association, while Rhode Island has an Independent chief executive and the others are led by Republicans.\n\nOf the 28 states outside Texas with Republican governors, 15 have at least one Democratic senator, the Senate roster shows, as does Rhode Island.

Check out this story from FactCheck.org about all of the claims made in the e-mail.\n\nNow, let\u2019s explain how the national debt has increased under Obama.\n\nThere are two commonly cited forms of national debt -- debt held by the public and total debt.\n\nThe debt held by the public refers to money borrowed from investors outside of the federal government. The total debt represents debt held by the public as well as money the federal government owes itself, including for programs such as Social Security and Medicare.\n\nOn Jan. 20, 2009, the date of Obama's inauguration, debt held by the public was about $6.3 trillion and total debt stood at roughly $10.6 trillion, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s \"Debt to the Penny\" calculator.\n\nA year later, debt held by the public was about $7.8 trillion and total debt was about $12.3 trillion. Those figures represent over-the-year increases of about 24 percent and 16 percent in the respective categories.\n\nBoth forms of debt continued to increase in the two subsequent years, but at a declining pace.\n\nBetween Jan. 20, 2010 and Jan. 20, 2011, debt held by the public grew by about 20.5 percent and total debt increased by roughly 14 percent.\n\nFrom Jan. 20, 2011 to Jan. 20, 2012, debt held by the public went up by around 11.3 percent, while total debt increased by about 8.4 percent.\n\nWhen PolitiFact New Jersey received the chain e-mail on July 10, debt held by the public stood at about $11 trillion and total debt was about $15.9 trillion. Compared to Obama\u2019s inauguration, that\u2019s an increase of roughly 75.6 percent and 49.5 percent, respectively.\n\nSo, starting with the inauguration, the largest over-the-year increase in either form of national debt was about 24 percent. Over the course of roughly three and a half years, both forms of debt have risen sharply, but still haven\u2019t doubled.\n\nThe factors behind debt increases over the last decade include legislation approved by Obama, such as the stimulus bill signed in February 2009 and tax cuts enacted in December 2010, according to a study released in April 2011 by the nonpartisan Pew Fiscal Analysis Initiative.\n\nBut other contributing factors were initiated under President George W. Bush, including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the analysis shows. Experts also have told us the weak economy has contributed to the higher debt.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA chain e-mail circulating in New Jersey claims Obama \"doubled the national debt, which had taken more than two centuries to accumulate, in one year.\"\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that the national debt has increased significantly since Obama took office, but it\u2019s outrageous to claim it doubled in one year.\n\nStarting with his inauguration, the largest over-the-year increase in either form of national debt was about 24 percent. Even after roughly three and-a-half years into his presidency, both forms of debt still have not doubled.\n\nWe\u2019re just left with three words to describe this claim: Pants on Fire!\n\n"}

We\u2019ll recap.\n\nThe Salem Harbor Power Station\n\nBack on Feb. 5, 2003, Romney made several statements during a showdown over the future of the controversial, coal-burning Salem Harbor Power Station, in the Boston area.\n\nA couple of years earlier, Massachusetts had passed new rules to reduce power plant emissions of nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and mercury, to be phased in over several years. The mercury standard would not be finalized until 2004. As governor, Romney supported the rules, as he made clear repeatedly.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMassachusetts singled out its most egregious polluters as the \"Filthy Five\" plants, including Salem Harbor. Public health and environmental scientists at Harvard studied the emissions from two of the plants in 2000 and concluded that Salem Harbor was responsible for 53 deaths, 570 emergency room visits, 14,400 asthma attacks and 99,000 incidents of upper respiratory symptoms -- all per year.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nLocal residents and others who wanted to keep the Salem Harbor plant open (for jobs and tax revenues) disputed those figures, saying they resulted from unproven modeling. It turned out that the Harvard scientists had revised their figures in 2002, putting premature deaths from Salem Harbor\u2019s pollution at 30 per year and reducing the number of emergency room visits to 400 and the asthma attacks at 2,000, according to the Boston Globe and the Boston Herald.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBut the scientists stood by the broader conclusion -- that emissions from dirty power plants can be deadly. The Harvard methodology has now been widely replicated and is respected by health scientists, according to several environmental authorities we spoke with. Romney appeared to accept their findings, too.\n\nThe spat with Salem Harbor turned into a testy exchange after Salem Harbor\u2019s then-owner, Pacific Gas and Electric, sought an extension until 2006 to comply with Massachusetts\u2019 emissions rules -- and plant supporters showed up to to demand that the governor back off. Romney was adamant that the company comply by 2004 and appeared at a press conference near the plant to emphasize the point.\n\nHis statements that day show how he felt, and they\u2019re documented in this video: \"I will not create jobs or hold jobs that kill people, and that plant -- that plant kills people.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nObama said Romney has changed his tune about coal, claiming that in Massachusetts he \"stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, \u2018This plant kills.\u2019\"\n\nRomney was the newly elected governor when a showdown erupted over the coal-burning Salem Harbor Power Station.

Sarah Palin's conservative credentials have excited the GOP base, and perhaps in equal fashion have ignited the passions of liberals.\n\nPalin remained Topic A during the Republican National Convention and her resume has been picked over by friends and foes alike. In the foe category would be MoveOn.org, the liberal activist group, which on Sept. 2 sent an e-mail to an estimated 3.2-million supporters, offering their views of Palin's flaws as a public official.\n\n\nOne item caught our attention. The e-mail said Palin, Alaska's governor since 2006, \"supported right-wing extremist Pat Buchanan for president in 2000.\"\n\n\n\"This is information the American people need to see,\" the email said. \"Please take a moment to forward this email to your friends and family.\"\n\n\nIn making its allegation, Move.on picked up on a charge made by others, most notably Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., a longtime Barack Obama supporter. The charge relies on a single Associated Press story from July 1999 about Buchanan's campaign stop in tiny Wasilla, Alaska, where Palin was mayor at the time. The article described Palin as \"among those sporting Buchanan buttons.\"\n\n\nWe won't delve into the question of whether Buchanan really is a \"right-wing extremist.\" Those are the kinds of judgments voters can make for themselves. But the allegation that Palin was a Buchanan supporter might carry some weight, especially among Jewish voters, many of whom consider him to be anti-Israel. Wexler, in his charge, said Buchanan had \"a uniquely atrocious record on Israel,\" and the Anti-Defamation League calls Buchanan a \"racist, anti-Semite.\"\n\n\nSo the question is this: Did Palin support Buchanan in 2000?\n\n\nNo. Shortly after Buchanan's visit to Wasilla, and after the AP story, Palin wrote a letter to her local newspaper making clear that her appearance at the Buchanan event wasn't an endorsement of his candidacy. Published July 26, 1999, the letter said:\n\n\n\"As mayor of Wasilla, I am proud to welcome all presidential candidates to our city. This is true regardless of their party, or the latest odds of their winning. When presidential candidates visit our community, I am always happy to meet them. I'll even put on their button when handed one as a polite gesture of respect.\n\n\n\"Though no reporter interviewed me for the Associated Press article on the recent visit by a presidential candidate (Metro, July 17), the article may have left your readers with the perception that I am endorsing this candidate, as opposed to welcoming his visit to Wasilla. As mayor, I will welcome all the candidates in Wasilla.\"\n\n\n"}
{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Rush Limbaugh The government is \"going to have the right to get into your bank account with the health care bill and make transfers without you knowing it.\"", "evidence": "On his radio program on Aug. 28, Rush Limbaugh continued to hammer the Democrat-backed health care bill, claiming ominously that it would allow government \"the right to get into your bank account...and make transfers without you knowing it.\"\nA similar claim was included in a widely circulated chain e-mail that contains numerous distortions about the health care bill. We examined the claims in depth and reported on many of them  here. \nLimbaugh has raised this issue several times. On Aug. 6, 2009, a caller to his radio program said, \"Listen, of all the scary things in this health care bill, Rush, the scariest thing is this:\u00a0 The government, if this passes, will be able to go into your bank account or anybody's bank account \u2014 I just read this last night \u2014 anybody's bank account, take the money out to fund this monstrosity.\u00a0 Did you know that?\"\u00a0\n\nSaid Limbaugh, \"He's right, folks, he's right.\u00a0 That is in the House bill.\"\nThe provision in question is in Section 163 of the House bill (page 59) , under the heading \"Administrative Simplification.\" It broadly sets out goals for standardizing electronic health records.\nThe legislative summary says the intent in the section is \"to adopt standards for typical transactions\" between insurance companies and health care providers.\nEdwin Park, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the intent is to set standards for electronic communication between health providers and insurance companies and has nothing to do with an individual's bank account. So for example, a doctor would have access to real-time information about a patient's co-pays and whether a particular procedure or medication is covered under their plan, how much is owed, and so on, he said. Much of that already happens today, he said, but it would standardize electronic records so that with out-of-network transactions, everyone is using the same coding and standards.\nPark's interpretation is shared by Health Care for America Now, which is lobbying for health care reform. According to the group's Web site, the provision \"continues the discussion of administrative standards, and authorizes electronic transfers of money within the government. In no way does this provision grant the government access to individual bank accounts.\"\nBut some say the wording of the bill is ambiguous, and does appear to allow for the possibility of addressing electronic health payments from a patient's individual bank account. Robert Book of the Heritage Foundation pointed to a clause in Section 163 that states that it would \"enable electronic funds transfers, in order to allow automated reconciliation with the related health care payment and remittance advice.\"\nSome interpret that as a vehicle to allow people to pay their health bills through automatic deductions from their personal bank accounts.\nAnd in an e-mail sent out by David Axelrod, a senior adviser to President Barack Obama, in which he sought to debunk some of the \"lies and distortions\" that have circulated in e-mails about health care reform, he seems to suggest that's exactly what is being contemplated.\n\"No, government will not do anything with your bank account,\" Axelrod wrote. \"It is an absurd myth that government will be in charge of your bank accounts.\u00a0 Health insurance reform will simplify administration, making it easier and more convenient for you to pay bills in a method that you choose.\u00a0 Just like paying a phone bill or a utility bill, you can pay by traditional check, or by a direct electronic payment. And forms will be standardized so they will be easier to understand. The choice is up to you \u2013 and the same rules of privacy will apply as they do for all other electronic payments that people make.\"\n\n"}
{"label": "false", "claim": "Bill Clegg The U.S. deficit \"increases at $3 million per second.\"", "evidence": "The national debt is just over $13 trillion. That's $13 million million. If you divide the number by the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s world and U.S. population figures, that's nearly $42,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States and almost $1,900 for every human being on the planet. So it's understandable that a lot of candidates would want to talk about it, especially after Congress passed a landmark health-care bill that, critics contend, will add to that deficit.One is Bill Clegg, \u00a0one of four Republicans who have filed to run for Congress against incumbent Democrat Rep. James Langevin in the 2nd District. On the \"Federal Spending\" tab of his \"Issues\" page, Clegg talks about how the cost of government has increased, beginning with a reference to the speaker of the House.(The web posting was written before the health-care bill passed, so the \u201cover $12-trillion\u201d number in the following quote was true at the time.) \"And so Nancy Pelosi announced to the world her sophisticated rationale for a horrible health care bill that our elected officials attempted to ram down our throats. That was the first time when the so-called reform legislation contained such noxious provisions as mandated coverage, free rides for certain officials for their votes (think Nebraska and Senator Ben Nelson), and sleight-of-hand accounting that would add trillions to the deficit -- which is already over $12 trillion and increases at $3 million per second. As I write this, we have yet to see the fate of the latest 'bi-partisan' health legislation but you can bet it won't be cheap.\"What intrigued us was the assertion that the deficit was increasing by $3 million each second.(Actually, Clegg was referring to the national debt.

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Travis Rowley \"The RI Board of Elections has heard official testimony from Providence residents who claim to have witnessed known illegal aliens voting in local elections.\"", "evidence": "Controversy continues to churn over the issue of voter identification one month after the General Assembly passed a voter ID bill. Gov. Lincoln Chafee signed it into law on July 2.\n\nUnder the new law, voters in the 2012 election will be asked to show some form of identification; in 2014, they\u2019ll be asked for an ID with a photo.\n\nOpponents have continued to complain that it's an expensive solution -- cost estimates for providing free IDs vary widely -- for a problem that essentially doesn't exist. They also maintain it will lower turnout of the poor, elderly and minorities.\n\nSupporters say requiring an ID is essential to the integrity of an election.\n\nThe law allows registered voters without an ID to cast a provisional ballot. That ballot will be counted later if the local Board of Canvassers determines that the signature on the ballot application matches the signature on the person's registration.\n\nOn July 19, GoLocalProv published a column by Travis Rowley, pundit, chairman of the Rhode Island Young Republicans, and a supporter of voter ID, arguing that past abuses made the new law necessary. (The column grew out of a challenge he accepted during the July 8 edition of Channel 36's \"A Lively Experiment\" to cite a single conviction for voter fraud in the state.)\n\nIn the column, Rowley talked about cases in East Providence involving people who voted where they had their businesses -- not where they actually lived. He mentioned anecdotes of people supposedly posing as other voters, citing the claim of Rep. Anastasia Williams, a Providence Democrat.\n\nWilliams says that she and her daughter went to their polling place in 2006, only to discover that two other people had used their names. (Rowley reported, incorrectly, that it was last year. Williams never filed a complaint.)\n\nAt the end of his column, Rowley played the illegal immigrant card:\n\n\"The RI Board of Elections has heard official testimony from Providence residents who claim to have witnessed known illegal aliens voting in local elections,\" he said.\n\nWe were intrigued.\n\nSo we called Robert Kando, executive director of the board, to find out about these cases.\n\nKando said that during his six-year tenure with the board, it has heard just one such claim. A check of Journal archives uncovered no cases and former elections board Chairman Roger Begin, who served from 1994 to 2006, said he could not recall any instances.\n\nThe case Kando recalled \"was during one of our recount hearings -- it was not the last election, it was a while ago -- where a losing candidate or the candidate's wife, who was looking for a new election, said, 'We saw people who we know aren't U.S. citizens and we know they voted.' The question then was, 'Who?' They said, 'It's just someone that we knew. But we didn't know their names.' \"\n\nGiven that lack of specifics, Kando told us, \"there was no need to ask any more questions.\" In addition, no complaint was ever filed with the board.\n\nSo we sent messages to Rowley on July 22, via email and his website, to tell him what Kando said and to ask if he had additional information. While we waited for a response -- we have yet to receive one -- we did some further checking.\n\nWith Kando's help, we went back and checked the records, including listening to the tape of the Sept. 20, 2006, meeting that served as the source of Kando's statement. It turned out that his recollection of that meeting five years ago was off a bit.\n\nThe agenda included complaints from two unsuccessful Providence candidates who said they had seen evidence of voter fraud. The board took testimony from both Laura Perez and Eulogio Acevedo, along with hearing from Acevedo's wife, Maryelyn. Contrary to Kando's recollection, the Acevedos made no reference to fraud by illegal immigrants.\n\nBut Perez did. She had lost to Grace Diaz in the District 11 primary and in her complaint letter she said, \"I personally witnessed an individual who voted but is not an American citizen.\" She reaffirmed that statement during the hearing. Her other allegations of irregularities involved five people, but none of those complaints involved citizenship status.\n\nThe board voted to send both complaints to the state police for investigation. Perez told us police never contacted her. Perez's letter gave no names. She told us she knew the identity of the woman -- and that the woman was in the country illegally -- but wasn't going to reveal the name until the state police contacted her.\n\nState police Lt. John Lemont, assistant detective commander, said he recalled the case, one of several that police were probing at the time. But in her letter, \"there wasn't information specific enough to go forward with an investigation. We therefore closed the investigation.\"\n\nAsked if he's heard of other allegations of voter fraud involving illegal immigrants, Lemont said, \"I'm unaware of any other complaint, other than this one person.\" There have been successful prosecutions, but those have been \"based on people voting in the wrong district.\"\n\nThe Sept. 20, 2006, elections board meeting also included a presentation by Terry Gorman, president of the then-fledgling Rhode Islanders for Immigration Law Enforcement. He was seeking support for a voter ID law. Gorman offered no evidence of voter fraud by illegal immigrants.\n\nThe only other person to speak on the topic that day was Angel Taveras, now mayor of Providence, who was at the meeting to represent a client but stressed that he was testifying as a private citizen. He complained that citizenship status was being singled out. \"We should make sure there was NO fraudulent voting,\" he said, predicting that if an investigation is undertaken, \"I think what you're going to find is there is very little, if any, of it.\"\n\nPerez herself, who believes a lot of the votes cast in her district were done by people paid to engage in voter fraud, said she doubts that many undocumented immigrants were engaging in the practice. \"Undocumented people are less likely to run that type of game,\" she said. \"They're not going to take the risk. For $100? Hell no.\"\n\nSo, in summary, when Rowley talks about the \"official testimony from Providence residents who claim to have witnessed known illegal aliens voting,\" his statement implies there were several complaints.\n\nThere weren\u2019t.\n\nThere was just one.\n\nIn 2006.\n\nThere's a grain of truth to his claim. Perez did report one case. But because Rowley substantially overstated the evidence regarding illegal immigrant voting, the Truth-O-Meter rates his statement Mostly False.\n\n(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

Witnessing the behavior can make people uncomfortable, like watching an aging, overweight Elvis mock the memory of the brash young man who had swaggered across cultural color lines.\"That's not exactly an aggressive embrace of the term. But even if McCain is now listening more closely to his inner ambivalence about the term, it cannot erase the eagerness with which his 2008 presidential campaign touted that particular characteristic as a major selling point for candidacy. So we rate his statement that \"I never considered myself a maverick\" to be Pants on Fire!\n\n"}

But the statistics need clarification: more recent figures show job growth and the state\u2019s unemployment rate -- at the time One New Jersey put out its news release -- was not statistically different than the national rate. \u00a0\n\nThe last recession started in December 2007 and ended in June 2009, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. New Jersey hit a prerecession peak of more than 4.08 million jobs in October 2007. The state had about 3.88 million jobs in December, the most recent data available.\n\nThat\u2019s a loss of more than 205,000 jobs.\n\nMost of that job loss occurred while Jon Corzine was governor. Since Christie took office the state has gained jobs, adding more than 38,000 jobs since February 2010, Christie\u2019s first full month in office.\n\nWith that job growth, is One New Jersey right to claim that \"for 12 consecutive months, New Jersey has trailed the rest of America when it comes to unemployment?\"\n\nThat\u2019s a reference to the difference between state and national unemployment rates, according to One New Jersey spokesman Joshua Henne.\n\n\"Since February 2011, for every past month for which numbers are available for both NJ and US, New Jersey has been behind the national rate every month,\" Henne wrote in an email.\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s unemployment rate decreased slightly from 9.1 percent in December 2010 to 9 percent last December.\n\nDuring the same time frame the national unemployment rate dropped from 9.4 percent to 8.5 percent.\n\nIn January 2011, both rates were at 9.1 percent. So the group\u2019s claim is right for 11 consecutive months, not 12.\n\nStill, those differences are not statistically significant, said Ken LeVasseur, a senior economist with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. LeVasseur said New Jersey\u2019s rate may be slightly higher than the nation\u2019s, but \"it\u2019s effectively not different.\"\n\nTo unemployed New Jerseyans, \"the difference in unemployment rates is a heckuva lot more than a question of \u2018statistical significance,\u2019\" Henne said. \"Also, a fact is a fact. Plain and simple, New Jersey lags the nation when it comes to unemployment.\"\n\nOn Feb. 3, after One New Jersey made the statement on New Jersey\u2019s jobs situation, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced the national unemployment rate fell to 8.3 percent in January. \u00a0Updated figures for New Jersey won\u2019t be released until March.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting, as we\u2019ve found previously, that it\u2019s just as unreasonable to blame a state\u2019s governor for job loss as it would be to give him or her credit for job growth. There are too many other factors at work.\n\nOur ruling\n\nOne New Jersey said the state is \"down nearly 200,000 jobs from its pre-recession peak\" and \"for 12 consecutive months, New Jersey has trailed the rest of America when it comes to unemployment.\"\n\nIt\u2019s true the state shed more than 200,000 jobs since its prerecession peak in 2007, but the governor didn\u2019t take office until 2010 and since then that trend has reversed.\n\nNew Jersey's unemployment rate has trailed the national rate for 11 consecutive months, not 12, the difference was never statistically significant and it\u2019s wrong to pin blame for the state\u2019s unemployment problem squarely on Christie.\n\nThe numbers are mostly right, but they need clarification.

Health care stripped from 45,000 children.\"\nThey\u2019re referencing a 2003 budget measure, back when Rossi was the state Senate Ways and Means chairman.\nThe budget was looking bleak, so Republicans proposed large spending cuts that year. One, proposed by Rossi, was a $50 million cut in Medicaid spending. The cut would have eliminated coverage for nearly 40,000 low-income children, according to reporting at the time.\nBut the cut didn\u2019t fly with Democrats, and ended up being scrapped in the final budget. The final budget, which won bipartisan support, wasn't a specific cut, but it did include rules changes. Those changes\u00a0ultimately resulted in the loss of coverage for 45,000 kids on Medicaid.\nWhile it didn\u2019t change any of the eligibility requirements, the budget changed state Medicaid policy in a way that lead to an enrollment decline later reported by state health care agencies. We were unable to trace this measure back to Rossi himself, but he did vote in its favor.\nFirst, it ended continuous eligibility, which meant if a family\u2019s income was over the income standard, the child\u2019s medical coverage would end. Second, certification periods went from every 12 to every six months. A signature became necessary for renewal, ending telephone renewals.

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Barack Obama \"A violent felon can buy (a gun) over the Internet with no background check, no questions asked.\"", "evidence": "Under the current system, dangerous people are able to buy firearms far too often, President Barack Obama said in a speech announcing new executive action on gun policy.\n\"The problem is some gun sellers have been operating under a different set of rules,\" he said Jan. 5. \"A violent felon can buy the exact same weapon over the Internet with no background check, no questions asked.\"\nQuite a few readers flagged Obama\u2019s claim that a violent felon can buy a gun online without a background check, so we decided to fact-check it.\nSome readers seemed to think Obama was suggesting such transactions were legal. We don\u2019t see that in Obama\u2019s comments. (The grammarians at PolitiFact would note that Obama said \"can,\" not \"may.\") To be clear, such a transaction would be illegal. What Obama said is that such transactions are possible. That is accurate, but it\u2019s also a little more complicated than Obama\u2019s comment suggests.\nA big loophole\nFederal law prohibits felons from purchasing or receiving guns unless their rights have been formally restored. However, felons can get around this obstacle by buying guns from sellers who do not require criminal background checks.\n\"Violent felons aren't allowed to buy guns, period,\" said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles. \"But they can take advantage of the loophole in federal law that allows gun sales, including some gun sales over the Internet, to purchase from non-licensed sellers, who don't have to conduct a background check.\"\nAnyone who repeatedly buys and sells firearms \"with the principal motive of making a profit\" has to get a dealer\u2019s license, whether they deal out of a brick-and-mortar store, at a flea market, or online, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Licensed firearm dealers must run background checks on non-licensed buyers before selling them a gun.\nBut the law does not require a dealer\u2019s license for private hobbyists and others who occasionally buy and sell guns for the purpose of enhancing or liquidating a collection. If an individual buys a gun from someone who does not have or require a license, the purchaser does not have to undergo a background check.\nSo a violent felon could buy a gun from a hobbyist over the Internet because he or she would not be subject to a background check. The purchase would still be illegal, because of the buyer\u2019s felon status, but it would not create an immediate red flag. The same thing can happen at a gun show.\nThere are a couple of important limitations on these sorts of online private transactions.\nFirst, private sales, online or otherwise, cannot take place across state lines, so the buyer and seller must be in the same state.\u00a0And there are\u00a0many restrictions on shipping guns, so the actual transfer of the gun is likely to take place in person.\nSecond, it is illegal for private sellers to transfer a gun to someone they either know or reasonably believe is prohibited from owning a gun, for example, if the seller knows the buyer is a felon. But online sellers \"can give themselves plausible deniability by not asking the necessary questions,\" said Garen Wintemute, a professor of emergency medicine at the University of California Davis.\n\n"}

Greg Abbott to the effect that Obama had many times said he couldn\u2019t act to protect immigrants from deportation unless Congress revised immigration laws.\nU.S. Rep.

But Obama had often said through March 2014 that absent congressional action, he couldn\u2019t do more by himself to protect immigrants living in the country without legal permission.\nIn a 2015 interview, Abbott said: \"22 times Barack Obama said he did not have the authority to implement this type of\" anti-deportation \"measure. And then the day after he signed this into law, he said, quote, \u2018I just changed the law.\u2019\" Like McCaul, we found, Abbott overstated the confirmed instances of Obama indicating he couldn\u2019t independently do more to prevent deportations.\nObama\u2019s statements since DAPA\nNotably, those fact-checks were based on statements that Obama made long before announcing DAPA.\nIn contrast, Obama insisted he was within the law when he announced DAPA \u00a0in November 2014 as a follow-up to his administration\u2019s established effort to keep certain young immigrants from being deported (as of June 2017, the older program--Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals--was left intact by the Trump administration). A 2014 memo from the federal Office of Legal Counsel said DAPA fell within Homeland Security\u2019s discretionary powers to enforce immigration laws. That office, in the Justice Department, is responsible for providing authoritative legal advice to the president and executive-branch agencies.\nIn announcing DAPA, Obama changed his declared position on his ability to act unilaterally as PolitiFact noted at the time.\nObama told the country he was launching DAPA to delay deportations of unauthorized immigrants who had lived in the U.S. for more than five years and who had children who were citizens or had green cards. The intent was that if an applicant could pass a background check and pay a fee, he or she could qualify for a work permit and avoid deportation for three years at a time.\nObama also reaffirmed that he\u2019d have preferred Congress act on comprehensive immigration reform. Regardless, he said: \"The actions I\u2019m taking are not only lawful, they\u2019re the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican president and every single Democratic president for the past half century.\"\nAfter Paxton made his 2017 claim, we searched for post-2014 instances of Obama saying he didn\u2019t have the authority to impose the DAPA--and came up empty.\n\n"}

We\u2019re not going to delve into whether Biery is a \"dictatorial religious bigot\" \u2014 that\u2019s Gingrich\u2019s opinion \u2014 or whether his decision on prayer at graduation is an example of the judiciary overstepping its role.\nThe case\nTaking Gingrich\u2019s suggestion in his victory speech, we checked out the 54-page paper on his website, \"Bringing the Courts Back Under the Constitution.\" Its Appendix B is devoted to Biery, chief judge of the federal Western District of Texas, and is headlined: \"Federal district court judge orders the censoring of high school graduation speech.\"\nAt issue: A June 1, 2011, order from Biery granting an agnostic family\u2019s request for a temporary order prohibiting the 3,000-student Medina Valley school district, west of San Antonio, from including a prayer in its high school\u2019s then-pending graduation ceremony.\nGingrich spokesman Joe DeSantis pointed out the order when we asked for the backup for Gingrich\u2019s victory-speech statement.\nIn a May 26, 2011, lawsuit, the family challenged Medina Valley High School\u2019s tradition of having students deliver an invocation and benediction as part of the graduation, a practice that the family said amounted to unconstitutional school-sponsored prayer.\nThe lawsuit, filed on behalf of the family by the Washington-based Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said Christa and Danny Schultz were exposed to the \"unwelcome prayers\" at the high school\u2019s 2009 ceremony, when their oldest child graduated. The couple\u2019s younger son was in the 2011 graduating class.\nThe lawsuit said: \"If the Schultzes were to attend the graduation of their son, they would once again be exposed to the school district\u2019s longstanding practice of presenting prayers as part of graduation ceremonies\" unless the court stopped it.\nThe lawsuit alleged that the graduation prayers violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment \u2014 \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\" \u2014 and included a request that the judge issue an emergency order prohibiting the district \"from including any prayer \u2026 whether denominated an \u2018invocation,\u2019 \u2018benediction,\u2019 or otherwise\" at the graduation on June 4, 2011.\nDuring a May 31, 2011, hearing on the request, Craig Wood, a lawyer representing the school district, argued that with respect to the graduation speeches, the district was adhering to a 2007 state law that Wood said was enacted \"to honor the fact that students do sometimes wish to express religious viewpoints and ought not be penalized for doing so.\"\nWood was referring to the Texas Religious Viewpoints Anti-discrimination Act, which requires each school district to adopt a policy enabling student speakers at school events, including graduation ceremonies, to voluntarily express a religious viewpoint. At graduations, the law says, districts must \"state, in writing, orally, or both, that the student's speech does not reflect the endorsement, sponsorship, position, or expression of the district.\"\n\"We're attempting to balance those First Amendment interests of all parties involved,\" Wood told Biery. \"And I will acknowledge, your honor, in a community like Medina Valley, it is not unusual for there to be a student selected (to speak at graduation) who would, in fact, make some sort of reference to some sort of religious deity. I will also tell you that in the last couple of years that the closing remarks made by the student had no religious connotation whatsoever.\"\nBy the end of the hearing, Biery had made it clear that he planned to grant the Schultzes\u2019 request, articulating in court essentially what appeared the following day in his injunction.

And they can make a personal statement of their own belief. I think that's certainly acceptable.\"\nThe order\nBiery\u2019s order, dated June 1, says the district and \"its officials, agents, servants, and employees, as well as all persons acting in concert with them, are prohibited from allowing a prayer (as defined in paragraph (b) below) to be included\" in the ceremony.\nParagraph b mandates that:\n** the district instruct the students chosen to deliver the \"invocation\" and \"benediction\" to change their remarks to be \"statements of their own beliefs as opposed to leading the audience in prayer.\"\n** everyone scheduled to speak at the graduation be instructed not to present a prayer, \"to wit, they shall be instructed that they may not ask audience members to \u2018stand,\u2019 \u2018join in prayer,\u2019 or \u2018bow their heads,\u2019 they may not end their remarks with \u2018amen\u2019 or \u2018in [a deity\u2019s name] we pray,\u2019 and they shall not otherwise deliver a message that would commonly be understood to be a prayer, nor use the word \u2018prayer\u2019 unless it is used in the student\u2019s expression of the student\u2019s personal belief, as opposed to encouraging others who may not believe in the concept of prayer to join in and believe the same concept.\"\nAt the end of paragraph B, Biery says that \"in stating their own personal beliefs,\" students may \"speak through conduct such as kneeling to face Mecca, the wearing of a yarmulke or hijab or making the sign of the cross.\"\nAlso in the order, Biery says that the district must remove the terms \"invocation\" and \"benediction\" from the \"program of ceremonies for the graduation exercises\" and that they are to be replaced with \"opening remarks\" and \"closing remarks.\"\nFinally, the order says the injunction goes into effect immediately and \"shall be enforced by incarceration or other sanctions for contempt of court if not obeyed by district official(s) and their agents.\"\nThe fact-check\nSo how does Gingrich\u2019s statement describing Biery\u2019s order stand up?

No, this rumor is wildly overblown. Here\u2019s how it came about.\nIn 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. Michelle Obama was a high-profile supporter of the measure -- she joined her husband in speaking at the bill-signing ceremony -- after it passed the Senate by unanimous consent and the House by a fairly (but not perfectly) party-line vote.\nThe law included a provision (section 223) for a Study on Nutrition and Wellness Quality in Childcare Settings, or SNAQCS. The study was designed to look at four topics: the nutritional quality of foods offered, the amount of physical activity, the amount of sedentary activity\u00a0and the ways that child care centers and family day care homes can improve their performance on these metrics.\nOn March 23, 2015, the U.S. Department of Agriculture released details on the proposed study, along with a request for public comments.\n\"Good nutrition is a key to proper childhood development, but not enough is known about the food children are eating in child care and related programs,\" the document reads.

The USDA document says it will involve an estimated 3,000 children, 3,753 staff members at child care centers, family day care homes\u00a0and after-school childcare providers, and 4,175 parents.\n\n"}

The gross debt was about $15.2 trillion on the day the congressman made his statement, according to data from the U.S. Treasury Department.\n\nJoe Hack, Forbes\u2019 spokesman, said the congressman used census data to break down the debt load to per-person and per-household shares.\n\nHack referred us to the U.S. Census population clock, which continuously updates the estimated number of people living in the the nation. On Feb. 1, the clock showed the U.S. population was 312.9 million.\n\nWhen you divide the amount the U.S. owes creditors by the population, \u00a0the national debt equals $48,686. So Forbes, rounding up, is right in saying the debt comes to $48,700 per person.\n\nNow, let\u2019s turn to households. There were 118.7 million of them in the U.S. in March 2011, according to the most current Census Bureau estimate. Doing the math, that means the debt per household comes to $128,378 -- just above Forbes\u2019 calculation of $128,300.\n\nStill, Forbes is comparing a January 2012 debt figure to a March 2011 household number. We found a sure-fire way to make an updated estimate.\n\nThe Census 2012 Abstract of the United States shows that the size of the average household was 2.6 people in 1990, 2000 and 2010. So we divided 312.9 million (the Feb. 1, 2012 U.S. population tally) by 2.6, and arrived at 120.4 million households. That would equal $126,585 of debt per household at the of this month -- pretty close to the number Forbes cited.\n\nBut if the debt comes $48,700 per person, does that mean each individual in the U.S. would end up paying that amount to make the nation whole?\n\nBill Frenzel, a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution, said the answer is no.\n\nThe debt is owed by the U.S. government, which ultimately pays up through its ability to tax, said Frenzel, a former Republican congressman.\n\n\"We as individual citizens will pay for that debt in quite differing amounts,\" Frenzel said.\n\nFrenzel, the former ranking member of the House Budget Committee, used multi-billionaire Warren Buffett as an example. The overall amount Buffett would pay in taxes would be much higher than Americans of lesser means, he said.\n\nBreaking down the debt by person and household creates a \"gee whiz\" number aimed at grabbing people\u2019s attention, Frenzel said. \"The problem is that $15 trillion is such a big number that it doesn\u2019t mean anything to anybody,\" he added.\n\nPatrick Louis Knudsen, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, echoed that sentiment. But he said it would be better to measure debt not by its gross total, but rather by the amount of \"publicly-held\" debt.\n\n\"That\u2019s how much the government actually owes to outside entities,\" Knudsen said.\n\nOn the day Forbes made his statement, publicly-held debt was about $10.5 trillion. Running the numbers again, that would equal to $33,470 per person or $87,023 per household.\n\nEconomists have told PolitiFact in recent years that publicly-held debt as well as the gross national debt tally are each valid measures of the nation\u2019s debt load.\n\nWhat about Forbes\u2019 last contention -- that the national debt is equivalent to the size of the U.S. economy?\n\nHack cited data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis showing that the average U.S. Gross Domestic Product -- the market value of all final goods and services produced -- was $15.1 trillion throughout all of 2011. That\u2019s just below the total debt level of $15.2 trillion.\n\nThe BEA data also shows that for the last three months of last year, the GDP came in at $15.3 trillion. Still, when talking about such large numbers, that\u2019s roughly equal to the size of the national debt.\n\nOur ruling:\n\nForbes said the national debt is equal to $48,700 per person and $128,300 per household. He also said the debt is equivalent to the size as the U.S. economy.\n\nOn all three scores, he\u2019s pretty much on target"}
{"label": "true", "claim": "Barack Obama \"We are making the largest investment in education in our nation\u2019s history.\"", "evidence": "As President Obama signed the $787 billion stimulus bill, he said it marked a historic investment in education.\u00a0\n\"Because we know America can't outcompete the world tomorrow if our children are being outeducated today, we're making the largest investment in education in our nation's history,\" Obama said at a bill signing ceremony at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science on Feb. 17, 2009.\nThat's quite a claim \u2014 the largest ever?\nIt's true that a substantial chunk of the stimulus is targeted to education. U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan said in  this press release  that the bill \"provides more than $100 billion in education funding and college grants and tuition tax credits, as well as billions more for school modernization.\"\nThis   chart  from the Wall Street Journal indicates $115 billion of the $787 billion goes to education in one way or another. That includes, among other things, $22 billion for school construction and repair, $41 billion for states to balance education budgets, $650 million for computer and science labs, $17 billion for Pell Grants, and $14 million for Education Department spending oversight (which we dare say seems like money well spent in light of what precedes it). That money will be spent over the next two years, a spokesman told us.\nFor Obama to even be in the ballpark of being the largest ever, we have to\u00a0assume that he was comparing the funding to prior spending by the  federal  government exclusively. It's important to realize that the vast majority of money spent on education in this country is spent by states and localities. Of the money spent at the elementary and secondary level, over 91 percent comes from nonfederal sources, according to the Education Department. Even $115 billion won't change that balance substantially.\nSo we'll assume that Obama meant the largest single investment by the federal government.\n\n"}
{"label": "false", "claim": "Lon Burnam Says rejecting federal aid to expand Medicaid in Texas will \"send $9 billion in federal taxes paid by Texans to other states to insure their working poor.\"", "evidence": "State Rep. Lon Burnam, D-Fort Worth, said the Texas House was throwing money away when it voted March 4, 2013, to reject federal Medicaid expansion dollars.\n\nIn a press release, Burnam said refusing to expand would accomplish nothing except to \"send $9 billion in federal taxes paid by Texans to other states to insure their working poor.\"\n\nMedicaid is a federal-state insurance program that targets children and low-income families, elderly and disabled people, pregnant women and children in foster care. Under the Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare), the federal government would pay all costs for the first three years for Texas and other states that extend Medicaid to households making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 which in 2013 is $15,865 for an individual, $32,499 for a family of four.\n\nTo offset such federal costs, congressional Democrats wrote new taxes into the law, primarily on the wealthy and on the health care industry, alongside a number of measures intended to reduce the growth of Medicare spending.\n\nTexas officials have estimated that from 2014 through 2023, the state would receive $79 billion in federal money to cover the adults who are newly eligible under the higher income limit. Because states begin paying a share of the costs after three years (gradually rising from 5 percent in 2017 to 10 percent in 2020 and beyond), Texas would chip in an estimated $8.8 billion over ten years from its own general revenue fund.\n\nBurnam spokesman Conor Kenny told us by email that Burnam\u2019s number was based on another state estimate for the same 10 years: $90.6 billion, which includes the $79 billion in Medicaid expansion money plus $11.6 billion the feds will send Texas to help cover people who are already Medicaid-eligible but not enrolled. Those folks will have to sign up for insurance plans when Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate kicks in Jan. 1, 2014.\n\nBurnam\u2019s $9 billion figure, Kenny said, was the average amount of federal money coming in per year ($90.6 billion divided by 10) calculated in Feb. 6, 2013, legislative testimony from the liberal, Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities.\n\nBoth the $79 billion in expansion money and the $90.6 billion total for expansion plus newly-enrolled-but-already-eligible Texans are 2012 estimates from the state Health and Human Services Commission, which administers Medicaid. Spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman sent us a March 8, 2013, presentation from the agency and a spreadsheet with estimated year-by-year federal and state costs.\n\nBurnam also relied, Kenny said, on part of Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer\u2019s Jan. 14, 2013, state-of-the-state speech, in which she said not expanding Medicaid would mean that $2 billion of \"Arizona\u2019s tax dollars would simply be passed to another state \u2013 generating jobs and providing health care for citizens in California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico or any other expansion state.\" Her office did not respond to our inquiries about Brewer\u2019s basis for the statements. Kenny also said that he had talked to Edwin Park, vice president of health policy at the liberal Washington-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nFirst, a misconception: Burnam referred to \"$9 billion in federal taxes paid by Texans,\" much as Brewer referred to $2 billion in Arizona tax dollars. But the money a state gets won\u2019t come directly from the federal taxes its own residents paid.\n\nExperts told us that federal payments to states for expanding their Medicaid programs -- some 25 states had signed on when Burnam spoke -- will come out of the U.S. Treasury, where everybody\u2019s tax dollars go to mingle. So in a general sense, Texas dollars might be a part of any Medicaid expansion payment to any state. There\u2019s just no telling which paid-in-Texas federal taxes go where.\n\nAnd money won\u2019t be sent from one state to another, the experts told us. In fact, there\u2019s no dedicated dollar amount for Medicaid expansion. Rather, the states will be sent federal money for new participants as they come in.\n\n"}

Health experts say you can blame Obamacare and Covered California for that long wait and they say it's only going to get worse. One of the promised benefits of the Affordable Care Act was to reduce the pressure on emergency rooms by expanding Medicaid and giving the poor better access to primary care. But instead, a survey by the American College of Emergency Physicians suggests something else. The organization says President Obama's health care reform actually has had a destructive effect on the nation's emergency rooms.\" (The version that aired is archived here.)\nBut when we took a closer look, we found several problems -- including that the alleged 5-hour wait time was measured before the health care law took effect.\nWhat does 'average E.R. wait' mean?\nActually, there isn\u2019t just one definition. A study published in October 2013 by the California HealthCare Foundation offered three different measurements. The one Priebus references is \"patient arrival to being admitted to hospital as inpatient.\" For California, this wait was five hours and 26 minutes -- longer than the national average of four hours and 34 minutes.\nBut this is by far the longest of the three measures. The second longest is \"patient arrival to emergency room departure for discharged patients\" -- basically, the entire length of the visit for someone who isn\u2019t actually admitted as an inpatient after being seen by the E.R. For Californians, this wait time was two hours and 49 minutes, once again a bit higher than the national average of two hours and 19 minutes.\nThe third measurement is by far the shortest -- \"patient arrival to being seen by health care professional.\" In California, this was 31 minutes, slightly more than the national average of 29 minutes.\nOne might take away from Priebus\u2019 tweet that someone going to a California E.R. can expect a wait of more than five hours just to get in to see a doctor or a nurse. In reality, they\u2019re seeing a health professional in about a half an hour -- and if their injury or illness isn\u2019t serious enough to keep them in the hospital overnight, then they\u2019re on their way home in under three hours. For those patients, their entire visit is much shorter than the five hours Priebus indicates.\nSteven Birenbaum, a spokesman for the California HealthCare Foundation, said the wait time to see a health professional -- the shortest of the three measures -- is actually the most useful statistic in this context, because the longer figure \"mainly reflects the inpatient service and how full the hospitals is.\"\nJulie Lloyd, a spokeswoman for the American College of Emergency Physicians, said there\u2019s no \"definitive answer\" on which measurement is better. Her group focuses more on the wait time to admission or discharge, but she said hospitals market themselves based on wait time to see a doctor. The wait time to see a doctor is likely more familiar to ordinary Americans.\n\n"}

With coal miners standing behind him, Romney attacked the Obama administration saying the Democratic president was developing alternative energy at the expense of the coal industry and heavy-handed in regulating the energy resource.\n\nCharges that Democrats have hurt the coal industry have spread to Ohio Senate's race, too. During a U.S. Senate debate held by the City Club of Cleveland on Oct. 16, a questioner asked incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown how he could support jobs and cheaper energy in Ohio while backing a president that has declared war on coal.\n\nBrown fired back saying the \"war on coal\" rhetoric is empty.\n\n\"There is no war on coal. Period. There are more coal jobs and more coal produced in Ohio than there were five years ago, in spite of the talking points and the yard signs,\" he told the audience.\n\nHas coal production and the number of coal mining jobs in Ohio really gone up during the time Obama has been in office? PoltiFact Ohio got out the pickaxes and started digging for facts.\n\nFirst, we turned to Brown's campaign to find out the source of Brown's information.\n\nBrown campaign spokesman Justin Barasky sent us some information from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources annual coal reports showing that production in 2010 was 28,364,000 tons compared to 22,283,072 tons in 2007. Those same ODNR-produced reports show the monthly employment average for coal mining jobs in Ohio in 2010 was 2,879, compared to a monthly average of 2,204 in 2007.\n\nWith the 2011 state coal report due out any day, ODNR spokeswoman Heidi Hetzel-Evans was able to tell us that the 2011 report will show that Ohio produced about 27,929,089 tons of coal--a slight drop from the 2010 data that Brown was basing his comment on. Coal mining jobs in Ohio in 2011 were up over the previous year with an average of 2,995 a month, and obviously, both are well ahead of 2007 figures.\n\nPolitiFact Ohio also checked with the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which provided a second source of data with even more recent numbers. The EIA estimates coal production for every state on a weekly basis and the October 13 report showed Ohio coal production so far this year up about 1.9 percent over last year.\n\nFor the most recent 12 months, from October 13, 2011, to October 13, 2012, Ohio has produced about 28,456,000 tons of coal. That matches up fairly closely with the ODNR reports and certainly shows that there hasn't been any fall off in coal production in Ohio in recent months.\n\nWe also looked for a second source on the coal mining jobs numbers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics keeps a Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages which tracks job numbers in specific industries. For Ohio, the census data showed an average of 2,570 coal mining jobs statewide in 2011.\n\nThat's almost 30 percent higher than 2007 when the bureau showed only 2,010 coal mining jobs in Ohio. Counted in those statistics are jobs related to the actual mining of coal as well as developing coal mining sites and preparing the coal such as cleaning and screening the coal to be sold.\n\nSo why has production of Ohio's high-sulfur coal increased in the last few years?\n\nCoal industry analysts generally attribute the jump in coal production to an increase in exports to overseas markets such as China and India, which need coal for cheap energy and to use \u00a0in the steel-making process.\n\nSo after mining for facts what are we left with?\n\nIn defending the Democratic record on coal during a debate, Sherrod Brown said coal production and coal jobs in Ohio are up compared to five years ago. After consulting with state and federal statistics, it appears that jobs and coal production in Ohio have increased compared to 2007 levels by every measurement we could find"}

People watched helplessly as investment nest eggs cracked, leaving many -- particularly seniors -- worried they would never recover what they had dutifully built up in savings.\n\nThat raw fear is exploited in a new statewide television ad paid for by the Republican Party of Florida on behalf of the Rick Scott for governor campaign and against Democrat Alex Sink. The 30-second ad began airing on Sept. 21, 2010. It opens with black and white photos of older people as a narrator says: \"You worked your whole life. You saved. It's your pension. You earned it. But with Alex Sink in charge, Florida\u2019s pension fund has lost 24 billion dollars. That's not a typo. $24 billion -- gone.\"\n\nThe ad continues: \"Experts even warned Sink she was making risky investments. Sink gave bonuses to staffers. They were hired to invest our seniors' money. Lost billions. Then Sink gave them bonuses. And now she wants a promotion?\"\n\nIt's less than six weeks to the election, and television is loaded with ads that take facts or issues out of context. The Associated Press labeled the RPOF ad \"deceptive,\" and, within hours of its release, the Sink campaign sent out an e-mail statement firing back. That statement targeted Scott, claiming that the Florida pension fund lost money when his former company, Columbia/HCA, was hit with fraud charges and the pension fund had to sue his company.\n\nTo get to the truth and put the GOP ad in perspective, there are four questions to probe here. One is: Did the Florida pension fund lose $24 billion and is it \"gone?\" A second is whether Sink was \"in charge?\" Did experts warn her \"she was making risky investments?\" And, did Sink give \"bonuses to staffers\" who lost billions?\n\nLet\u2019s start with some background. Sink is Florida\u2019s chief financial officer and is required by law to sit as one of three members of the \u00a0Board of Trustees on the State Board of Administration. The board has oversight authority over the state's largest pension fund, known as the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund. The other members of the board are Gov. Charlie Crist and Attorney General Bill McCollum.\n\nLosses\n\nThe trust fund is a massive investment account, today worth about $117 billion and holding the retirement assets of about 1 million current and retired state employees, as well as some local police and firefighters. It is one of the largest retirement funds in the nation, even the world. According to the last actuarial report completed in 2009, the fund is 88.5 percent funded -- meaning if every employee retired today, they would get 88.5 percent of their retirement benefits. A funding level of 80 percent is considered healthy.\n\nSo when Wall Street melted down, and stocks, bonds, real estate and other assets began their steep decline in 2008, the value of Florida's retirement fund fell, too. Did the retirement fund lose $24 billion? RPOF does the math this way: On June 30, 2007, the fund was at its peak at $138.4 billion and by June 30, 2010, the value had declined to $109.34 billion, a $29 billion drop in value.\n\n"}

{"label": "true", "claim": "JoEllen Smith Cobb is one of the largest school systems (in the nation) that is debt free.", "evidence": "On Tuesday, Cobb County residents will go to the polls to vote on a fourth installment of the school system\u2019s sales tax plan.\n\nThe 1-cent special purpose local option sales tax, or SPLOST (E-SPLOST when the tax program is conducted by and for a school system), will be collected for five years beginning in 2014. The system expects to bring in about $717.8 million in tax collections to pay for a host of capital projects.\n\nOpponents of the program say the project list includes unnecessary items that the district \"wants\" but doesn\u2019t need, and that E-SPLOST renewals have become the \"crack cocaine\" of the school system. School system administrators and tax supporters argue that the tax is a good alternative to property tax increases. In addition to that, supporters say, the E-SPLOST has long helped the system\u2019s bottom line by providing money to pay off long-term debts and avoid new bond debt for system projects.\n\n\"Cobb is also one of the largest school systems that is debt free,\" education activist JoEllen Smith said in a newspaper editorial published in a local paper last month. \"If SPLOST doesn\u2019t pass, bonds will have to be issued or reserves used.\"\n\nPolitiFact Georgia wondered if that enviable position was indeed true. It\u2019s hard for most people to pay off personal consumer debt, let alone a school system responsible for funding the educational needs of just over 108,000 students.\n\nThe district, the second largest in the state, has an 11-minute website video that includes the debt-free claim. And some Kennesaw businessmen, Jay Cunningham of Superior Plumbing and John Loud of Loud Security Systems, are featured in a SPLOST advocacy video also making the debt claim.\n\nSmith is a volunteer for EmpowerED Georgia, a group of parents and teachers that estimates its membership at 3,500. She and Cobb Schools spokesman Jay Dillon pointed us to a 2010 census education finance report. That report, issued in June 2012, was taken from 2010 data tables that were updated in November 2012 and collected from each state. Using the updated data, Cobb is listed as the 23rd-largest school system in the country (of the more than 14,000 listed) based on enrollment. Gwinnett County Public Schools -- Georgia\u2019s largest school system -- is ranked 14th.\n\nThe report shows that Cobb has zero long-term outstanding debt at the end of the fiscal year. The system also has no short-term debt, Dillon said. Gwinnett is not in the same fortunate financial position as Cobb. Gwinnett still has almost $580 million in debt on the books to be paid off, a schools spokesman told us. That county funds its construction projects through a portion of property tax collections, and will use current E-SPLOST revenue to pay off bonds that were used to finance some projects.\n\nThe census report showed that Clayton County was the only other metro Atlanta school system without any long-term debt. Clayton County Public Schools, ranked 88th in size, paid off its last bond debt as part of a SPLOST passed in 1998, a district spokesman told PolitiFact Georgia.\n\nCobb\u2019s current five-year E-SPLOST expires Dec. 31, 2013. Approval from voters next week would keep the sales tax collections continuous through 2018. The money is expected to pay for several new gyms, theaters and wings, along with 407 new classrooms, at schools throughout the district.\n\nGetting approval from voters could be a challenge. In 2011, a four-year extension of the county\u2019s SPLOST for parks, recreation and road renovation throughout Cobb passed by only 79 votes. And a 10-year regional transportation SPLOST failed in Cobb by almost 38 percentage points.\n\nPaying for capital projects, like new schools and classroom expansions, with E-SPLOST funds is quite common in Georgia, said Herb Garrett, executive director of the Georgia School Superintendents Association.\n\nBefore the E-SPLOST legislation was passed, school systems had to pay for projects through their operating funds intended for day-to-day expenses, or through bonds. Under the bond method, the money was immediately available but was paid back with interest over several years, instead of the pay-as-you-go method of financing projects with E-SPLOST collections.\n\nUsing E-SPLOST funds, Cobb Schools paid off $184 million in bond debt in 2007. The school system has incurred no additional debt since then, meaning it has no outstanding bonds or loans, a state Education Department spokeswoman told us.\n\n\"The SPLOST program has allowed a rapidly growing state to meet its need for school buildings,\" Garrett said.\n\nSo what\u2019s the fiscal fallout?\n\nEducation activist and education sales tax supporter JoEllen Smith said that Cobb County Schools is one of the largest systems in the nation that is debt free.\n\nThe district is the second largest in the state, and is the 23rd largest in the country, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nCobb Schools has used previous sales tax collections to pay off long-term bond debt, which education experts said is common practice in Georgia. This pay-as-you-go system of funding projects has kept the county school system debt free"}

Cuomo used a message of necessity to hasten passage of the law. The SAFE Act has several provisions, including a ban on certain semiautomatic weapons, a requirement that ammunition be purchased through a dealer who performs a background check on the buyer, and background checks for buyers who purchase guns through private sales. The act also included provisions to keep guns away from people with mental illness. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence called it a \"model for the nation.\" Some of the law\u2019s provisions were challenged in court, including a provision that magazine capacity be seven rounds instead of 10, which a federal judge struck down. Other legal challenges to the law were not successful.\nThough the SAFE Act\u00a0was controversial in parts of the state, Cuomo has continued to pursue gun control policies during his tenure. His actions have attracted negative attention from the country\u2019s most powerful gun rights group, the National Rifle Association, as he pursues a third term.\nBut is it the toughest? \nCuomo calls the SAFE Act the toughest gun legislation in the country.

The Affordable Care Act - or Obamacare - promised the federal government would pay all expansion costs at first, and never less than 90%.\u00a0\nRepublican leaders - including outgoing Gov. Bob McDonnell and then-Speaker Bill\u00a0 Howell - declared their opposition in early 2013, saying they didn\u2019t trust the federal pledge to pick up most of the expansion costs\u00a0and that Virginia\u2019s program was too inefficient to let grow. The state\u2019s Medicaid costs during the previous decade had grown an average 9% a year, according to\u00a0the Joint Subcommittee for Health and Human Resources.\nJones was on a team of budget negotiators that year that created a commission to find efficiencies in Virginia\u2019s program that might open the door to future expansion.\nDemocrat Terry McAuliffe became governor in 2014 and made Medicaid expansion a top priority, accusing Republicans of turning down a federal windfall. Jones told reporters that January, \"I don\u2019t see any possibility of expansion this session,\" and repeated his reforms-first mantra.\u00a0\nJones\u00a0undercut McAuliffe\u2019s efforts to work expansion into the state budget and opposed it in a partisan floor vote.

Scott Walker.\nOne of the first topics to emerge was college affordability.\nState Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling, D-La Crosse, called for state legislation to enable student loan borrowers to refinance their student loans.\nRefinancing, of course, allows you to get a lower interest rate on an existing loan when interest rates drop.\nState Rep.

{"label": "true", "claim": "Bob Gibbs \"Water transportation is the most fuel efficient, least polluting, safest, and least expensive means of moving cargo.\"", "evidence": "Rep. Bob Gibbs is a big proponent of water transportation.\n\nAs chair of the House Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment (part of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure) he recently held a hearing on the soundness of the country\u2019s inland waterway system, which includes the Ohio River.\n\nGibbs, a Republican from Holmes County, finds the system lacking. Deferred maintenance resulting from budget constraints on the U.S. Corps of Engineers increases the likelihood of a calamity befalling the system, he said at the April 18 hearing.\n\nIf improvements aren\u2019t made, it could doom the country\u2019s inland water system, he said, and that would be a costly bit of negligence because water transportation is a vital cog in our economy.\n\n\"Water transportation is the most fuel efficient, least polluting, safest, and least expensive means of moving cargo,\" \u00a0he said.\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty definitive statement. PolitiFact Ohio decided to check it out.\n\nFirst of all, Gibbs was referring to inland waterways and their barge traffic that runs north and south along major navigable rivers, such as the Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio.\n\nRiver barges usually carry large volumes of low-value commodities, such as grain and coal. They compete to varying degrees with railroads and trucks, but more often than not they work in tandem. Ninety percent of all barge traffic depends on a connection with either rail or truck, said Chris Dager, research economist at the University of Tennessee.\n\nTrillions of dollars of freight moves each year over the country\u2019s transportation network, which includes 4 million miles of highways and roads, 140,000 miles of rail and 25,000 of commercially navigable waterways.\n\nThe problem with a blanket statement that any form of transportation is the cheapest or safest is that it can vary depending on the circumstances.\n\nA commodities broker shipping corn from Iowa to New Orleans, for example, would send it by barge down the Mississippi, not by rail or truck. It will take longer to ship \u2014 the down river speed is about 9 mph \u2014 but cost far less. But if time is of the essence, or if a river with loading terminals isn\u2019t handy, rail or truck may be the only feasible options.\n\nOver-the-road delivery has a cost advantage at times because a trucker can drop off a load hundreds of miles away and usually find something to haul back on his return trip. That\u2019s known as back-hauling and while it occurs usually 90 percent of the time with long-haul trucks, the rate is only 45 to 50 percent for barges, said Larry Bray, a research economist at University of Tennessee.\n\nRailroads, on the other hand, usually return with empty cars, except for containers and boxcars.\n\nAnd some areas of a river are more efficient than others. On the lower Mississippi River, barges move along unimpeded, but on the upper reaches they move more slowly because of multiple dams and locks.\n\nAnd when it comes to delays, some rail and highway locations are legendary for their congestion. \u00a0\n\nWith all that in mind, let\u2019s consider some numbers.\n\nAs of 2010, a river barge could transport an average of 640 tons of cargo per mile on a gallon of diesel, Dager said, thanks to recent improvements that include barges with deeper drafts and computer systems that provide up-to-the-minute profiles of a river bottom.\n\nRailroads have made their own improvements, including larger railcars, better engines, and improved business modeling. They can now carry an average of 490 ton-miles of cargo per gallon of diesel, according to Dager.\n\nTrucks are the least fuel efficient, with an average of 75-to-150 ton-miles per gallon of diesel, depending on how far they travel.\n\nIn addition, some social costs aren\u2019t passed along to the consumer that need to be acknowledged. These include government subsidies for infrastructure (something trucks benefit from greatly, waterborne vessels to a much less extent, and railroads the least), congestion, and the effects on health and safety.\n\nThose costs in the aggregate are highest for trucks, followed by rail and then water transportation, according to a 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office called \"Surface Freight Transportation: A Comparison of the costs of Road, Rail, and Waterways Freight Shipments That Are Not Passed on to Consumers.\"\n\nAnd then there\u2019s this statement from Mitchell Moss, director of the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University\u2019s Wagner Graduate School of Public Service: \"Water transportation is one of the most economical ways to move cargo, especially bulk cargo.\"\n\nWhile there are comparative advantages to each mode of transportation, Moss said, on average water is the least expensive and most fuel efficient.\n\nSo, it appears that Gibbs was correct when he said water transportation is the most fuel efficient way to move cargo, as well as the least expensive. He also said water transportation was the cleanest and safest way to move cargo. Those specific factors also are addressed in the GAO report.\n\nThe report states that trucks generate 238 pounds of particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less per million ton-miles of freight delivered. That compares to 36 pounds for rail locomotives and 23 pounds for waterborne vessels.\n\nTrucks also generate more than 6,000 pounds tons of nitrogen oxide per million ton-miles, compared with nearly 1,350 pounds for locomotives and about 938 pounds for waterborne vessels.\n\nAnd when it comes to greenhouse gases, barges spew forth the least amount.\n\nFinally, water transportation accounts for fewer accidents and injuries per ton-mile of delivered freight than trucks and rail, according to the GAO.\n\nGibbs said that water transportation is the cheapest, safest, cleanest and most fuel efficient way to move cargo. Clearly, it\u2019s the most fuel efficient on average. It\u2019s also safer and cleaner.\n\nAs for the expense, because barge traffic is so dependent on rail and trucking, those two modes of transportation could have an impact. But that said, the experts we talked to were persuasive that on average, water transportation is least expensive"}

So far, unlike last year, the roll-out has been smooth. This hasn\u2019t made Republicans a whit more fond of the law. Many want\u00a0to repeal and replace it.\nJust before sign-ups began, liberal pundit and MSNBC show host Ed Schultz challenged Republicans to make good on that line. Schultz said he\u2019s yet to see a fully fleshed out GOP alternative. Several bills spell out key elements of a Republican approach, but their full scope and impact remain unclear. Schultz zeroed in on this lack of precision.\n\"The Republican agenda seems to want to reverse everything on health care,\" Schultz said on Nov. 13, 2014. \"This is what (Sen. Minority Leader Mitch) McConnell wants to repeal. 10 million people. 10.3 uninsured Americans have received coverage since Oct. 1, 2013. That's a hard number that can be verified.\"\nSchultz picked Oct. 1, 2013, because that was the day the federal health insurance exchange opened (as best it could) for business.\nWould, as Schultz said, repeal of the Affordable Care Act take away the health coverage gained by 10.3 million people?\nThe baseline numbers suggest Schultz is correct.\nBetween October 2013 and June 2014, Gallup found that 10.3 million nonelderly adults gained health insurance coverage. It\u2019s possible that this number has grown since the data cut off in June 2014.\nThe New England Journal of Medicine estimated that, through June, 10.3 million adults gained health insurance coverage. Also through June, the Commonwealth Fund estimated the number at 9.5 million. And over the same period, the Urban Institute offered an estimate of 8 million.\nAn earlier study -- through March -- by the RAND Corp. estimated a net gain of 9.3 million American adults with health insurance.\nThese are net figures, meaning they include people who may have lost insurance. While there is some fluctuation, they largely support Schultz\u2019s claim.\nThe more difficult question to answer is, does the Affordable Care Act deserve all the credit?\nThere are generally three ways people were added to the rolls of the insured since October 2013 -- through an employer, through Medicaid or through federal or state marketplaces. There are scenarios in each category whereby people gaining insurance could see their health care taken away if Obamacare is repealed, and there are scenarios where their health care would remain.\nInsurance through an employer\nThe RAND survey \u2014 which will soon be updated \u2014 estimated that millions of newly insured Americans got coverage through an employer (Employer-sponsored insurance or ESI).\nWhy? Partly because of the Affordable Care Act, and partly because the economy is improving and more people are finding work.\n\"Enrollment in ESI increased by 8.2 million,\" the RAND analysts wrote, \"Most of this increase was driven by people who were previously uninsured. Some of these newly insured individuals may have taken up an employer plan as a result of the incentive created by the individual mandate; others may have newly found a job.\"\nSince employer coverage provides most of the insurance in America, and unemployment dropped during this period, at least a portion of the newly insured would have gained coverage without Obamacare.\n\n"}

His staff made the calculation using the Forbes 400 list, which tracks net wealth of the world\u2019s richest people. We won\u2019t recreate the whole list here, but the top-14 includes the likes of Microsoft founder Bill Gates, investor Warren Buffett and members of the Walton family, who founded Wal-Mart.\nOne minor thing -- Sanders\u2019 list accidentally left out Alice Walton, ranked No. 8, but included Google co-founder Sergey Brin, ranked No. 15. We calculated it both ways (with Walton and without Brin, and vice versa), and the difference was negligible, so we won\u2019t take issue with that minor discrepancy.\nForbes data shows that the 14 wealthiest Americans were collectively worth $450.3 billion in March 2013. As of March 2015, they are worth $607.4 billion. That\u2019s a difference of $157.1 billion.\nThe biggest leap was that of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who went from a net worth of $13.3 billion in 2013 to $33.4 billion today. That\u2019s a $20.1 billion change.\nDoes their wealth go untouched by the Republican budget? It\u2019s really hard to say.\nThe Republican budget\nThe first question is whether the Republican budget proposals -- one out of the House, another out of the Senate -- reduce the deficit. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan government research agency, says they would.\nIn a recent report, CBO found that the Senate Republican proposal would reduce the deficit by $4.9 trillion over 10 years, compared to the baseline. (The baseline assumes current law continues without any change.) Another report found that the House Republican proposal -- which passed the chamber -- would reduce the deficit by $5.3 trillion over 10 years.\nIn broad strokes, the proposals say they accomplish deficit reduction through a combination of spending cuts (such as repealing the Affordable Care Act) of about $5 trillion and closing tax loopholes. The proposals also say they will not raise taxes on anyone at any income level -- they assume that revenue over the next 10 years will be about what it is expected to be under current law.\n\"Along with lower rates, we propose broadening the tax base by closing special interest loopholes that distort economic activity,\" the House proposal reads, without getting any more specific.\n\n"}

But their future is potentially brighter than ever.

That term sheet will provide the foundation for more negotiations later on any binding agreement between the GWCCA and the Falcons.\n\nLeft to be decided is who pays for the project. The latest funding plan has the Falcons contributing most of the money for construction, along with an upfront public contribution of $200 million paid through bonds issued by Atlanta\u2019s economic development agency. The bonds would be backed with hotel-motel tax money.\n\nWhile those negotiations continue, state Sen. Vincent Fort , D-Atlanta, questioned another part of the project: minority business participation. \"What concerns me is there is only two sentences (in the term sheet) that have been written about minority business,\" Fort said in a Twitter post earlier this month.\n\nWe wondered whether Fort\u2019s comments about the 24-page document were correct and what this meant for the project.\n\nThe term sheet for the stadium project is available on the Georgia World Congress Center website. On page five of the term sheet under a category titled \"Additional Considerations,\" the first of four bulleted items addresses minority businesses.\n\n\"The Falcons and GWCCA will adopt a M/WBE participation program to be included in design and construction contract requirements pursuant to all applicable and/or customary governmental M/WBE requirements or guidelines.\"\n\nThe one-sentence item is three lines long, so Fort is mostly correct on the simple logistics of the statement. But he appears to have a larger concern.\n\nThe federal government requires state and local governments to implement the federal disadvantaged business enterprise program if they receive federal money for transportation projects. The program is meant to level the playing field for businesses that are disadvantaged because of income or other factors when competing for federal dollars. Many state and local governments also establish their own programs for disadvantaged or minority and women-owned businesses in sectors outside transportation, and they set goals for contracts awarded to those businesses.\n\nPolitiFact Georgia submitted questions to the GWCCA about disadvantaged business participation in the stadium project. In a detailed response, the authority\u2019s chief operating officer said that records on that information did not exist.\n\nBut the details are almost sure to be outlined in the final contract before any work is done, said Lloyd Atkins, a consultant in the minority business development office of the University of Georgia\u2019s Small Business Development Center.\n\n\"These minority and disadvantaged business participation goals are usually established early on because if not framed in the legal parameters of a contract there is no incentive to reach the goals,\" Atkins said.\n\nWith the proposed stadium\u2019s probable public-private partnership, a lot of the push for minority participation will be \"political will,\" Atkins said, with adherence to any goals set possibly monitored by the city of Atlanta\u2019s contract compliance office. (PolitiFact Georgia asked that office about any involvement in the project but received no response.)\n\nSince Fort\u2019s tweet and subsequent comments to PolitiFact Georgia, some members of the Atlanta City Council this week have lobbied for about 30 percent of the stadium work to be completed by minority contractors. Falcons executives said there will be an \"equal opportunity employment commitment\" at every stage of the project.\n\nThe GWCCA\u2019s administrative policies and procedures for procurement of supplies, equipment, goods and contractuals services states: \"It is the Authority\u2019s policy to affirmatively encourage and solicit participation with respect to purchases of goods and services by qualified business enterprises to include disadvantage business enterprise (W/MBE) Women and Minority Business Enterprise.\"\n\nAlthough the Falcons stadium term sheet is one very early step in the process, Fort said the brevity of the statement did not bode well for the participation of minority businesses in the project. \"In a state with such a sorry history of using African-American vendors, I was not comfortable with \u2018a wink-and-a-nod, trust me approach,\u2019 \" Fort said.\n\nFort pointed to last year\u2019s audit of the Georgia Department of Transportation\u2019s disadvantaged business enterprise program. That audit -- publicized during the campaign for a regional transportation sales tax -- found that the state agency had fallen below its targets for awarding contracts to minority and/or women-owned businesses that met the federal definition of disadvantaged. Between 2009 and June 2011, the Transportation Department awarded eligible firms owned by African-Americans just 2.4 percent of its contracts even though those firms make up 14.1 percent of all companies available to perform construction and engineering work. Women owned-businesses received 8.4 percent of the work, and Hispanic-owned firms received 1.1 percent.\n\nAfter the audit, the Georgia Department of Transportation increased its existing targets for awarding contracts to minority and women-owned disadvantaged firms. And Fort used the numbers as part of his campaign against the regional transportation sales tax.\n\nWhen the Georgia Dome was built in the early 1990s and opened in 1992, disadvantaged businesses accounted for 20.7 percent of the contracts, valued at $36.8 million. The total value of construction related contracts on the Dome was $177.8 million, according to information provided by the GWCCA. Removing two sole-source contracts from the available construction work increased the disadvantaged business participation to 23.6 percent.\n\nUnder the federal definition, white, male-owned businesses can qualify as disadvantaged if they meet certain criteria including personal net worth of the business owner.\n\nFort said the current term sheet that lays out nonbinding terms approved for the new stadium contains only two lines dealing with minority business participation. He uses this brief mention as a reason to be leery of the state\u2019s promise to carry out minority participation promises.\n\nA simple look at the term sheet shows that Fort\u2019s statement is correct. But the explanation doesn\u2019t stop there. Already City Council members are pushing for specific minority business participation goals, and whatever goals are set are likely to be included in the final contract before any construction work has begun. Because the details are not yet complete, it is impossible to make inferences on what the goals would be.\n\nFort\u2019s statement is \u00a0partially accurate but needs a lot additional information.\nWe rate his statement Half True.\n\n*Arthur Blank is on the board of directors of Cox Enterprises, whose media holdings include The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\n"}

According to its figures, the commission brought in some $460 million in sales, license fees and taxes for the 2010-11 fiscal year.\n\nThat\u2019s just a single year, though, so the Commission pulls in more than $900 million in a biennium -- nearly the $1 billion that the two representatives mentioned. But here\u2019s the rub: not much of that money goes back into the state budget.\n\nMore than half of what the Commission brings in goes back into agency expenditures, liquor agent compensation and inventory purchases. The rest gets split among the state, counties and cities and a couple other areas.\n\nSo, for the 2009-2011 biennium, the state general fund received just under $200 million in liquor sales revenues.\n\nWe called the representatives to see what had happened with their commentary.\n\nRep. Kennemer was immediately apologetic. \"I am embarrassed and sorry,\" he said. The $1 billion figure came from total revenues, \"unfortunately we didn't get the rest of the verbiage corrected.\"\n\nRep. Garrett offered similar reasoning. \"It's a billion-dollar business.\"\n\nIt\u2019s true that the representatives had a basis for the $1 billion figure, but to say that liquor sales account for that much of the state budget is inaccurate -- and the representatives realized that when we checked in"}

The largest estimate we could find is not even half of Trump\u2019s assertion.\nIt\u2019s entirely unclear where Trump\u2019s estimate comes from\nTrump has previously touched on the country\u2019s fiscal burden from illegal immigration. During the 2016 presidential campaign, he claimed that \"illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year.\" That was Mostly False.\nHis latest claim more than doubles the figures he claimed two years ago;\u00a0most estimates of the unauthorized population remain around 11 million.\nThe right-leaning Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) estimated in a September 2017 report that the federal, state and local costs of more than 12.5 million people in the United States illegally was around $135 billion a year. After factoring in this population\u2019s tax contributions, the group said the total economic impact of illegal immigration was around $116 billion a year (up from $113 billion in 2013).\nThe federation seeks to reduce legal and illegal immigration to the United States, and its cost estimates tend to be higher than other related studies. Its conclusions have generally been criticized for relying on inexact estimates and broad assumptions.\nAlex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, said FAIR\u2019s 2017 report was \"fatally flawed.\" It undercounted immigrants\u2019 tax revenues, inflated the number of immigrants in the country illegally, counted millions of U.S. citizens as illegally in the United States, and used a method of estimating fiscal costs \"that is rejected by all economists who work on this subject,\" he said.\nWithout precise data on the unauthorized immigrant population, researchers typically draw inferences about characteristics based on responses to surveys that don\u2019t ask about authorization status.\nWhy illegal immigration savings wouldn\u2019t cover wall\u2019s cost \"in two months\"\nTrump claimed that a $25 billion border wall would pay itself in two months, under a scenario where illegal immigration costs $250 billion a year.\n\n"}

Dan Patrick, because there are \"100,000 families who are on the wait list.\"\n\nActually, the Houston Republican gave the statistic a couple ways as he introduced legislation on that point Feb. 18, 2013, in a hearing of the Senate Education Committee, which he chairs. He first cited \"100,000 families,\" then a few minutes later said, \"155,000 students \u2026 are enrolled in charters; approximately, as I said, 101,000 are on the wait list.\" His Feb. 18, 2013, press release about the bill said nearly 100,000 parents were on charter school waiting lists.\n\nBut 100,000 sounds like a lot of anybodies -- as Patrick indicated, that\u2019s about two-thirds of charters\u2019 actual enrollment. According to the state Sunset Commission, those 155,000 charter enrollees equal about 3 percent of Texas public school students.\n\nAre the lists that long?\n\nWe didn\u2019t field a response from Patrick spokesman Logan Spence, and Texas Education Agency spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson told us the state did not keep such numbers on charter schools, which receive public dollars but are privately managed and exempt from some education laws so they can try different approaches.\n\nCulbertson referred us to the Texas Charter Schools Association, whose spokeswoman Tracy Young emailed us waiting-list counts and some background on Texas charter schools in general.\n\nYoung said that in August 2012, the association asked its members to report their waiting-list numbers, which totaled more than 101,000 students. Of about 175 charter licensees operating in Texas at the time, she said, 137 were members of the association; 67 of those responded to the survey.\n\nThose 67 charter operators accounted for 87 percent of Texas charter school students in 2012 -- 134,532 out of the total 154,278 -- according to the association.\n\nOn a chart the group sent us, the 67 operators\u2019 wait lists added up to 101,851 students.\n\nTwo operators accounted for more than half the wait-listed students: Harmony Public Schools reported 44,942 children on wait lists, and IDEA Public Schools/Idea Academy Inc. reported 12,920.\n\n15 largest waiting lists among TCSA members who responded to 2012 survey:\n\nSource: Texas Charter Schools Association\n\n\nOperators were asked to remove duplications among their own campuses, Young said. For example, if a child were on wait lists for six campuses run by a single operator, that operator would count the child only once in its total. Young said her group confirmed that at least the operators with the largest lists had filtered out such duplicative entries.\n\nBut they did not, she said, have a way to \"de-duplicate\" children who might appear on more than one operator\u2019s list. Under the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, the association could not collect students\u2019 names and addresses, Young said, and school operators did not have a system to compare such individual data with each other.\n\nStill, she said, \"We feel certain that it represents a good number of the students on waiting lists across the state.\"\n\nThe association, which formed in 2008, last year sued the state to get public dollars for charter facilities and to allow more than 215 charter licenses in Texas. Charter school operators in 2012, according to an association fact sheet, ran 506 campuses educating 154,278 students.\n\nTexas charter schools overall have grown steadily since their inception in 1995, as shown by two charts from an August 2012 study commissioned by the Texas Business and Education Coalition, which used education agency data:\n\u00a0\n\nTexas charter school enrollment, 1997-2011\n\n"}
{"label": "pants-fire", "claim": "Donald Trump \u201cIf we stopped testing right now, we'd have very few cases, if any.\u201d", "evidence": "President Donald Trump sought to downplay the numbers associated with COVID-19 in the United States \u2014 which have passed 2 million confirmed cases and are nearing 120,000 lives lost \u2014 by arguing that the soaring national count was simply the result of superior testing.\n\"If you don't test, you don't have any cases,\" Trump said at a June 15 roundtable discussion at the White House. \"If we stopped testing right now, we'd have very few cases, if any.\"\nIt\u2019s a talking point the administration is emphasizing. Vice President Mike Pence reiterated it during a phone call to Republican governors that evening, recommending they use the argument as a strategy to quiet public concern about surging case tallies in some states. It\u2019s also a variation on a tweet the president sent earlier in the day.\nWith that in mind, we wanted to dig deeper. We reached out to the White House for comment or clarification, but we never heard back. Independent researchers told us, though, that the president\u2019s remarks are not only misleading \u2014 they\u2019re also counterproductive in terms of thinking through what\u2019s needed to combat the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe big picture\nEssentially, the president is arguing that the United States is finding more cases of COVID-19 because we are testing more \u2013 and our increased testing makes it look like we have a worse epidemic than other countries do.\n\"We will show more \u2014 more cases when other countries have far more cases than we do; they just don\u2019t talk about it,\" he added.\nBut that isn\u2019t true.\nThe numbers paint a stark picture. The United States has recorded 2.1 million cases of the novel virus so far, about a quarter of the global total and more than any other country. To Trump\u2019s point, the country is testing more now than it did at the start of the outbreak \u2014 per capita, the U.S. is in the top 20% of countries when it comes to cumulative tests run.\nBut this beefed up testing is still likely undercounting. The problem is that the U.S. outbreak is worse than that of many other countries \u2013 so we need to be testing a higher percentage of our population than do others.\nA way to understand this: the number of tests necessary to identify a positive case. If it\u2019s easier to find a positive case, that suggests the virus has spread further and more testing is necessary to track the spread of COVID-19.\nFor instance, statistics from the United States and the United Kingdom are fairly similar in terms of how many coronavirus tests are done daily per million people. But those tests yield far more positive cases in the United States. That suggests the outbreak here requires more per-capita testing than does the U.K.\u2019s.\n\"We have a much bigger epidemic, so you have to test more proportionately,\" said Jennifer Kates, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\nPut another way, a larger health crisis means \u2014 even after controlling for population size \u2014 the United States will have to test more people to find out where and how the virus has spread.

We thank him for his unwavering commitment to health care for all Americans,\" Pelosi said on March 21, 2010. \"This began over a year ago under his leadership in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act where we had very significant investments in science, technology, and innovation for health care reform. It continued in the president's budget a few months later, a budget which was a statement of our national values, which allocated resources that were part of our value system and in a way that stabilized our economy, created jobs, lowered taxes for the middle class and did so and reduced the deficit and did so in a way that had pillars of investment, including education and health care reform.\"The Rubio campaign tried to make hay of the speech the following day, linking Pelosi's words to Crist in a press release. The campaign also posted a video of Pelosi's statement with the headline \"Pelosi: Road to ObamaCare began w/Crist-Obama Stimulus,\" and is now repeating the claim in the fundraising pitch.Charlie and the stimulusNo doubt about it, Crist supported, campaigned for and endorsed the federal stimulus bill.But was he instrumental in it passing?Crist campaigned for the stimulus bill with Obama in Fort Myers on Feb. 10, 2009. He made several national television appearances supporting the proposal, saying on Hardball with Chris Matthews, for instance: \"It's going to help (Floridians') children. It's going to help their traffic situation. It's going to help produce more jobs here in the Sunshine State. That's a perspective that I have to have as, in essence, the CEO of Florida. And that's why I support it.\"We also know that Crist lobbied members of Florida's congressional delegation from both parties to support the stimulus package. The Miami Herald reported that Crist lobbied Republican Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and his brother, Lincoln Diaz-Balart, along with Democratic Reps. Kathy Castor and Debbie Wasserman Schultz.But what good did all of that campaigning from a prominent national Republican do? How many votes did he affect in Congress? Was he the lynchpin?Not a whole lot. Not a whole lot. And no.The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 passed the U.S. House 244-188, without the support of one Republican (which means no Republicans from Florida). It then passed the U.S. Senate 61-37, with just three Republican votes: Maine's two Republican senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter. (Specter's now a Democrat, by the way.)If you're truly keeping score, the conference report -- the congressional action that merges the House and Senate bills -- passed the House 246-183, again without a single GOP vote, and passed the Senate 60-38 with the votes of Collins, Snowe and Specter.\nWe also checked the Congressional Record to see if members of Congress referenced Crist during floor debate on the stimulus. Crist's name was mentioned once, on Feb. 11, 2009, by Democratic U.S. Rep. Betty Sutton of Ohio. Sutton was talking about Crist's support of the stimulus and how Crist said it could save and create jobs in Florida.So there's nothing to confirm the Rubio campaign's claim that Crist was \"instrumental.\" There's no evidence that Crist's support swayed a single vote. For the Florida delegation -- like all state delegations except Maine and Pennsylvania -- it was strictly a party-line vote. Indeed, Crist was more outlier than influencer, a rare Republican leader who spoke up but was roundly criticized in his party.\nBrendan Daly, a Pelosi spokesman, said that because no House Republicans supported the bill, that he \"does not think Crist was instrumental in passing it.\"\nWe asked Kate Kelly, a spokesman for Specter, if Crist's support had been a key factor for the Pennsylvania senator. She replied, \"Sen. Specter has never mentioned that as a reason he voted for the stimulus.\"\nCharlie begat stimulus; stimulus begat health careNow, to the Rubio campaign's claim that the stimulus bill led to health care reform.The stimulus act passed in February 2009 did have health care-related proposals, including a plan to create electronic health care records and about $20 billion to help unemployed workers purchase health care through the employer-based COBRA system. But the stimulus hardly was the impetus for health care reform. And if you read Pelosi's statement again, that's not what she was saying.She was praising Obama and citing some of his accomplishments and notable proposals that included health care. But there's scant evidence of a causal link between the stimulus and health care reform that the Rubio campaign alleges.\n\n"}

Why was the FBI told to leave the office of the Democratic National Committee? I've been wondering that, I've been asking that for months and months and I've been tweeting it out and calling it out on social media. Where is the server?

But I really do want to see the server.\"\nMoments later, Trump added, \"What happened to the servers of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the DNC? Where are those servers?

And as\u00a0for the \"Pakistani gentleman,\" Trump is referring to a House IT staffer who did not work for the DNC and who government investigators concluded did not steal or leak computer data.\nThe DNC server\nOn July 13, the Justice Department charged 12 Russian intelligence officers with hacking the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and Hillary Clinton campaign staffers.\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s indictment confirms previous findings from the U.S. intelligence community. In April 2016, Russian intelligence officials installed spying software on the computer network of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which works to elect members of the U.S. House of Representatives. The hack in turn allowed them access to 33 Democratic National Committee computers. The emails obtained through the hack were pushed out on social media beginning in June 2016, and Wikileaks soon joined that effort.\nAt some point, the FBI and DNC started working together to fight the hack and investigate how it happened, but\u00a0DNC was slow to react to the FBI\u2019s initial warning that their server had been compromised.\nDuring former FBI director James Comey\u2019s testimony to the House Intelligence Committee, Comey was asked whether the FBI\u00a0had ever received the DNC\u2019s hacked hardware.\nHe said they did not, but\u00a0obtained access from a review of the system performed by CrowdStrike, a third-party cybersecurity firm.\n\"We got the forensics from the pros that they hired which -- again, best practice is always to get access to the machines themselves, but this, my folks tell me, was an appropriate substitute,\" Comey said.\nDNC spokeswoman Adrienne Watson told PolitiFact that the DNC cooperated with the FBI\u2019s requests, which resulted in the DNC providing a copy of their server.\n\"An image of a server is the best thing to use in an investigation so that your exploration of the server does not change the evidence (just like you don\u2019t want investigators leaving their own DNA around a physical crime scene) and so that the bad actors cannot make changes to the evidence while you are looking at it,\" Watson said. \"Any suggestion that they were denied access to what they wanted for their investigation is completely incorrect.\"\n\n"}
{"label": "pants-fire", "claim": "Workers' Voice Says Josh Mandel bet against Ohio families", "evidence": "It is time for some basic finance: When interest rates rise, Treasury bond prices fall.\n\nWe could go on (buy low, sell high, etc.) but there is only one more financial fact you really need to know for purposes of understanding a new ad attacking Ohio Treasurer and U.S. Senate candidate Josh Mandel. That fact is that at some point during 2011, a trust that invests for the benefit of his wife, Ilana Shafran Mandel, held shares in an exchange traded fund that deals in Treasury bonds.\n\nThat investment now is being used by a group called Workers\u2019 Voice, affiliated with the AFL-CIO, to claim that Josh Mandel was \"betting against Ohio families.\" To understand the attack, you must understand the investment.\n\nThis fund, or ETF, is not a traditional ETF (a fund that in many ways is similar to a mutual fund) that buys and sells stocks and bonds and performs with the ups and downs of the market. Rather, this ETF, called ProShares Ultra 20+ Year Treasury, deals in long-term Treasury bonds in a manner that acts as a hedge against falling Treasury bond prices. It is a \"short\" fund, in financial parlance, and it performs inversely to the regular market for Treasuries. When prices on Treasuries fall, the value of this ETF goes up.\n\nYou could say that it bets on falling Treasury prices. Put another way, it is betting on rising interest rates. But if you wanted to criticize a politician, you might say, as Workers\u2019 Voice did in an ad appearing on cleveland.com (the website affiliated with The Plain Dealer) and other newspaper websites, that this ETF was betting on a government default. After all, if the government couldn\u2019t pay its bills, the value of its bonds would dive and this ETF could soar.\n\nThat, however, is an extreme and hypothetical example.\n\nWorkers\u2019 Voice didn\u2019t put it exactly that way, but it made clear that is what it meant. Its ad said that \"The more your family struggles, the more money Josh Mandel stands to make.\" Its rationale, explained in a link it provided for readers, was that by investing in this ETF, Mandel, through his wife, was betting on the government defaulting on its obligations.\n\nThe ad\u2019s sponsor suggested that this was especially egregious because Mandel wasn\u2019t just any investor but was, rather, a potential driver on the road to default. Although it is not known precisely when Mandel\u2019s wife bought or, perhaps, sold this ETF, it is known that in August 2011, Mandel stated that he opposed a congressional bill (which passed) to raise the government\u2019s debt limit. A higher debt limit was necessary to borrow more money and keep the government operating. Without it, the government might have defaulted on some obligations, likely devaluing formerly iron-clad government investments such as Treasury bonds. In a default, the government might stop providing some services to Ohio families.\n\nPut these together and you get a portrait of a candidate who, if elected to the Senate, would let the potential of a personal windfall stand in the way of doing the right thing for the country, or so the ad implies strongly.\n\nThat\u2019s a powerful claim, so PolitiFact Ohio asked AFL-CIO/Workers\u2019 Voice spokesman Michael Gillis for its basis. Gillis pointed us to an article, which is also linked prominently in the Ohio ad, that appears on the website of Think Progress, an arm of the liberal Center for American Progress Action Fund. The web article, dated July 27, 2012, was headlined, \"Exclusive: GOP Senate Nominee Shorting U.S. Treasury Bonds, Would Profit from Default.\"\n\nThe article noted that a trust that invests for the benefit of Ilana Mandel, called the JMS Trust, owned shares in this ProShares short ETF during 2011. According to a financial disclosure form filed by Josh Mandel last November and cited by Think Progress, the JMS Trust owned between $1,001 and $15,000 of this fund. On a different page, the financial disclosure form listed what appeared to be an additional investment in this ETF, also held by the trust, worth less than $1,001.\n\nThe Think Progress article stated, \"If a default were to occur, the desirability of Treasury bills would plummet and Mandel\u2019s ETF would skyrocket in value. That precise scenario could become more likely if Mandel wins his race against Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH). One of the top issues Mandel lists on his website is to \u2018Stop increasing the debt ceiling.\u2019 Similarly, when Congress was embroiled in the debt ceiling fight last year, he stated that he \u2018would have voted against the debt deal\u2019 that narrowly staved off a default.\"\n\nAt least in theory, this single part of the claim -- that Treasury bills would be less desirable and the ETF\u2019s value would rise if the government defaulted -- is accurate.\n\nYet that scenario is unlikely, and it oversimplifies the reason people invest in this ETF.\n\nConsider that the government has never defaulted. Yet people keep investing in this ETF, according to financial websites including Morningstar and Bloomberg, and did so even when default wasn\u2019t in the public vocabulary. In fact, it appears to PolitiFact Ohio, based on a more recent financial disclosure filed by Josh Mandel in May 2012, that Ilana Mandel\u2019s trust bought even more shares of this ETF -- up to an additional $15,000 worth -- even after the threat of default passed.\n\nProShares declined to comment to PolitiFact Ohio, but it makes clear that this ETF is not an investment for amateurs. Investment advisers and active investors buy its shares as a hedge against changes in interest rates, a gamble referred to in columns and blogs that cover high-stakes finance. ProShares recommends in its marketing and disclosure materials that investors watch this fund daily, as it is subject to volatility. It is not a casual buy-and-hold investment.\n\nIlana Mandel is not a professional investor. According to Josh Mandel\u2019s financial disclosure and his campaign spokeswoman, Nicole Sizemore, the ETF and other investments are owned through the JMS Trust. When those trust assets are put together with her husband\u2019s far more meager holdings, the couple\u2019s worth runs in a range between $1.95 million and $7.1 million, according to financial disclosure filings. Ilana Mandel inherited the money; her grandmother was a founder of Forest City Enterprises, the real estate and development company. \u00a0\n\n\"Neither Josh nor his wife have control over Ilana's family's trust so neither of them are making any investment activity decisions on it,\" Sizemore said. \"These decisions are made by the investment manager and presumably the trustees who oversee her family's trust.\"\n\nJosh Mandel has steadfastly refused to discuss his wife\u2019s holdings, other than to report what is required by disclosure rules for public officials and candidates. His campaign said it was unable to discern why the investment manager or trustees bought this particular ETF but reiterated that neither Josh nor Ilana Mandel had a role in it.\n\nAs noted in a number of financial blogs and columns, other investors buy shares in this ETF as a hedge against rising interest rates. Not being investment professionals, however, PolitiFact Ohio turned to Jack Bao, an assistant professor of finance at Ohio State University and an authority on bonds.\n\n\"I guess that if the government did default, the short ETF would rise in value,\" Bao said when we told him of the Workers\u2019 Voice scenario. But that is extremely unlikely, he said, adding that other options might have been possible to avoid default, such as printing more money, even if Congress had not raised the debt ceiling.\n\n\"To believe that somebody was buying $15,000 worth of a short ETF and betting on the government defaulting seems a little far-fetched to me,\" Bao said. What happens in most cases, he said, is the investor buys this ETF as a bet on interest rates. He or she thinks they\u2019ll go up and the value of Treasuries will go down -- but not necessarily tank.\n\nBefore we rule on the Workers\u2019\u2019 Voice claim, it\u2019s important to point out that Mandel never said he wanted the government to default. Like a number of other Republicans, he said that government spending needed to come down before Congress raised the debt ceiling. By playing this game of chicken, some Republicans said they hoped to force a more frugal solution that fell short of default. Democrats cobbled together a big enough coalition to raise the debt limit anyway. Ohio GOP Sen. Rob Portman joined them. The storm blew over.\n\nThat leaves us with an extreme claim -- that Mandel was betting against Ohio families and hoping to fatten his family wallet. While we cannot say why his wife\u2019s trust chose that particular ETF, we know that investors have plenty of rationales besides betting on default. In fact, Bao, the OSU professor, disclosed that he too invested in a short Treasury ETF. We realized that he and Ilana Mandel\u2019s investment adviser had chosen, in fact, the very same ProShares ETF.\n\nSo an OSU finance professor was betting on default, too?\n\n\" I wasn\u2019t betting on the government defaulting,\" Boa said. \"I was betting on interest rates going up.\"\n\nIn all the world\u2019s possibilities, default was one. In probabilities, it was not. As we noted, the JMS Trust appeared to buy additional shares of this ETF subsequent to last August\u2019s debt-ceiling showdown. That\u2019s an additional factor that makes the ad\u2019s claim -- that Mandel was betting against Ohio families -- far-fetched. The claim relies on one extreme possibility -- a possibility that has never occurred -- and runs with it, ignoring the other reasons why a trust fund or even a finance professor might choose this investment. That\u2019s just ridiculous. Pants on Fire!\n\n"}

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Mitt Romney Massachusetts has \"less than 1 percent of our kids that are uninsured. You (Gov. Perry) have a million kids uninsured in Texas.\"", "evidence": "During the Oct. 11, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Hanover, N.H., former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney sought to contrast health care in his state with that in rival Gov. Rick Perry's home state, Texas.\n\n\"We (Massachusetts) have less than 1 percent of our kids that are uninsured,\" Romney told Perry. \"You have a million kids uninsured in Texas. A million kids.\" Under the administration of George W. Bush, he continued, \"the percentage uninsured went down. Under your leadership, it's gone up.\"\n\nWe weren\u2019t sure whether Romney meant the uninsurance rate for Texans of all ages, or specifically for children. Romney didn\u2019t explicitly cite children in his comment, and when we contacted the campaign, they confirmed that he had meant uninsured Texans overall. However, the comment followed on the heels of discussion of uninsured children, so we think viewers would have reason to think Romney was talking about the uninsurance rate for kids only.\n\nAs it turns out, which meaning is ascribed to Romney\u2019s words pretty much determines whether Romney is right or wrong.\n\nTo explain, we\u2019ll turn to historical data compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau. First, let\u2019s look at the uninsurance rate for the population as a whole.\n\nUnder Bush, the percentage of Texans without health insurance declined from 24.5 percent in 1995 to 23.5 percent in 2001.\n\nUnder Perry, the percentage without health insurance rose from 23.2 percent in 2001 to 26.1 percent in 2009, the most recent year available.\n\n(Eagle-eyed readers will notice that the rate for 2001 was slightly different for the two governors. This is because the Census Bureau changed its methodology in the interim.)\n\nSo, based on the uninsurance rates for Texas\u2019 population at large, Romney\u2019s claim is justified. How about the rates for children? That\u2019s a different story.\n\nUnder Bush, the uninsurance rate for children fell from 22.4 percent in 1995 to 21.3 percent in 2001.\n\nUnder Perry, the uninsurance rate for children didn\u2019t rise -- it continued to fall, from 21.1 percent in 2001 to 16.5 percent in 2009.\n\nSo looking at the children\u2019s uninsurance rate, Romney\u2019s comment is wrong.\n\n\"The continued decline in the number of uninsured Texas children \u2026 is the silver lining to a very cloudy uninsured rate for Texas adults,\" said a report from the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank in Austin.\n\nThe results for children\u2019s uninsurance surprised us. Even as uninsurance rates for the Texas population as a whole were rising, the rates for children were falling -- and falling faster than the overall rates rose. In addition, the rate of children without insurance in Texas fell faster than the national rate, which declined from 11.3 percent in 2001 to 10 percent in 2009. And this all came as Texas\u2019 population was increasing by about 20 percent, meaning that huge numbers of kids had to be added to the insurance rolls just to keep pace with population growth.\n\nOne explanation we looked at is the margin of error for the Census Bureau studies. Using the sampling error values included in the tables, we found that the declines for both all Texans and children during the Bush years was within the margin of error. That means that the decreases we saw might actually have been an increase -- the measurements weren\u2019t precise enough to know for sure.\n\nHowever, the changes under Perry were all outside the margin of error. So sampling error didn\u2019t cause an anomaly with Perry\u2019s statistics.\n\nAs it turns out, the biggest increase in childrens\u2019 coverage under Perry came from government programs, mostly Medicaid, which is a joint federal-state program. In 2001, 22.5 percent of children received their health care from Medicaid; by 2009, that rose to 37.4 percent. During that same period, the percentage covered by private health insurance fell from 59 percent to 48.5 percent.\n\nBoth Bush and Perry acted to increase coverage of Texas children by Medicaid and other government programs, though both of them also took actions that worked against or delayed increasing coverage.\n\nIn 1997, when Bush was governor, the Texas Legislature established the Texas Healthy Kids Corp., a public-private partnership that subsidized coverage for children in families with incomes up to 185 percent of the federal poverty line.\n\nThat same year, Congress passed the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, which gives federal matching funds for states to help low-income children get health coverage. By 1999, after initially being criticized for slow adoption of SCHIP, Bush and the Legislature sped up Texas\u2019 utilization of the program.\n\n\"Texas was slow in enacting and implementing SCHIP expansions, in part because the Legislature meets only every other year, and the federal authorizing statute was enacted after adjournment in 1997,\" wrote Joshua M. Wiener and Niall Brennan in a 2002 paper for the Urban Institute, an independent Washington think tank. \"After implementation, however, enrollment in the Texas SCHIP program increased quickly. In June 2000, enrollment was only 39,859 beneficiaries, but by September 2001, it had reached 439,222 children.\"\n\nBush also signed Medicaid eligibility simplification provisions for children, which helped increase coverage rates.\n\nPerry, for his part, first tried to privatize many of the administrative functions of his health and human services department, a decision that led to backlogs and hampered signups for Medicaid, said Anne Dunkelberg, associate director of the Center for Public Policy Priorities.\n\nLater, Perry pulled back and instead appointed Tom Suehs to head the department. Under Suehs, Dunkelberg said, the department has \"really turned things around,\" possibly explaining the past few years of insurance coverage gains among children, she said.\n\nSo both governors did some things that boosted coverage (and some things that didn\u2019t) but their powers were hardly dictatorial. To the extent that Texas has seen gains in coverage among children, significant credit goes to the federally supported programs of Medicaid and SCHIP. And numerous other factors, including the general state of the economy, have an impact on insurance coverage rates.\n\nOur ruling\n\nRomney\u2019s camp said he meant to refer to the uninsured population as a whole, and using those statistics, he\u2019s right that uninsurance rates declined under Bush (though within the statistics\u2019 margin of error) and rose under Perry.\n\nBut we think many viewers, seeing the comment in context, might have assumed that Romney was referring to uninsurance among children. And for children, uninsurance has actually declined steeply under Perry.\n\nMeanwhile, the policies pursued by both Bush and Perry had an influence on their respective trendlines, but their records in this regard were somewhat mixed and other factors also contributed"}

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Jimmy Carter \"When I ran against incumbent President Gerald Ford, you know how much money we raised? None.\"", "evidence": "During a recent interview with CNN\u2019s Piers Morgan, former President Jimmy Carter made a striking claim about how presidential campaigns had changed since Carter first ran against President Gerald Ford in 1976.\n\nAsked by Morgan about the challenges facing President Barack Obama, Carter said in the Feb. 21, 2013, interview that the presidency has \"changed dramatically. As a matter of fact, when I ran against incumbent President Gerald Ford, you know how much money we raised? None.\"\n\nComing off a 2012 election in which Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney together raised in excess of $2 billion, that\u2019s quite a difference. Is it correct?\n\nWe checked with campaign-finance experts, who explained how campaign finance was structured in 1976.\n\nThat was the first presidential election run under the post-Watergate amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act. Under this law, presidential candidates were able to receive a partial federal match for money they raised for the primary, up to $5 million. For the general election, candidates could receive full federal funding, up to $20 million, as long as they raised no private money for the general election and stuck to expenditure limits.\n\nWe were able to obtain original campaign-finance documentation during a visit to the public records room of the Federal Election Commission in Washington, D.C.\n\nDuring the primary phase of the campaign, Carter raised $13.8 million. Of that, $3.5 million came from federal matching funds, and the remainder was raised privately. But since Carter wasn\u2019t running against Ford at that point -- but rather such Democratic rivals as California Gov. Jerry Brown and the late Idaho Sen. Frank Church -- we don\u2019t think these fundraising efforts undercut Carter\u2019s claim of not raising money against Ford. (Interestingly, some of Carter\u2019s biggest fundraising draws during the primaries were concerts by such Southern rock bands as the Allman Brothers Band, Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Marshall Tucker Band.)\n\nWhat happened in the general election is the more relevant issue for judging the claim Carter made on CNN. Both he and Ford agreed to the expenditure limits, meaning they qualified for the $20 million in federal funds. By accepting the money, both candidates were legally barred from raising money for their official campaign committee.\n\nOn the surface, this supports Carter\u2019s claim. \"No presidential candidate raised a dime for a general election campaign between Watergate and Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign,\" said Kenneth A. Gross, who practices political and election law for the firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP. \"Until 2008, every major-party general-election candidate was 100 percent publicly funded.\"\n\nBut as is so often the case with campaign finance, there were some exceptions that make Carter\u2019s claim an oversimplification. We learned about at least three ways in which Carter (or his ticket-mate, Walter Mondale, or other surrogates such as his wife Rosalynn) were allowed to raise money for the general election. The key is that this money had to go toward groups other than his own official presidential campaign committee.\n\n\u2022 Fundraising for the Democratic National Committee and other party committees. The DNC, like its Republican equivalent, was allowed under the law to raise and spend $3 million on behalf of the Carter-Mondale ticket for the general election campaign.\n\nNews reports in October 1976 suggested tension between the Carter campaign and DNC chairman Robert Strauss due to the DNC\u2019s inability to deliver all of the permitted $3 million to the presidential ticket.\n\nStill, while not every fundraising effort for the DNC was headlined by Carter, \"we did raise money for the DNC up to the limit,\" said Peter G. Bourne, who served as Carter\u2019s deputy campaign director in the general election as well as mid-Atlantic director and director of the Washington office during the primaries.\n\n\u2022 Fundraising for an authorized \"compliance fund.\" The law allowed the Carter campaign to collect money for a separate account called a \"compliance fund,\" which supported the campaign\u2019s legal efforts to follow campaign finance laws. FEC data shows that the compliance fund collected more than $58,000 for the general election.\n\n\u2022 Fundraising for down-ballot candidates. Bourne said the Carter campaign, and sometimes Carter himself, also raised money for House, Senate and other candidates. Media coverage backs this up. The New York Times reported that Carter himself attended, among other events, a rally in Norfolk, Va., in September; a fundraiser for Tennessee Democratic Senate candidate Jim Sasser; and a box-lunch fundraiser at the Hartford Civic Center in October.\n\nIn addition, in October, Mondale attended a fundraiser at the home of former Rep. Ogden R. Reid, D-N.Y., and a fundraising dinner in Essex County, N.J. And Rosalynn Carter narrated Aaron Copland's \"A Lincoln Portrait\" at an October fundraiser at Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C., in a joint appearance with Leonard Bernstein. She also appeared at a fundraising event for New York State Democrats in New York City\u2019s Tavern on the Green.\n\nOur ruling\n\nCarter said on CNN that when he ran against Ford in 1976, \"you know how much money we raised? None.\"\n\nCarter is correct that, like every presidential candidate until Obama in 2008, he did not raise money for his own campaign committee for the general election, opting instead for federal funding that came with some strings. However, he exaggerates slightly by suggesting that he and his campaign raised no money during their general-election campaign against Ford. In fact, they did help raise money for the DNC, a compliance fund and for down-ballot candidates"}

It allowed rates to rise on incomes above $450,000 for married couples.\n\nBut during the negotiating, Boehner balked at increasing the maximum 35 percent tax rate on high-income taxpayers at all because of the effects for small business.\n\n\"The problem with raising tax rates on the wealthiest Americans is that more than half of them are small business owners,\" Boehner said in a news conference. \"Raising tax rates will slow down our ability to create the jobs that everyone says they want.\"\n\nPolitiFact has examined a similar claim Boehner made about small business owners before, and rated it False. FactCheck.org also has looked at the issue, calling it \"an incorrect talking point\" and a \"bogus claim.\" But we wondered about current figures behind the claim, and several readers asked about its accuracy.\n\nWe asked Boehner's office how he backed up the statement. His staff said the tax increases would hit half of all small business income, and they pointed us to a January 2012 report from the President\u2019s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness.\n\nThe council's report states: \"About half of business income now accrues to pass-through entities such as S corporations and partnerships; although the income of such pass-through entities is subject to tax at the individual level, it is excluded from the corporate tax.\"\n\nIn other words, Boehner's staff said, many small businesses file their taxes as individuals, not corporations, and 53 percent of all business income is taxed through the individual code.\n\nBoehner's staff also cited a report by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation in Congress which said the tax hikes would affect roughly 940,000 small business owners. It, too, found that 53 percent of business income would be reported on tax returns in the top brackets on which Obama would raise taxes.\n\nThat does show that some small business owners would see taxes go up. But it falls short of supporting Boehner's statement.\n\nWhile the JCT report found that 53 percent of business income would be reported in the top two tax brackets, that is not at all the same as saying that half of the earners are being taxed at that rate.\n\nIn fact, the JCT estimated that just 3.5 percent of taxpayers with business income in 2013 would fall in the tax brackets that would rise under Obama's proposal.\n\nAnd the JCT said its figures \"do not imply that all of the income is from entities that might be considered 'small.' For example, in 2005, 12,862 S corporations and 6,658 partnerships had receipts of more than $50 million.\"\n\nS corporations and partnerships are \"pass-through\" businesses in which profits pass from the business to individual shareholders for tax purposes. They include sole proprietorships and such partnerships as big law firms and financial funds. Goldman Sachs was classified as a partnership before it went public in 1999.\n\nSo what is a small business?\n\nThe Office of Tax Analysis at the U.S. Treasury Department issued a study in 2011 that recognized the need for a clear definition. The authors acknowledge that defining a small business is a matter of setting some subjective parameters.\n\nThe ones they set include a limit of $10 million in income or deductions to be counted as \"small,\" and a minimum labor deduction of $10,000 to distinguish businesses that don\u2019t have any employees.\n\nOther tests they applied excluded businesses on the very low end of the scale, such as those with $4,600 or less net annual income. They defined an \"owner\" as someone who gets at least one-fourth of income from a small business.\n\nNot surprisingly, by narrowing the definition, far fewer tax filers qualified as small businesses.\nThe analysis found that:\n\n"}

The bills sought to compel cities to honor ICE detainer requests on local law enforcement agencies by withholding federal grants. They gave local authorities legal immunity to do so.\nThe idea behind limiting cooperation between local and federal authorities is to encourage crime reporting and witnesses from the immigrant community to come forward, according to Hiroshi Motomura, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.

For some reason, when the law was written, the president was exempt.\"\nGiuliani has the law pretty much right. Trump, as president, has no legal obligation to detach himself from his businesses and financial interests.\nThe law at issue is Title 18 Section 208 of the U.S. code. It says federal executive branch employees can\u2019t participate in government matters in which they or their immediate family has a financial interest.\nBecause of this law, some federal employees put their investments in a blind trust. This allows them to sidestep the regulation and participate in a matter that might otherwise pose a conflict of interest.\nBut the president and the vice president, despite being executive branch employees, are exempt. According to the law\u2019s definitions, Title 18 Section 208 does not apply to them, nor does it apply to members of Congress or federal judges.\n\"It appears that presidents have mostly escaped the normal web of ethics and conflict-of-interest laws,\" said Scott Amey, general counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government accountability watchdog.\nAmey added that presidents are allowed to accept gifts in many cases, too.\nIt\u2019s been this way since at least 1974, when the Justice Department issued a letter saying Title 18 Section 208 did not apply to the president. Congress expressly codified the exemptions in 1989.\nIn the 1974 letter, the Justice Department said the legislative history of this conflict-of-interest provision indicated that it was never intended to apply to the president.

Job growth is near the bottom. Georgia has more bank failures than any state.\n\nBut a state senator from Cobb County offered up a statistic earlier this month that added a different dimension to the economic troubles.\n\n\"Every 1 percent increase in the cost of health insurance today causes about 30,000 Georgians to be uninsured,\" said Sen. Judson Hill, a Republican from Marietta.\n\nHill said this during a Georgia Senate debate of a bill he wanted passed. Senate Bill 471 is aimed at authorizing the state\u2019s Insurance Department to work with other states to create a more competitive health insurance market that will result in lower costs for customers. The Republican-led Senate passed the bill by a 2-1 ratio. The Georgia House of Representatives has not yet voted on the bill.\n\nHill told us that the state loses millions of dollars a year when it has to pay for medical costs of uninsured Georgians who use emergency rooms as their first source of primary medical care.\n\n\"[The state is] saving a lot of money by helping the uninsured get health insurance,\" the senator said.\n\nStill, PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether Hill was right about this claim. Do 30,000 Georgians lose their health insurance when there is a 1 percent increase in cost?\n\nHill said the numbers came from a study he read several years ago. Hill offered some more details through a Senate spokeswoman. The senator pointed to a few national statistics on how many Americans lose their health insurance and estimated what the numbers would be in Georgia.\n\nHealth insurance cost experts believe there is a correlation between rising insurance costs and more people losing their insurance. Rising health insurance premiums are generally a result of increased quantity and quality of medical services, some researchers have found. The numbers of how many lose their insurance when costs rise 1 percent varies from the studies we\u2019ve seen and Hill sent us. Some of these estimates are based on data that\u2019s in some cases more than a decade old.\n\nIn 2005, a Harvard University professor, a University of Michigan professor and a researcher from the National Bureau of Economic Research produced a study that examined the increase in health insurance costs and the decrease of those insured in the 1990s.\n\n\"Our estimates suggest that a 1 percent premium increase results in a net increase in uninsured of 164,000 people. This compares with an estimate by the Lewin Group of 300,000 individuals losing employment-based coverage because of a 1 percent premium increase,\" the study found.\n\nWe did not hear back from any of the researchers. The Lewin Group, through a spokesman, declined to comment.\n\nGeorgia has 3.15 percent of the nation\u2019s population, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. Using the study\u2019s estimate, that would mean 5,166 Georgians would lose their health insurance, a far cry from Hill\u2019s statement. Using the Lewin Group\u2019s estimate, the number of Georgians losing their insurance would be 9,450, which is slightly closer to the senator\u2019s statement.\n\nHill argued the numbers are higher.\n\n\"The upper side of that number is approximately 500,000; Georgia represents about 3-4 percent of that number because Georgia has a high number of insured lives,\" Hill wrote in an email.\n\nThe highest national estimate Hill sent us was 400,000. The senator mentioned the Lewin Group study, a Congressional Budget Office study that put the number at 200,000 people who lose health insurance for every 1 percent increase in cost and another group that estimated between 200,000 and 400,000 people lose their insurance.\n\nHill told us in a telephone interview that he had heard estimates of 28,000 Georgians who lose their insurance each time costs rise by a percentage point. He rounded the estimate to 30,000 in his comments to the Senate but conceded the estimate may be lower.\n\n\"My real purpose is to do everything we can to make sure health insurance is more affordable,\" the senator said.\n\nIn 2010, nearly one in five Georgians lacked health insurance, according to an annual report by Georgia State University researchers, who compile an annual study on the topic based on U.S. census data. In 2008, the year the Great Recession\u2019s footprints could be seen throughout Georgia, 18 percent of Georgians were uninsured, the GSU researchers found.\n\nGeorgia State associate professor Bill Custer talked about the recession\u2019s impact with PolitiFact Georgia. He said there\u2019s been a rapid increase in the number of Georgians uninsured because incomes have fallen.\n\n\"It\u2019s difficult to give a magnitude on that relationship,\" Custer said when asked whether Hill\u2019s numbers are correct. \"If someone put a gun to my head, I\u2019d say he\u2019s pretty close. But thankfully, no one has done that.\"\n\nEven if we use the highest national estimate of the number of people who lose their insurance if costs increase by 1 percent, 500,000, the number of Georgians who would lose their insurance would be 15,000. That\u2019s based on 3 percent of Americans living in Georgia. Considering the recession\u2019s impact in Georgia and that a larger percentage of Georgians were uninsured between 2008 and 2010, maybe the total is higher.\n\nCuster, the Georgia State expert, believes Hill is close with his estimate.

A toy helicopter looks like it's floating above.\nAs a Texas House member, the Stephenville Republican carried into law a 2011 measure enabling hunters to shoot at feral hogs or coyotes from helicopters, provided the landowner or his agent has given permission. \"It became law,\" Miller told Austin American-Statesman columnist Ken Herman during an office tour in June 2016, \"and we have 130 new businesses across Texas doing helicopter hog hunts. Took a liability and turned it into an asset. It\u2019s been great. It\u2019s been eradicating hogs ever since.\"\n\"Eradicating\" means killing, which is how hunters including trappers and ranchers attack some of the estimated 1.5 million-plus feral hogs in Texas whose sows typically produce an annual litter of four to six offspring, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department says.\n\"There seem to be very few inhibiting factors to curtail this population growth,\" the agency says on a feral hogs web page that lists various ways people can try to reduce the population. Among the options: \"In some areas of Texas, aerial gunning from a helicopter is an efficient technique.\"\nBut are there really 130 new businesses devoted to helicopter hog hunts?\nA couple of providers of the in-the-sky Texas hunts each told us that seems unlikely; more on that ahead.\nWhen we asked about Miller\u2019s figure, an agriculture department spokesman, Mark Loeffler, advised by email that the commissioner\u2019s \"130,\" offered in passing, Loeffler stressed, was based on his recollection of a TPWD statistic \"for the number of companies permitted to do these aerial takes.\"\nAt the parks department, spokesman Tom Harvey told us there\u2019s no way for the agency to pin down from the paperwork how many hog-hunting operations sprung up after the law came to be. But 140 Aerial Wildlife Management Permits were active/valid when we inquired in July 2016, including, Harvey said by email, 104 permits whose recipients had indicated a commercial purpose--which we took to include businesses offering helicopter hog hunts.\nCompared with 2010, the year before Miller won approval of his change in law, the count of 104 permit-holders indicating a commercial purpose was up from 86 applicants indicating a commercial purpose, according to the parks department.\nGenerally, Harvey said, aerial hog hunts have helped control feral hogs, which he called a \"rampant nuisance species.\"\nAccording\u00a0to information provided by hunters, Harvey said, about 17,000 feral hogs were taken from the air in 2010. In contrast, 22,533 were removed in 2011 with more than that taken each year through 2015--on average 27,500 a year. Harvey added that hogs shot from the air account for a fairly small percentage of the estimated 750,000-plus feral hogs annually harvested statewide; the latter figure is a state estimate of the number of feral hogs harvested in 2010.\n\n"}

They would remain under DeKalb County\u2019s schools.\nThe Atlanta expansion in Druid Hills was largely fueled by residents there who wanted to join the city\u2019s schools after DeKalb school leaders rejected the idea of a charter cluster to give them control over several schools.\nDecatur\u2019s annexation plan, meanwhile, was designed, in part, to accommodate a school system already growing at an unprecedented rate.\nA joint letter from the city and school district in November, was blunt: Student enrollment would grow by about 550 students by 2020, even without annexation, based on low-growth projections.\nAn annexation before a new city was adjacent to Decatur\u2019s borders would allow the city to add to its tax base, and find land for new school facilities that would be needed, the letter said.\nThe school board reluctantly signed off on annexation plans in December, with the conditions that a new school site be identified for Decatur, a densely populated city with about 20,400 residents in just 4.6-square miles.\nAnother condition called for current and future city leaders to be \"cautious\" about rezoning commercial areas into residential zones.\nThose caveats suggest worry about overcrowding through annexation is a concern even to district leaders.\nBut the enrollment numbers don\u2019t bear those worries out.\nDistrict spokeswoman Courtney Burnett provided us with a 10-year history of system enrollment.\n\n"}

The proposed changes in House Bill 194 include allowing voters to change their address online, requiring people casting provisional ballot to provide additional forms of identity, eliminating the requirement that poll workers direct voters in the wrong precinct to the correct one and prohibiting elections boards from mailing absentee ballots to voters.\n\nAmong the controversial changes are new limits on early voting, which Democrats say amount to voter suppression. Republicans say the state needs more uniform voting regulations and less costly ways to manage elections.\n\nUnder the bill, voting by mail is cut to 21 days before an election, from 35 now. And in-person voting would be restricted to 10 days before an election.\n\nThis last point was one of several Democratic House Leader Armond Budish of Beachwood, railed against in a news release on May 18, the day the bill passed along party lines.\n\n\"Changes in House Bill 194 that make it more difficult to participate in Ohio elections include reducing in-person early voting from 35 days to 6,\" he said.\n\nPolitiFact Ohio wondered how Budish came up with six days, given that the bill says 10 days.\n\nSpecifically the House Bill 194 reads: \"For all voters who are applying to vote absent voter\u2019s ballots in person, ballots shall be printed and ready for use beginning on the tenth day before the day of the election.\"\n\nSo how does Budish come up with 6 days?\n\nHis chief of staff, Keary McCarthy, said pay close attention to the bill\u2019s language.\n\nThe bill goes on to say that in-person voting is prohibited on Sundays and must end the Friday before Election Day. Applying these restrictions to the 10 day-period, four days become off limits to voters: The first and last Sunday in the period and the Saturday and Monday immediately preceding Election Day.\n\nThe Ohio Senate, also controlled by Republicans, passed Senate Bill 148 that also makes significant changes to the election laws and processes. It mirrors the House Bill in many ways but offers some differences, which will be worked out in coming days among Republican leaders representing both chambers.\n\nOne of the differences between the two bills concerns in-person voting. The Senate\u2019s version calls for in-person voting to begin 16 days before Election Day. But this window is also squeezed by prohibiting voting on Sundays and on the Saturday and Monday before Election Day. It also requires elections boards to close Saturday voting at noon.

Thompson said yes.\n\nMercure then asked: \"What do you say to those critics that say that you're not?\"\n\nCue the riff.\n\n\"Ninety-one times I cut taxes; 91 times,\" Thompson replied. \"Three times, income taxes. Eliminated the inheritance taxes, eliminated the gift taxes. Gave the people of this state $2.1 billion in property tax (relief) -- and never raised taxes.

The \"burden\" measurement is considered the gold standard for measuring tax impact.\n\nBut in saying he never raised any taxes, Thompson raised the bar awfully high, so we decided to take a look.\n\nDarrin Schmitz, Thompson\u2019s campaign spokesman, told us Thompson \"was referring to Wisconsin\u2019s general taxes: income, sales, property and corporate taxes.\"\n\nBut that\u2019s an attempt to lower the bar.\n\nThompson did not qualify the statement when he made it. In fact, he listed a variety of taxes.\n\nWith a little research we found examples of taxes Thompson raised -- including some of the ones his campaign mentioned as not being raised.\n\nGeneral taxes: The 1995-1997 state budget contained $63 million in tax increases -- including boosts in the general tax increases Thompson cited, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the neutral scorekeeper that tallies tax hikes and tax cuts. The budget projected an increase of $17.5 million in sales tax revenue over the two-year period by eliminating an exemption for certain office equipment. And eliminating an exemption for certain health care providers raised corporate income taxes by a projected $900,000.\n\n(That budget also raised fees by $120 million over two years.)\n\nThe 1997-1999 budget contained $125 million in tax increases, the fiscal bureau said. That included an increase of $36 million in sales tax revenue over two years by imposing a \"use tax\" on catalog sales.\n\nCigarettes: The cigarette tax was 25 cents per pack when Thompson took office. It was raised four times during his tenure and was 59 cents when he left to join President George W. Bush\u2019s administration. (The tax is now $2.52.)\n\nGasoline: The gas tax rose to 18 cents per gallon shortly after Thompson took office, based on a law adopted before he took office, and rose by more than 8 cents to 26.4 cents before he left. (It\u2019s now 30.9 cents.)\n\nTwelve of the 14 gas-tax increases under Thompson were automatic annual adjustments, which occurred because of the previous law. But Thompson did not take action to stop the automatic increases and two of the increases -- which totaled 3 of the 8 cents -- were raised by budgets adopted during his tenure. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s not an exhaustive list, but it provides enough for the claim at hand.\n\nOur rating\n\nThompson stated flatly that as governor, he \"never raised taxes.\" Thompson has a long list of taxes he cut and, on balance, he can claim to have reduced taxes.

By one count, they spent over $400 million during the 2012 elections alone through a series of affiliated and hard-to-track\u00a0groups.\nThis Sunday, the comic strip Doonesbury took aim at brothers Charles and David. The character Kim bemoaned the impact of the Supreme Court on campaign money.\n\"You know, the Roberts court really did screw us over with Citizens United,\" she said to Mike Doonesbury, speaking about the U.S. Supreme Court and a decision that allows corporations and unions to contribute unlimited amounts of money to political campaigns. \"Last election cycle, a pair of nasty billionaires spent three times what the top 10 unions spent combined.\"\n\"You mean David and Charles Koch? The respected civic-minded job-creators?\" asked Mike.\nIt might be a comic strip, but Doonesbury certainly reaches plenty of eyeballs. And in this case, the claim is no laugher. We can fact-check whether the Koch brothers themselves spent three times as much as the top 10 unions in the last election.\nWe asked Doonesbury creator Garry Trudeau where he got his numbers, and he pointed us to a couple of articles. One from the Huffington Post tied the two men to a total of $490 million. The other from Republic Report, a liberal investigative project, found that the top 10 unions (based on their donations) accounted for $153 million. That\u2019s actually a little more than a 3 to 1 difference.\n\"I rounded it in Kochs\u2019 favor for rhetorical purposes,\" Trudeau said.\nBut the numbers aren\u2019t so simple.\nIn fact, after talking to independent experts, we could not find an apples-to-apples comparison that included all the Koch brothers\u2019 spending and all the union spending that ranges from local to federal races, and from supporting a candidate to supporting a cause. A limited comparison is possible, and we\u2019ll get to that in a bit, but when it comes to tracking Koch money, the two brothers have set up a Byzantine network of nonprofits that make it impossible to know how much of their own money they have put into the game.\nThe Koch brothers' spending\nWe can say for sure that the $490 million Trudeau cited came from more people than just Charles and David Koch. It included campaign contributions from Koch Industries political action committees and from Koch Industries employees. In fact, the article itself doesn\u2019t contend that all the money came from the Kochs. It called it part of the \"Koch network.\"\n\"I saw that claim in Doonesbury and was surprised by it,\" Lloyd Hitoshi Mayer, a University of Notre Dame Law School professor who studies political nonprofits, told us. \"Trudeau may have mistakenly overestimated the amount attributable to the Koch brothers.\"\nMayer noted that financial records show that at least $39 million spent by the Koch-affiliated group Americans for Prosperity came from donors other than the Kochs.\nThe biggest share, $407 million, came from the Koch\u2019s unusual network of nonprofits. This network has been the focus of intensive research.\nThe Washington Post\u00a0and the Center for Responsive Politics, a group that tracks money in politics, sifted through 17,000 tax records to piece together how the Koch network deploys its funds. Its signature method is to create what are called \"disregarded entities.\" These are nonprofits that totally mask the people behind them. Robert Maguire is the center\u2019s lead investigator.\n\"We haven\u2019t found a network of organizations like this anywhere else,\" Maguire said. \"The Koch brothers have mobilized this money and the amount is incomparable, even relative to other conservative funding organizations.\"\nMaguire and the nonprofit investigative journalism organization ProPublica have documented how the legal structure of this network allows the Koch brothers to exercise a great deal of control over how this money is spent. The Kochs organize regular meetings where they invite donors who share their policy goals to join with them in common purpose. Managers and lawyers with strong ties to the Kochs play a key role in running this network. But so far, the corporate veil remains impenetrable.\nThat means while the Kochs control the purse strings, the money doesn\u2019t all come out of their pocket.\n\"We have no idea how much of the money comes from the Kochs,\" Maguire said.\nThe union spending\n\n"}

You're a liar.\nWell, you're a bigger liar, you tax raiser.\n\nCrist told Fox's Chris Wallace that he signed the largest tax cut in the state's history, (a claim we twice have rated False) while Rubio proposed the largest tax increase ever in Florida (a claim we plan to rate soon). Rubio claimed that Crist broke a no new taxes pledge (he signed a 2009 budget with $2.2 billion in increased fees) while Rubio kept the same pledge (a claim we also rated False). Rubio also said Crist is distorting Rubio's tax record. That prompted a comeback from Florida's sitting governor.\n\n\"Just let me say that (Rubio) voted for tax increases when he was on the West Miami City Commission, and he said on his Web site that he has never voted for a new tax,\" Crist said. \"That's just not the truth, and he ought to be truthful to the people of Florida before he asks for their vote.\"\n\nRubio responded flatly: \"Chris, that's also inaccurate.\"\n\nBecause both candidates seem hung up on if either ever supported a tax increase, we wanted to examine Rubio's time as a West Miami City commissioner.\n\nBefore he was elected to the state House, Rubio was a member of the West Miami City Commission from 1998-2000. Records show that in 1998 and 1999, he voted to increase the city's property tax collections.\n\nUnderstanding the process can be a little tricky.\n\nCities and counties across Florida set a property tax rate. That rate, which essentially is a percentage, is then mulitplied by the value of a person's property. The result of the calculation is a person's property tax bill.\n\nWest Miami didn't raise its property tax rate in either 1998 or 1999, but because property values increased (the other half of the calculation). West Miami took in more money in 1998 and 1999, and West Miami residents paid more in property taxes.\n\nWest Miami published a \"notice of proposed tax increase\" in 1998 and 1999, according to the Palm Beach Post, and state law requires city leaders to announce the tax rate as a tax increase.\n\nPolitiFact Florida tracked down the final budget resolutions for both years. They show that the city of West Miami, without raising tax rates, was increasing property taxes -- 1.402 percent in 1998 and 5.545 percent in 1999. The roll call has then-Commissioner Rubio as voting \"Y\" both years.\n\nA Rubio spokesman, Alberto Martinez, told the Post that Rubio did not vote for tax increases because the tax rate did not change. It's an ironic argument because Rubio argued as a member of the Legislature that local governments were raising taxes while being able to claim they were keeping the tax rate the same. \"One of the reasons the system is broken is because with the massive escalation of valuations, local governments have been able to brag about cutting your millage, yet you are still paying more in property taxes,\" Rubio wrote in a 2007 letter to supporters.\n\nThat's what happened in West Miami.\n\nResponding to a claim from Crist, Rubio said it was \"inaccurate\" to say he voted to raise taxes while a member of the West Miami City Commission.

{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Bruce Rauner \"There\u2019s more union jobs growing in Texas, which is a right-to-work state, than in Illinois, and factory workers make more money in Texas than they do in Illinois.\"", "evidence": "At a recent forum on workforce participation, Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner claimed the state couldn\u2019t give away, let alone sell, a shuttered auto plant in downstate Normal \"because our regulations are so hostile to business and our taxes are so high.\"\nIn fact, Rauner\u2019s own administration last year lured a new tenant for the old Mitsubishi Motors factory, an electric car startup.\nThat misrepresentation sparked a lot of controversy, but something else the governor said at the forum also caught our attention. He claimed laid-off Mitsubishi workers, all union members, told him they were moving to Texas.\n\"There\u2019s more union jobs growing in Texas, which is a right-to-work state, than in Illinois, and factory workers make more money in Texas than they do in Illinois. That\u2019s where the opportunity is,\" Rauner said.\nRauner has long attacked union power in Illinois as an impediment to the state\u2019s economic vitality. Usually, however, he compares Illinois\u2019 job growth to neighboring Indiana, which like Texas is also a so-called right-to-work state where union membership can\u2019t be compelled.\nThat got us wondering: Is Rauner right that the job picture is brighter for union members in Texas? And why is he now pointing to the Lone Star state, with an energy-rich economy that has little in common with Illinois, instead of Indiana next door?\nApples to...grapefruits\nRauner often complains that pro-union, anti-business policies of Illinois Democrats have worked to the advantage of other neighboring states, especially Indiana. \"They\u2019re kicking our tails,\" is a frequent refrain.\nBut new data have rendered such comparisons problematic, making Texas a more appealing focus despite vast differences from Illinois in economy and population.\nIn 2017, while Illinois saw a modest gain in its unionized workforce, Indiana lost more than 37,000 union jobs, according to data from Unionstats.com, a long-running tally of federally compiled employment numbers for union workers created by professors at Georgia State University and Trinity University.\nWhat\u2019s more, other federal data show Illinois workers employed in the manufacturing sector \u2014 the closest approximation to Rauner\u2019s reference to factory workers \u2014 make an average $9,200 more per year than their counterparts in Indiana.\nA Rauner spokeswoman did not respond to our questions about why the governor in his recent talk stressed comparisons with Texas and not Indiana or other neighboring right-to-work states. She did, however, point us to U.S. Census Bureau data showing that Texas in 2017 added more than 52,000 private-sector union jobs while Illinois lost over 9,000. The distinction between private-sector versus total union jobs, however, was not one made by Rauner during the event.\nAs for pay, his spokeswoman noted that other federal data show manufacturing workers in Texas make, on average, $100-a-week more than their Illinois counterparts.\n\n"}

Rick says he'll create at least 2.5 million jobs as president. \"And I know something about that,\" Perry says. \"In Texas, we created over 1 million new jobs while the rest of the nation lost over 2 million.\"\n\nPerry aired a similar claim at the top of the Sept. 7, 2011, Republican presidential debate at the Reagan presidential library in California after NBC News anchor Brian Williams asked whether Texas, with its poverty rates and highest-in-the-nation share of minimum-wage workers, is the \"kind of answer Americans are looking for.\"\n\n\"Actually, what Americans are looking for is someone who can get this country working again,\" Perry replied. \"And we put the model in place in the state of Texas. When you look at what we have done over the last decade, we created 1 million jobs in the state of Texas. At the same time, America lost 2.5 million.\"\n\nWe dug into Perry\u2019s statement in a September fact-check, rating his claim Half True.\n\nWithout question, Texas has enjoyed phenomenal job growth over most of the time Perry has been governor, though how much came because of his leadership \u2014 or any state-level actions \u2014 is debatable. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney hinted as much in the Sept. 7 debate, saying: \"Texas is a great state. Texas has zero income tax. Texas has a right-to-work state, a Republican Legislature, a Republican Supreme Court. Texas has a lot of oil and gas in the ground. Those are wonderful things, but Gov. Perry doesn't believe that he created those things.\"\n\nIn a post-debate interview, economist Thomas Saving, director of Texas A&M University\u2019s Private Enterprise Research Center, told us that Texas has relatively low state debt and endured less of a housing bubble than many states. Still, he said, the state's economy might have been strong over the past decade regardless of who was governor.\n\nPia Orrenius, an economist for the Dallas branch of the Federal Reserve Bank, told us in a June interview that the Texas economy has been roaring since 1990. \"Long before Rick Perry\" became governor, she said, \"we were talking about the great Texas economy. There are so many exciting things about the Texas economy that precede any political flavor of the month.\" She listed as favorable factors the state's range of natural resources, its energy and high-tech sectors, its booming Gulf ports and its surging trade with Mexico and China.\n\nAlso, we recognize that job-gain claims can overreach. An example: Perry\u2019s January 2009 claim that about 70 percent of the U.S. jobs created between November 2007 and November 2008 were in Texas. We rated that claim False because the percentage was based on comparing new jobs in Texas with new jobs in 13 other states and the District of Columbia where job gains outnumbered losses; it ignored jobs created in 36 states where job losses overall outnumbered gains.\n\nBack to 2011: Perry\u2019s campaign said in an Oct. 26 press release that the jobs statement in his Iowa ad is based on a comparison of the change in the number of Texas' nonfarm jobs during Perry's tenure as governor with the change in the rest of the nation.\n\nIn December 2000, when Perry became governor, Texas had 9.5 million jobs while the other 49 states and the District of Columbia had 123.0 million. And in September 2011, Texas had 10.6 million jobs while the rest of the country had 120.6 million.\n\n"}

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., to say the economy is bouncing back from the recession.\nOn NBC\u2019s Meet the Press March 8, host Chuck Todd noted that unemployment is at its lowest since May 2008. And in 2014, unemployment went down in every state \u2014 a first since 1984. Todd asked Graham if Republicans \u2014 who have criticized President Barack Obama\u2019s economic policies \u2014 could admit that some progress has been made.\n\"I think that we do have stagnant middle-class wage growth, and I think the labor participation rate is at an all-time low,\" Graham said. \"So if your argument is that we\u2019re on the road to recovery, we had a sound economy under President Obama, no I don\u2019t agree with that at all.\"\nPointing out that the labor participation rate has been on the decline is a typical retort among Republicans\u00a0in response to arguments that the unemployment rate is shrinking. While low unemployment rate is generally a good thing, economists also say you want a high labor participation rate. That\u2019s because the higher the rate, the more members of the working-age population that are actively seeking employment.\nBut is today\u2019s labor participation rate at an \"all-time low\"? Not so.\nAs of February, the labor participation rate is 62.8 percent, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nRates were consistently lower than what they are today from 1948 through 1978 \u2014 with the lowest point at 58.1 percent in December 1954. (Available data goes back to 1948.)\nBelow is a graph showing the trend since 1950:\n\nIn fairness to Graham, today\u2019s labor participation rate is essentially the lowest it\u2019s been since 1978. The rate increased steadily from the mid 1960s through the late 1990s, when it hit a peak of 67 percent. Since Obama has been in office, the rate has dropped 2.9 percentage points.\nMuch of the increase in the labor participation rate in the second half of the 20th century largely has to do with a massive increase in the number of women seeking employment as a result of changes such as better access to contraceptives and anti-gender discrimination legislation, according to an economic report out of the White House, based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\nThis major social difference in the country\u2019s workforce makes it difficult to compare labor participation rates today to those 50 years ago.\n\n"}

Glenn Nye is her congressman, not ours.\" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee makes a similar claim in a TV ad, taking aim at Nye for supporting the economic stimulus package and other Democratic legislation. It says, \"Glenn Nye voted with Pelosi 82 percent of the time.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPolitiFact has checked similar claims in other states and found they often exaggerated the correlation with Pelosi, so we decided to take a closer look.\n\nAsked for the source for the claim, both Rigell\u2019s campaign and the NRCC cited a Washington Post voting database.\n\nWe took a look at the database and quickly discovered the campaigns had blurred the details: Nye has voted with his party 82.5 percent of the time since he took office in 2009. But his rate of voting with Pelosi is actually significantly lower -- just 66 percent.\n\nThe Washington Post says its database shows \"the percentage of votes on which a lawmaker agrees with the position taken by a majority of his or her party members\" -- not the correlation with a particular party leader.\n\nThe average party loyalty is 90.6 percent for all House members and 92.2 percent for the 263 Democratic members. But contrary to the implication of the ad, Nye is actually ninth from the bottom for party loyalty among Democrats and Republicans. That indicates he has one of the most independent records.\n\nComparing the voting records of a member of Congress and a House speaker can be misleading because the speaker rarely votes. The Washington Post voting database shows Pelosi has voted 94 times since the start of 2009, while Nye has cast 1,551 votes.\n\n\"That is just a tradition for speakers -- they often don't vote,\" Pelosi spokesman Brendan Daly told PolitiFact. \"She votes on some bills, not all.\"\n\nOf the 91 times when they both voted on matters other than the routine roll call, Nye cast differing votes 31 times.

Nye voted against it, and has touted that vote in his campaign. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAnd before voting with fellow Democrats to pass the economic stimulus bill in February 2009, Nye voted twice with Republicans to delay action on the plan, saying he wanted more time and more tax cuts.\n\nSo let\u2019s take stock of the facts.\n\nRigell\u2019s ad says Nye \"voted in lockstep with Nancy Pelosi.\" But the facts don\u2019t support such a strong claim.\n\nIt is incorrect for Rigell to say Nye voted with Pelosi 82 percent of the time. That is the percentage for his votes with his party. The actual number with Pelosi is significantly lower -- \u00a066 percent. And both measurements show he is one of the more independent Democrats. Only eight House members have lower party loyalty percentages.\n\nIt\u2019s become a popular Republican tactic to link Democrats with Pelosi, but in this case, the voting records don\u2019t justify the charge.

The public option was an alternative to a \"single payer system\" or so called \"Medicare for all.\" It was floated in part to appease more liberal Democrats who were critical of the bill\u2019s reliance on private health insurers.\n\nWe rated Mostly True a claim by GOP Senate candidate Tommy Thompson that Baldwin \"wants a health care system that is completely government controlled\" and goes beyond ObamaCare. In that item, we noted Baldwin favored a public option or a single-payer system.\n\nBut the thrust of the claim was that the public option was \"wildly unpopular.\" That is, Baldwin took a position most people at the time opposed.\n\nWe asked the U.S. Chamber, which wants to repeal the health care law, for backup for its claim. The group cited two public opinion surveys: An NBC News poll (August 2009) found a 47 percent plurality against the public option and a Rasmussen Reports voters\u2019 poll (July 2009) showed only 35 percent support.\n\nBut what about other polls taken at the time?\n\nWe turned to the archives of the respected Roper Center for Public Opinion Research, which maintains a huge database mostly of media and commercial polls.\n\nWith help from Roper, we found 32 poll questions that asked directly about the public option from April 2009 to March 2010, when the law passed. They were from polls by or for Gallup, Bloomberg, the Kaiser Family Foundation, NBC/Wall Street Journal, CNN, the Independent Women\u2019s Forum, CBS, the Democracy Corps, ABC/Washington Post and others.\n\nIn other words, mostly polls by or for the mainstream media and established polling organizations, with a sprinkling of surveys for groups with ideological leanings on the left and right.\n\nHere\u2019s what we found:\n\n-- Of the 32 polls, support for the public option outweighed opposition in 28 of them.\n\n-- Across those 28 polls, the average size of the group that favored the option was 57 percent. The opposition group averaged 38 percent in those polls.\n\n-- There were four polls in which opposition was stronger than support; 53 percent was the average size of the negative group in those polls. One was the NBC poll pointed out to us by the Chamber of Commerce.\nThe Rasmussen poll did not turn up in our search. But it did show -- as the Chamber said -- only 35 percent of likely voters supported a public option.

Since there was no vaccine for the virus and no antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections, control efforts were largely limited to social distancing and quarantines, which were applied unevenly.\nDuring her press conference, Whitmer pointed to a chart by National Geographic, which displayed the findings of a 2007 study about the death rates in 43 cities during the 1918 pandemic. The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association and written by researchers from the University of Michigan Medical School and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0\nTwo of the authors summarized their findings in the Washington Post in April.\n\"The experience of 1918 also reminds us that early, layered (i.e., more than one at the same time) and lengthy mitigation measures are the best strategy. For social distancing to work, it must be sweeping and enforced across a wide swath of the community,\" wrote Howard Markel and J. Alexander Navarro.\nThe researchers examined social distancing in 43 cities during about 24 weeks in 1918-19. Public gathering bans typically meant the closure of saloons, public entertainment venues and sporting events. Indoor gatherings were banned or moved outdoors.\u00a0\nResearchers found that cities that implemented social distancing in a timely and comprehensive manner and sustained those rules suffered the least.\nSt. Louis, for example, implemented a relatively early, layered strategy that included school closures and the cancellation of public gatherings. It sustained those interventions for about 10 weeks and did not experience nearly as harmful an outbreak as 36 other communities.\u00a0\nConversely, Philadelphia held a massive Liberty Bond Parade to bolster the World War I effort. That led to a spike of thousands of flu cases within days. In Atlanta, the mayor sided with the business community and ended closures after three weeks, despite objections from the board of health.

Let\u2019s take a closer look.\nWhere does the 300,000 figure come from?\nStephen Miller, a spokesman for Trump, directed us to Jessica M. Vaughan, the director of policy studies with the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors stricter immigration policies. (Officially, the center\u2019s website says the group\u2019s research has convinced many of its staff to be \"animated by a \u2018low-immigration, pro-immigrant\u2019 vision of an America that admits fewer immigrants but affords a warmer welcome for those who are admitted.\")\nVaughan said that the 300,000 estimate comes from three distinct numbers.\n\u2022 In fiscal years 2013, 2014 and 2015, Immigration and Customs Enforcement released a cumulative 86,288 criminal aliens from custody pending removal proceedings. (That number has actually fallen year by year, from 36,007 to 30,558 to 19,723.) This number was announced by Sarah R. Saldana, ICE\u2019s director, at a hearing by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on April 28, 2016. According to the committee\u2019s chairman, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, these 86,288 criminal aliens collectively were convicted of more than 231,000 crimes.\n\u2022 From Jan 1, 2014, to Sept. 30, 2015, state and local law enforcement agencies turned down 18,646 requests by ICE to hold deportable aliens arrested for non-immigration-related crimes until ICE could take them into custody. This figure was verified by ICE during an investigation by the Texas Tribune.\n\u2022 Vaughan has calculated that between 2013 and 2015, ICE officers, due to prosecutorial discretion, \"let off more than 200,000 criminal aliens they encountered, instead of initiating deportation. Most of these were in local custody at the time. The encounters were hands-on, usually interviews at a jail \u2013 not just reviewing a list or getting a hit in a database.\"\nVaughan said this number comes from internal ICE\u00a0reports on enforcement activity -- the Weekly Report on Departures and Detention. The original documents are cited in the footnotes of Vaughan\u2019s work here, here and here.\nIf you put these three figures together, they add up to roughly 300,000.\nHow solid is the 300,000 number?\nOn purely numerical grounds, the experts we checked with didn\u2019t express much concern about the first two categories, which collectively add up to about 105,000 individuals. The 200,000 figure is more controversial, however.\nPart of the concern stems from relying heavily on Vaughan\u2019s calculations of ICE data, made necessary in part because the numbers from ICE are often opaque, hard to obtain, or both.\nAdam Cox, a law professor at New York University who has studied the issue, said that Vaughn offers \"no evidence about whether there was actually probable cause under the law to arrest most of those who\u00a0were not arrested. The report treats every encounter by an ICE agent as one in which we know there could have been an arrest. But as we know from many studies in lots of policing contexts, many police encounters end without an arrest because there is no basis for an arrest to be made.\"\n\n"}

But neither of the actions comprise an outright ban on the drug.\nTake Nevada, for example. On March 24, Sisolak signed an emergency regulation that safeguards the supply of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which is sold under the brand name Plaquenil and as a generic. The order prohibits doctors in outpatient settings from prescribing and dispensing the drugs for COVID-19 treatment. It also limits prescriptions to 30-day supplies.\n\"While the two drugs serve necessary medical purposes, there is no conclusive evidence at this time among COVID-19 experts or Nevada\u2019s own medical health advisory team that the drugs provide treatment for COVID-19 patients,\" Sisolak said during a press conference. \"The emergency regulation is aimed at preventing the hoarding of the drugs so those that actually need them can have access to them.\"\nAs several news outlets have reported, physicians around the country have started to prescribe themselves chloroquine in order to hoard it for their families. That hoarding has led to drug shortages in some parts of the country, affecting patients who take chloroquine regularly to treat conditions like lupus and arthritis.\nConservative organizations like Turning Point USA took Nevada\u2019s order to mean Sisolak was banning any use of chloroquine for COVID-19 patients. But there is an exemption to the order.\u00a0\nRELATED: Conservative group's meme distorts Nevada\u2019s chloroquine restrictions\nA spokesman for Sisolak told KSNV-TV in Las Vegas that the regulation allows for a \"chart order for an inpatient in an institutional setting,\" meaning that doctors in hospitals and emergency rooms can still prescribe chloroquine to treat patients diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\n"}

The image has a word bubble coming from Rubio's mouth that says, \"Solo Ingles,\" which means English only.\n\nThe claim got our attention because Rubio is a child of Cuban immigrants who speaks both Spanish and English fluently. Rubio also has been airing an ad for his Senate campaign in Spanish. So we wondered if it is true.\n\nThere's no doubt Rubio supports English as the official language of the United States.\n\nIn June 2009, Rubio said, \"We have to have a common language that unites the people,'' and said that language should be English.\n\nIn September 2009, Rubio campaign spokesman Alex Burgos reiterated that position, which Rubio again confirmed during a Univision debate. \"Marco believes learning English is essential for success in the United States, and should be the official and unifying language of America,\" Burgos told a reporter.\n\nBut while there's no doubt Rubio supports English as the official language, there's also no doubt he opposes any proposal to ban other languages.\n\nFrom that same June 2009 interview -- \"I'm not in favor of banning other languages, but my name is spelled the same way in Spanish as it is in English.\"\n\nAnd then again from the Univision debate in September -- \"That doesn't mean English only,\" he says. \"People should learn as many languages as they can \u2026 But the most important thing that recent arrivals can do for their children is make them proficient in the English language.\"\n\nWhat's the impact of making English the official language?

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "National Republican Congressional Committee Gas prices have gone up 99 percent since Obama became president, \"the highest gas price increase since Carter.\"", "evidence": "We received an email from the National Republican Congressional Committee recently that blamed the country\u2019s high gas prices on the Obama administration and Democrats in Congress.\n\nThe news release, which specifically targeted Rhode Island Democratic U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, posited several reasons why gas prices have skyrocketed, including unreasonable environmental regulations and too few offshore drilling permits.\n\nThe overall effect on gas prices has been historic, according to the GOP committee.\n\n\"99%: THE AMOUNT GAS PRICES HAVE INCREASED UNDER OBAMA, THE HIGHEST GAS PRICE INCREASE SINCE CARTER,\" the April 20 email blared.\n\nA quick check of two numbers in the release -- $1.928 per gallon, the national average price of regular, unleaded gas in February 2009, versus $3.843 per gallon, the price on March 29, 2012 -- confirmed that prices have indeed climbed by 99 percent since Obama\u2019s inauguration.\n\nBut what about the second part of the claim: is this really the highest increase since Jimmy Carter was president more than three decades ago? And is the implication that Obama is responsible for the increase accurate?\n\nAt PolitiFact, we treat these types of blame/credit statements in two parts. We examine whether the numbers are right and how much experts say the person being blamed is responsible.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the claim that the gas price increase is the highest since the Carter administration.\n\nNathaniel Sillin, a spokesman for the NRCC, told us that the group came to that conclusion by looking at the presidencies from Carter onward and comparing the average gas price at the beginning of each president\u2019s time in office with the price at the end. Since Obama is still in office, the committee is using the most recent price of gas for the number during his presidency. Sillin sent us a chart updated with the average price of gas from April 4.\n\nThe chart showed that under Carter the price of gas increased by 103 percent; under Ronald Reagan it dropped by 66 percent; under George H.W. Bush it went up 20 percent; under Bill Clinton it increased 32 percent; under George W. Bush it rose 20 percent; and so far under Obama it has gone up 104 percent.\n\nSo according to the updated chart the NRCC could actually claim that the increase is higher than that under Carter.\n\nThe NRCC chart was based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and AAA. We decided to check their prices with the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the official statistical and analytical arm of the Department of Energy.\n\nThe only major difference we found using the EIA data was that the drop in price under Reagan wasn\u2019t as dramatic as the NRCC said. Instead of a 66-percent decrease, the EIA database gave us a still healthy decrease of 37 percent. And using the EIA data, the increase under Obama so far is actually 107 percent.\n\nBut we have two main questions about the NRCC\u2019s claim.\n\nFirst, is it fair to compare gas prices during Obama\u2019s presidency in April to prices for his predecessors in January? Historically, gas prices generally rise through the summer, and fall in the autumn -- and this year they are projected to once again follow that pattern. (The price peaked last year in May.)\n\nFor an extreme example, look at 2008, during George W. Bush\u2019s presidency, when gas prices skyrocketed to more than $4 a gallon that July and plummeted to $1.79 a gallon the following January. If we look at the price that April -- the same month the NRCC used for Obama in its claim -- and compare it to the first month of Bush\u2019s term, then the increase would have been 139 percent.\n\nThat increase is in fact higher than Carter\u2019s 103 percent or Obama\u2019s 107 percent. And if we use the highest price in 2008, from August, and compare it with Bush\u2019s first month in office, the increase is a whopping 180 percent.\n\nWe also calculated the increase using precisely the same length of time for Bush that the NRCC used for Obama. So we compared the price in February 2005, the first month of his second term, to the price in April 2008 and came up with an increase of 81 percent. When we did the same calculation using January 2009 as the end date, we came up with a decrease of 6 percent. Again, this demonstrates how prices can change seasonally.\n\nOur second major question relates to the premise of the NRCC\u2019s assertion -- that Obama is responsible for high gas prices. How much control does a president really have over gas prices?\n\n\"Virtually none,\" Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst for Oil Price Information Service of New Jersey, told us. \"The real factors are global.\"\n\n\"Oil is a global market in which America is a big consumer but a small supplier,\" Richard Thaler, a University of Chicago economist who has donated to Obama and informally advised his administration, wrote in The New York Times. \"We consume about 20 percent of the world\u2019s oil but hold only 2 percent of the oil reserves. That means we are, in economics jargon, \u2018price takers.\u2019\n\n\"Domestic production has increased during the Obama administration, but it has had minimal effects on global prices because, as producers, we are just too small to matter much. And even if domestic oil companies further increased production, they would sell to the highest global bidder.\"\n\nWith supplies tightening because of conflicts in North Africa and the Middle East and demand growing in China and Japan (which shut down its fleet of nuclear power plants), the price of oil is going up, according to analysts. Fears about a disruption to oil production in Iran have increased the upward pressure.\n\n\"Unfortunately, presidents get blamed for world market changes that occur during their time in office... but generally, they do not cause them,\" wrote Peter Van Doren and Jerry Taylor, senior fellows at the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington, D.C.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee said that gas prices have increased by 99 percent since Obama became president and that it\u2019s \"the highest gas price increase since Carter.\"\n\nThe NRCC framed the question in such a way that it didn\u2019t make an apples-to-apples comparison between presidencies. Seasonal fluctuations in gas prices could easily change the NRCC\u2019s calculation for Obama\u2019s presidency -- a variation the committee didn\u2019t note in its news release.\n\nIt also didn\u2019t say that it was comparing the first and last months of a president\u2019s term. The release implies that gas prices haven\u2019t risen so high percentage-wise at any time under any other president since Carter.\n\nBut that\u2019s not true. When George W. Bush was in office, the national average price rose much higher by percent before falling.\n\nFinally, blaming presidents for gas prices is missing the point. Presidents have little control over them. The global economy is the prime factor.\n\nWe rule the statement Mostly False.\n\n(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

Merriam-Webster follows the definition with this sample sentence: \"Town halls have lost some of their spontaneity.

Scott Walker explain why he proposed more spending for mental health care in his 2013-2015 budget.\n\n\"Nationally, serious mental illness costs at least $193 billion a year in lost earnings,\" Walker said during his Feb. 20, 2013, budget presentation. \"In Wisconsin, only half of all the adults with serious psychological distress received mental health treatment or medication.\"\n\nIn the course of his remarks, Walker used two different terms -- \"serious mental illness\" and \"serious psychological distress.\" He used the second to illustrate lack of care.\n\nIs he correct that only half of Wisconsin adults with \"serious psychological distress\" receive care?\n\nBackdrop: mass shootings\n\nWalker didn\u2019t mention mass shootings in his budget address, but he alluded to them two weeks earlier when he revealed his plan to boost mental health spending by $29 million over two years.\n\nThe National Alliance on Mental Illness Wisconsin praised the spending boost, which would be done from several different pots of money.But the advocacy group said Walker\u2019s rejection of a federal proposal to expand Medicaid \"reflects a shallow understanding\" of \"crucial means to affordable mental health care for Wisconsin residents.\"\n\nIn revealing his plans, the governor stopped short of drawing a clear link between treating mental illness and preventing mass shootings, but indicated his plan took on greater urgency after mass killings in 2012.\n\nThose incidents included the shooting deaths of six worshippers at a Sikh temple outside of Milwaukee and of 26 children and adults at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.\n\nTo be clear, only about 1 percent of people with mental illness considered to be severe are regarded as dangerous. But a 2011 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u00a0report found that this group can pose a dilemma for policy-makers, who lack the data to develop a sound system for dealing with it.\n\nWalker\u2019s budget, which could be modified by the Legislature, includes $12.6 million to treat more patients who have been committed to mental hospitals, $10.2 million to expand community-based care programs for people with severe mental illness and $3.8 million for more coordination of care for children with behavioral issues.\n\nWalker\u2019s evidence\n\nWhen we asked Walker\u2019s office for evidence to back his claim, we were initially referred to a January 2013 report by his Department of Health Services. The report estimated, based on a federal survey of American adults, that in 2011, 49 percent of the 1 million adults in Wisconsin who had \"any mental illness\" did not get treatment.\n\nAny mental illness refers to people who have a \"diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder.\" The disorder causes impairment -- ranging from mild to moderate to substantial -- in carrying out major life activities.\n\nThe 49 percent figure cited in the health department\u2019s report might appear to support Walker\u2019s claim.\n\nBut his claim about Wisconsin didn\u2019t use the term mental illness. It used the phrase \"serious psychological distress.\"\n\nWe pointed out the difference to Stephanie Smiley, spokeswoman for the department. She then cited federal survey data showing that over a two-year period -- 2010 to 2011 -- an estimated 51 percent of Wisconsin adults with \"serious psychological distress\" did not get treatment in the previous year.\n\n(She also said that in 2008-2009, 31 percent of state adults with serious mental illness got treatment.)\n\nSo, the 51 percent figure about serious psychological distress appears to back Walker\u2019s claim.\n\nBut let\u2019s understand serious psychological distress as compared to serious mental illness, given that mental illness was the focus of Walker\u2019s comments and his proposed spending increase.\n\n"}

Butch Otter, who\u2019s seeking his third term, and three Republicans seeking to defeat him in a primary. One, Russ Fulcher, is a state senator who\u2019s running against Otter from the right. The other two were more colorful -- Harley Brown, a biker sporting leather gear and fingerless gloves, and Walt Bayes, a homeschooling activist with a prodigious beard and \"77 descendants.\"\nThe debate produced enough colorful moments that it quickly went viral -- for instance, when Brown said, \"I'm about as politically correct as your proverbial turd in a punch bowl,\" or when Bayes closed with a warning about nuclear contamination.\nAs intriguing as those claims are, we\u2019re going to focus instead on a wonkier assertion made by Fulcher.\nReferring to Otter\u2019s decision to create a state-based marketplace under President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law, Fulcher said Otter didn\u2019t oppose Obamacare strongly enough, adding, \"Idaho was the only Republican-led state in the nation that chose to partner with President Obama.\"\nWe decided to see if he was correct. (Fulcher\u2019s campaign did not reply to an inquiry for this fact-check.)\nFirst, some background. Under the Affordable Care Act, states had three choices for creating an online marketplace that residents could use to browse health insurance plans and purchase the one that would best fit their needs and budget. States were allowed to create their own online marketplace; they could partner with the federal government to create a hybrid state-federal site; or they could do nothing, in which case residents would instead use the federal healthcare.gov site by default. Idaho took the first option of starting its own marketplace.\nThe Affordable Care Act has been a target of Republican criticism generally, nowhere more than in strongly conservative states like Idaho. But while Otter was -- and is -- critical of the law overall, he said he decided to push for a state-run online marketplace in order to make sure Idaho would be able to have some control of how the law is implemented.\nIn pushing for the creation of a state-run marketplace, Otter faced resistance within the GOP-dominated state House and Senate. But he ultimately cobbled together a coalition of Democrats and some Republicans to pass legislation that authorized a state-based marketplace. Otter signed the law on March 28, 2013.\n\n"}

But she said the governor\u2019s push for Senate Bill 221 \u2014 which became law in 2008 and placed tighter reins on utility companies seeking to set market-based pricing \u2014 prevented Ohio\u2019s rates from skyrocketing as rates did in other states where wholesale market pricing was unchecked.\n\nThe question: Are Ohio\u2019s rates today a full 10 percent below the national average as the governor claimed? The governor\u2019s campaign staff said it relied on information from the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Energy Information Administration, or EIA, for its figures.\n\nAccording to EIA\u2019s most recent average retail price report, released June 16 and updated through March, Ohio\u2019s average electricity price for all sectors this year was 8.72 cents per kilowatt hour. The national average was 9.5 cents.

However, Trump beat Hillary Clinton in the district by only 1.5 percentage points in 2016 -- well below the usual Republican performance -- giving Democrats hope that Ossoff could win the April 18 special election.\nPolls show Ossoff leading the multi-party field, with Republican candidates splitting the rest of the vote. If he can get to 50 percent, Ossoff could win the seat outright without having to compete in a runoff. That possibility has prompted Democrats from across the country to flood his war chest with donations.\nThe question of Ossoff\u2019s national security background first came up in the news release announcing his campaign on Jan. 5. \"A Georgia native who grew up in the Sixth District, Ossoff served Georgia as a national security staffer in Congress for five years before leaving government for the private sector,\" the release reads.\nOssoff, 30, continued to emphasize his experience on the campaign trail, such as in a campaign appearance and on this podcast.\nHowever, opponents raised questions about his experience, noting that Ossoff had worked on Capitol Hill between 2007 and 2012 but had only earned his undergraduate degree from Georgetown University in 2009. That would make him a pretty junior staffer to be touting his national security experience.\nWe decided to take a closer look.\nThe timeline\nAfter the criticism emerged, Ossoff\u2019s campaign released a timeline of his years on Capitol Hill. Here it is:\n\u2022 January 2007: Starts working for Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., as a part-time legislative correspondent, working 25-30 hours a week while attending Georgetown's School of Foreign Service.\n\u2022 May 2009: Graduates from Georgetown's School of Foreign Service.\n\u2022 Summer 2009: Spends the summer traveling before he returns to work as a legislative assistant for Johnson in August 2009.\n\u2022 January 2010: Promoted to senior legislative assistant.\n\u2022 April-July 2010: Runs Johnson's re-election campaign.\n\u2022 September 2010: Returns to Johnson's Capitol Hill office.\n\u2022 March 2012: Receives a top-secret security clearance and staffs Johnson for all work related to the annual National Defense Authorization Act.\n\u2022 Mid August 2012: Leaves Johnson's office.\nThis timeline, which appears to match the congressional staff records we were able to find, confirms that Ossoff did indeed work as a congressional staffer for five years.\nWhy this raises legitimate questions\nHowever, it\u2019s important to keep in mind some important context about Ossoff\u2019s first two years on Johnson\u2019s staff. During those two years, Ossoff was working with the office only on a part-time basis and hadn\u2019t received his undergraduate degree yet.\nMoreover, his title -- legislative correspondent -- is not exactly a lofty one. Here\u2019s how the Congressional Management Foundation describes it: \"Researches and writes legislative correspondence; conducts legislative research; assists legislative assistants as needed.\"\nIn other words, the primary job of a legislative correspondent is to answer mail from the lawmaker\u2019s constituents and to backfill for more senior office staffers when necessary.\nIn 2009, one of the years Ossoff held the position, the median salary for a legislative correspondent was $38,875, more than the $37,504 for a staff assistant and well below the next rung up on the ladder -- legislative assistant at $50,500, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\n"}
{"label": "pants-fire", "claim": "Zack Space A bill to save teacher jobs is completely paid for by closing corporate tax loopholes.", "evidence": "Short-term memory loss was rampant among many Democrats in Congress in August, when they passed a $26 billion bill to provide money to help states avert teacher layoffs and health program cuts. They said the measure was paid for entirely by closing corporate tax loopholes, and they studiously avoided mentioning an even bigger source of money for the bill: a nearly $12 billion cut in future food stamp spending. Taking money from the poor to pay for teachers was not a discussion they relished.\n\nMemories have not improved over time, as a Sept. 2 letter from U.S. Rep Zack Space shows.\n\nSpace, from Ohio\u2019s 18th Congressional District, wrote to Jack Frech, who heads the Job and Family Services agency in Athens County, to defend the legislation after Frech called and left message for the east-central Ohio congressman. Space responded by saying the bill is \"providing badly needed funding for teacher jobs.\"\n\nFrech had worried about the growing ranks of poor and low-income Ohioans in this sluggish economy. But the activist in him got especially fired up when he learned that Congress was going to help states and local communities meet their needs for teachers and health care providers who serve the poor -- while cutting back on an earlier expansion of food stamp spending. So he contacted Space, and Space responded with his letter on Sept. 2.\n\nSpace wrote that threatened teacher cuts, and their effect on students, would have been \"intolerable.\" Three hundred teachers in his district alone had been in jeopardy, Space wrote.\n\n\"This bill will save teacher jobs immediately, and it is completely paid for -- by closing an egregious tax loophole that encourages American companies to ship jobs overseas,\" Space\u2019s letter said. \"It goes without saying that we could badly use that money here at home to ensure all our children get a decent education. I refuse to support policies that sell out our children, our future, to overseas corporate interests.\"\n\nSpace told Frech in the letter that \" I recognize that you had reservations about this provision; however, I wasn\u2019t elected to simply stand on the sidelines while Ohio teachers are pushed out of the classroom.\"\n\nThis sounds noble enough. For purposes of discussion, PolitiFact Ohio will put aside any dissent from Republicans over whether the move to save local teacher jobs was the right thing for Congress to do at this time, because that\u2019s not Frech\u2019s point. Nor is his point whether a teacher-layoff crisis really loomed, a debate that continues with a recent Columbus Dispatch survey of the state\u2019s largest school districts that found many had no layoff plans and put the money aside in case they need it later.\n\nFrech\u2019s complaint is simpler: Did Congress really have to take the money from a program that helps the poor? Couldn\u2019t it have found the money somewhere else?\n\nBecause we were in touch with Frech when reporting on this issue this summer, Frech shared the letter with us, as he has with others. Frech is a leading anti-poverty voice in southeastern Ohio.\n\nSo what of Space\u2019s claim in the correspondence that the teacher bill was completely paid for by closing the corporate loophole?\n\nThe Plain Dealer has been through that one before, and noted its fallacy on Cleveland.com. PolitiFact\u2019s national operation has been through it, too, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi made the same claim in a press release.\n\nAs PolitiFact said on Aug. 13, several days after Pelosi\u2019s statement:\n\n\"According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, the corporate tax changes in the bill that Pelosi is referring to will amount to $9.8 billion between 2010 and 2020. These are a mix of tax policies that only a CPA could understand, from \u2018rules to prevent splitting foreign tax credits from the income to which they relate\u2019 (worth almost $4.3 billion in newly captured revenue) to \u2018denial of foreign tax credit with respect to foreign income not subject to United States taxation by reason of covered asset acquisitions\u2019 (worth more than $3.6 billion), to \u2018limitation on the amount of foreign taxes deemed paid with respect to section 956 inclusions\u2019 (worth $704 million).\n\n\"But that $9.8 billion in corporate tax cuts won't cover the full $26 billion cost of the bill. The bulk of the money comes from something Pelosi's office chose not to mention in the press release -- almost $12 billion in cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (more commonly known as the food stamp program) beginning in 2014. Another $1.1 billion would come from cuts to advanced refundability of the earned income tax credit starting in 2011. The earned income credit is a tax credit that benefits the working poor. Several billion dollars more would come from a variety of spending cuts known as rescissions.\"\n\nPelosi and other Democrats, including Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, have said separately that they hope to restore the food stamp funding before the cuts kick in in 2014. And Pelosi\u2019s office in July at least offered a fact-sheet on the teacher bill\u2019s funding that included the food stamp cuts.\n\nSpace\u2019s letter to Frech was silent on that, however.\n\nPolitiFact gave Pelosi\u2019s statement a Barely True rating, noting that at least her office had provided details of the food stamp cuts in other settings. But we have seen no instances of Space acknowledging the food stamp cuts.\n\nSpace, like most other Ohio Democrats, was silent on the cuts when a group of the Ohio members held their own news conference after the Aug. 10 vote, hailing its passage. Had Rep. Marcia Fudge of Warrensville Heights not broken that press conference silence by mentioning the cuts, the lawmakers would have moved on without breaking stride.\n\nThat\u2019s not saying they are happy to pare back federal spending on the poor. When the subject is brought up by reporters, most say they voted for the bill reluctantly, choosing among the limited options that congressional leaders and the White House gave them -- options they say they were forced to swallow in order to make the bill budget-neutral. That was the only way to win key Republican votes in the Senate.\n\nStuart Chapman, chief of staff to Space, told us in an e-mail that \"no one has been a more aggressive advocate for the dispossessed in in Southeastern Ohio than Congressman Space.\" Space has fought for other anti-poverty programs, he said, a point reiterated by a phone call we received soon after speaking with Chapman, from Lisa Hamler-Fugitt, executive director of the Ohio Association of Second-Harvest Foodbanks.\n\nHamler-Fugitt said that Space works hard to help the poor. But Hamler-Fugitt agrees with Frech\u2019s point as well -- that \"we\u2019re all outraged\" at the way the food-stamp cut was passed.\n\nThat gets us back to Space\u2019s letter. Frech, well-recognized in southeast Ohio for his work, had contacted Space to complain about one facet of one bill. \u00a0Space not only neglected to address it; he wrote something that was untrue by saying the teacher-aid bill was paid for entirely by closing a tax loophole.\n\nAnd Space certainly knew about the food-stamp cut, if for no other reason than he was present at the news conference where Fudge raised the issue. That doesn\u2019t make him the grinch who stole food stamps. It merely makes him one more member of Congress who has tried not to talk about it.\n\nChapman, the chief of staff, told us that a letter to a constituent is not intended \"to be a manual of every facet of legislation.\" But Frech didn\u2019t want a manual. By ignoring Frech\u2019s concern -- and passing right over the bill\u2019s single biggest funding source -- Space\u2019s letter took on the air of gamesmanship.\n\nHide and seek, anyone?\n\nWhen we run a statement through the Truth-O-Meter that not only is false but also suggests that someone is playing games, we start looking for the matches"}

In that regard, there is no national count of every single black scientist and where they went to school. There is some research, however, on how minority students fare as science majors at different universities.\nOn the raw numbers, the claim is \"likely to be true, but not for the reasons Scalia thinks it is,\" said Benjamin Backes, an affirmative action expert with the American Institutes for Research. Most black scientists likely did not go to schools like the University of Texas at Austin \u2014 that is to say, selective research universities.\nWhy?\nBecause the vast majority of students and science majors do not go to these elite institutions.\nFor reference, the American Association of Universities represents 62 leading research universities, which together house just 20\u00a0percent of all undergraduate science, math and engineering majors in the United States and Canada.\n\"Because the typical student, both black and non-black, does not attend a selective university, the typical scientist likely did not graduate from a selective institution,\" he said.\nLet\u2019s get back to the broader point of the statement: that black students perform better in science at \"lesser\" schools than the University of Texas.\n\n"}

Scott Walker has made headlines for years with his initiatives to ease regulatory burdens in the state after declaring during his Jan 3, 2011,\u00a0inaugural address that \"Wisconsin is open for business.\"\nBut has the Walker administration gone so far as to prevent Department of Natural Resources scientists from commenting on proposed legislation, and letting corporations draft their own permits?\nThat was the claim from former state Rep. Kelda Roys, one of eight Democrats hoping to face Walker in the November 2018 election.\nIn a May 2, 2018, interview with journalist Steve Walters of WisconsinEye, Roys claimed \"political interference\" from Walker\u2019s administration has led to \"gagging (DNR) scientists so they can no longer comment on proposed legislation.\" And, \"We're letting polluters write their own permits.\"\nLet\u2019s take a look at both parts of Roys\u2019 claim.\nThe changing role of DNR in legislation\nWhen asked for backup on the \"gagging\" part of the claim, the Roys campaign provided three news articles.\nTwo (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and Isthmus) reported a case in which DNR testimony was absent from a legislative hearing regarding chronic wasting disease and the baiting/feeding of white-tailed deer. The other, from Scientific American, carried this headline: \"How Scott Walker dismantled Wisconsin's environmental legacy.\"\nIn the March 23, 2017, Isthmus article, DNR Deputy Secretary Kurt Thiede is quoted as saying: \"The department does not take positions for or against legislation. When requested, the department appears at the public hearing for informational purposes when requested by either a committee chairman or a bill\u2019s primary author. This has been administration policy since 2011.\"\nWhen asked to comment, the Walker campaign referred us to the Republican Party of Wisconsin, which cited numerous instances where the department was asked to testify -- for information only -- at legislative hearings during Walker\u2019s administration: Assembly Bills 160, 203, and 668, and Senate Bills 228 and 368 among them.\nDNR communications director Jim Dick said since February 15, 2017, DNR staff have given informational testimony on 30 different topics during legislative hearings, met with legislators and/or their staff about once a week, and have fielded about 40 calls or emails a week to answer questions from lawmakers on various topics.\n\"In a three-year period (2014-2017),\" said Dick, \"we received and responded to more than 6,000 legislative inquiries. DNR staff does communicate with legislators and legislative staff frequently. But it is not our role to offer our opinion on whether a particular piece of legislation is right or wrong, good or bad.\"\nStill, the policy marks a change from the pre-Walker era.\nTom Hauge, who retired in 2016 after serving 25 years as wildlife director for the department, said staffers had more latitude in the past.\nAt any and every relevant hearing, he said, experts from the department would testify alongside the department\u2019s legislative liaison, taking a stand on whether the agency supported, opposed, or was neutral toward the proposed legislation.\nIf they found that the legislation would have negative impact \u2014 \"I don\u2019t just mean trivial,\" he added \u2014 they would take an official position in opposition at the hearings.\nShifting DNR\u2019s role to an invite-only, information-only basis hasn\u2019t necessarily reduced its \u00a0participation in legislative hearings, as the earlier numbers show. But there\u2019s no guarantee that they will be asked to attend.\nFor instance, the DNR was noticeably uninvited to the March 2017 hearing on Assembly Bill 61 which would lighten rules that prohibit baiting/feeding deer in counties with documented chronic wasting disease.\n\n"}

Supporters say the new rules prevent fraud.\n\nAs the debate intensifies, all sides are turning their attention to one of the first states to say paper identification isn\u2019t enough: Georgia.\n\nU.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey, a Marietta Republican, said in a recent article on the Fox News website that when the state passed its new rules in the mid-2000s, the state bent over backward to see that it disenfranchised no one.\n\nAfter the state tightened the voter ID laws, it told people, \"Look, we will literally send a van and a photographer to the home of anybody that can say they can't get a picture made and a photo ID and we will do it ... at the state's cost and the taxpayer cost and not at the individual cost,\" Gingrey said in the Dec. 28 article.\n\nThis was news to us. Since when did bureaucrats make house calls?\n\nWe asked Gingrey spokeswoman Jen Talaber, who told us about the Department of Driver Services\u2019 Georgia Licensing on Wheels, otherwise known as the GLOW bus.\n\nStarting September 2005, an aging Blue Bird lumbered across Georgia making voter IDs. The poor got theirs for free. The rest paid $5.\n\nThe rug was the color of oatmeal, a media report said. A bench was upholstered in vinyl.\n\nIt was a bit of a junker.\n\nLeaky hoses forced the rescheduling of stops in rural Pulaski and Wilcox counties, according to an article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. A bad alternator pushed back a visit to Statesboro. A battery problem made the GLOW bus late for a Cherokee County appearance.\n\nAnd the bus service wasn\u2019t nearly as convenient as Gingrey said. It did not go to individual homes. Instead, it stopped at gathering places such as the Augusta-Richmond County Civic Center and the Talbot County Courthouse west of Macon, according to a 2005 schedule.\n\n\"Appointments cannot be made for individuals,\" said a 2005 Department of Driver Services press release announcing the service.\n\nStill, it was the big bus that could. News accounts said the GLOW bus had the capacity to make as many as 200 cards a day.\n\nYet for the most part, it was the big bus that didn\u2019t.\n\nBetween Aug. 30 and Oct. 1, 2005, the GLOW bus issued 22 voter IDs, according to Department of Driver Services figures. Today, there are 559 active voter cards statewide that were issued through the department.\n\nThe bus service was ultimately canceled.\n\nSupporters and foes of Georgia\u2019s voter ID law debated why the GLOW bus was such a dud. Then-Gov. Sonny Perdue argued the numbers were proof there was no need for it. Others said the service wasn\u2019t well advertised, or that a single bus couldn\u2019t handle the needs of a large state.\n\nHelen Butler, executive director of the Georgia Coalition for the People's Agenda, a civil rights group, told PolitiFact Georgia that the bus didn\u2019t solve the cost problem. While a voter ID card is free, getting the documentation to obtain one isn\u2019t. It can cost $30 for a birth certificate, she said.\n\nSo yes, the GLOW bus existed. It made voter IDs for free.\n\nBut the state did not \"literally send a van and a photographer to the home of anybody that can say they can't get a picture made and a photo ID,\" as Gingrey said \u00a0\n\nThe GLOW bus didn\u2019t do house calls. \u00a0\n\nIt might have made getting a voter ID more convenient. And the fact that few used the bus might bolster Gingrey\u2019s argument that people who want the IDs don\u2019t need help.\n\nBut this is a far cry from door-to-door service. A wheelchair-bound senior with no car could not apply for an ID from her living room couch, as Gingrey\u2019s claim suggested. A civic group would have to request the van travel to a nearby civic center or courthouse, and an individual would have to trek there to get one.\n\nGingrey\u2019s statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression"}

How then to reconcile that claim with a city population swoon dating back to the 1950s?

Census data show the city\u2019s population peaked at 3.6 million in the official 1950 count.\nIt was a very different era. South Side steel mills were thriving and the stockyards of \"hog butcher to the world\" fame were humming. The postwar suburban boom was only in its infancy, and the expressway system that eventually would make reverse commutes feasible had yet to be laid out.\nJust shy of 1.5 million Chicago residents held private sector jobs, according to the 1950 census, more than one-third of which were in manufacturing industries. Back then, Chicago\u2019s workforce was still very much a collection of lunch-pail toting, blue-collar strap hangars, the decline of which is much lamented by politicians of today.\nThe city\u2019s population dwindled over the intervening decades, as did the number of jobs held by its residents. Today, the census pegs the city\u2019s population at 2.7 million, down 900,000 from its 1950 high. But as late as 1970, census data show the population stood at nearly 3.4 million, with 1.2 million employed in the private sector.\nYet Emanuel says private sector employment in the city is the highest ever.

Rick Perry was for Wall Street bailout before he was against it.", "evidence": "Amid economic turmoil, the U.S. Senate voted Oct. 1, 2008, to approve a $700 billion rescue of Wall Street, a decision joined by Texas Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long afterward that Hutchison drew the unflattering nickname of \"Kay Bailout\" from Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s camp, which was wary of Hutchison challenging Perry for governor this year.\n\nThe two revisited the bailout vote in Thursday's GOP gubernatorial debate when Hutchison reminded Perry that he\u2019d signed a letter sent members of Congress on the day of the pivotal Senate vote widely interpreted as urging lawmakers to proceed full speed ahead.\n\n\"You wrote a letter to Congress saying pass this bill, we need to shore up the financial markets,\" Hutchison said. \"\u2026Governor, you asked for it too. You were for it before you were against it.\"\n\nPerry conceded that he co-wrote a letter with West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin. But, he said, the governors \"thought you were smart enough to understand what we were talking about, stop the spending and cut the taxes.\"\n\n\"Governor,\" Hutchison replied, \"that\u2019s not what the letter said.\"\n\n\"I wish we\u2019d made it a little clearer for you,\" Perry said.\nMaybe Perry could have made it clearer for everybody. We wondered if Perry initially urged lawmakers to pass the bailout proposal after all.\n\nThis much is certain: On the morning of Oct. 1, 2008, the Republican Governors Association and Democratic Governors Association publicized a letter signed by their respective chairmen \u2014 Perry and Manchin \u2014 described by the groups as urging passage of an economic recovery package.\n\nThe three-paragraph letter states: \"We strongly urge Congress to leave partisanship at the door and pass an economic recovery package... If Congress does not act soon, the situation will grow appreciably worse.\"\n\nThe letter doesn\u2019t explicitly endorse the plan then before the Senate. But no other plan was in play that day amid national fears of an economic collapse. And The Associated Press cast the governors' letter as part of a frantic national push for the $700 billion bailout of Wall Street sought by President Bush.\n\nThat was before Perry issued a contradictory-sounding second statement later in the day, partly headlined: \"On Protecting Taxpayers.\"\n\n\"In a free market economy,\" Perry said, \"government should not be in the business of using taxpayer dollars to bail out corporate America.\"\n\nAsked to clarify at the time what Perry wanted the Senate to do, his spokeswoman, Allison Castle, demurred. \"The senators have to make their own decisions,\" Castle said.\n\nHutchison spokesman Matt Mackowiak stepped into the breach, opining: \"Texans can only conclude that Gov. Perry opposes the sales tax deduction, protecting them from the Alternative Minimum Tax, extending tax credits for refinery expansion and providing over $600 million in tax credits to help rebuild Texas communities damaged by Hurricane Ike, all of which are contained in this bill.\"\n\nAsked several months ago about Perry's dual messages, Perry spokesman Mark Miner saw nothing confusing. Miner said Perry simply favored tax and spending cuts over bailouts.\n\n\"You call on Congress to take action, nine times out of 10, the action they take is wrong,\" Miner said.\n\nAfter the debate, we took the candidates' advice and sought out Manchin (per Perry) and former President George W. Bush (per Hutchison) for their takes on this issue. Bush declined to comment while Manchin indicated he and Perry hadn't advocated any specific legislation.\n\nIn a comment delivered by a spokesman, Manchin said: \"You had to look at the situation our country was facing then. What we were urging was for Congress to work together in a bipartisan effort, and to follow the lead of the governors... to move the states ahead. That effort continues today.\"\n\nAt the time of the Senate action in 2008, Manchin said he supported his state's two senators, who voted for the Wall Street package. But he too sounded a contradictory note: \"I do not support a bailout. Nobody supports bailing somebody out on the backs of working people \u2026 for someone to profit on Wall Street.\"\n\nAll in all, it's easy to see Hutchison\u2019s rationale for charging Perry with being for the legislation before he was against it. The Manchin-Perry letter did urge action on the day the Senate was poised to take up the bailout package.\n\nBut Perry is correct that the joint letter didn\u2019t explicitly advocate the Senate plan. And his second Oct. 1, 2008, statement could be taken as a timely signal he didn\u2019t want Congress to rescue Wall Street the way it did\n\nOf course, Perry could have held his tongue entirely and spared himself the resulting questions and explanations"}

When she made that claim, we rated it Pants on Fire in 2008. Here\u2019s why.\nDuring an introduction to a foreign policy speech on Iraq on March 17, 2008, then-Sen. Hillary Clinton reminisced about her days as first lady and a trip to Tuzla, Bosnia, she made in March 1996.\n\"I remember landing under sniper fire. There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base.\"\nBut that's not what happened, as demonstrated by CBS News video that shows Clinton arriving on the tarmac under no visible duress, and greeting a child who offers her a copy of a poem. The Washington Post Fact Checker also turned a skeptical eye on Clinton's comments, reporting that a review of more than 100 news stories from the time documented no security threats to the First Lady.\nCBS reporter Sharyl Attkisson, who covered Clinton on the Bosnia visit, wrote of her memories of the trip: \"To be sure, it was not the 'safest' trip for a first lady to take: there were serious risks in traveling to Bosnia, even for the president's wife under the vigilant protection of the U.S. military. It took some guts for her to go. But I don't recall, and did not note, any close calls on this trip with sniper fire or any other dangers. \"\nImmediately after the speech that day, a reporter asked Clinton about remarks from others on the trip who suggested the trip was for photo opportunities rather than foreign policy and she stood by her account of sniper fire. \"There was no greeting ceremony, and we basically were told to run to our cars. Now, that is what happened,\" she said.\nBut she retracted the remarks a week later, telling the Philadelphia Daily News editorial board on March 24, 2008, that she \"misspoke,\" correcting herself to say she had been told there was a threat of sniper fire in the area. The next day she told reporters, \"So I made a mistake. That happens. It shows I'm human, which for some people is a revelation.\"\n\n"}

Democrats, who had led the effort to put HB 194 on next November's ballot as a referendum, said they were prepared to introduce election legislation that would lead to more voter participation and more ballots being counted.\n\nState Rep. Kathleen Clyde of Kent said at a news conference that the Democrats' measures would reduce the number of reasons for making voters cast provisional ballots, make election officials and not voters responsible for mistakes with ballots and require provisional ballots to be counted unless there was clear evidence of wrongdoing.\n\n\"Ohio has one of the highest provisional ballot rates in the country, and many of them go uncounted each election,\" she said.\n\nProvisional ballots are used when there is a question about a voter's eligibility at the polling station. That could include not having the documentation to verify their identity as a registered voter or a question about whether they voted absentee. Poll workers allow the person to vote with a provisional ballot until the problem is sorted out, and if the person is an eligible voter, then the ballot is counted.\n\nPolitiFact Ohio decided to check to see if Ohio was really among the national leaders.\n\nWe asked Rep. Clyde for her numbers and source.\n\n\"Ohio had 204,651 provisional ballots in 2008, the last presidential election year,\" she responded via email. Of that total, \"roughly 40,000 were not counted. Forty-thousand is indeed many.\"\n\nClyde said her numbers came from the Election Day Survey Report of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. We checked the report. It said that three states \u2014\nCalifornia, New York, and Ohio \u2014 reported the highest numbers of provisional ballots\ncast, accounting for 59.4 percent of the nation\u2019s total.\n\nPolitiFact Ohio found that the numbers also coincided with a \u00a0report on provisional voting by the nonpartisan Pew Center on the States.\n\nWe also looked at the commission\u2019s report for the 2010 midterm election. That year, too, it said, California and Ohio were the states with the largest number of provisional ballots, accounting for almost two-thirds of all provisional ballots cast nationwide. In Ohio there were 105,015 provisional ballots cast and 11,753 -- or more than 10 percent -- were rejected.\n\nClyde\u2019s claim had two components.\n\nThe first part was that \"Ohio has one of the highest provisional ballot rates in the country.\" Data from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission and from the Pew Center on the States backs that claim. Ohio was among the leaders for number of provisional ballots for both the 2008 and 2010 general elections.\n\nThe second part of her claim was that \"many of them go uncounted each election.\"\n\nHow many is many? We think tens of thousands of ballots can be classified as \"many.\"\n\nIn 2008, nearly 40,000 provisional ballots, just under 20 percent, were rejected in Ohio.\n\nIn the 2010 election, More than 11,000, slightly more than 11 percent, were rejected. Only three states rejected more ballots. Among states larger than Ohio, Texas, New York, Florida and Pennsylvania all had fewer provisional ballots and fewer rejections.\n\n"}

Richard Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told a group of constituents at a meeting in Youngsville, N.C., that North Korea\u2019s latest actions were \"something to really be concerned about.\"\nBurr went on to explain two reasons for his warning. One, he said, is that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un might be crazy. The other, he said, is that Kim has significantly ramped up missile development and testing since taking over for his father, the late Kim Jong-il.\n\"When you do things like he does, you automatically assume he\u2019s crazy,\" Burr said of Kim Jong Un. \"The pace of missile development between his father\u2019s term and his term has increased the testing about twenty-fold.\"\nThere has been plenty of bluster and confusion surrounding the country\u2019s missile launch lately \u2013 including the launch itself, a pre-launch parade replete with new military technology, and the Trump administration saying it had sent an aircraft carrier strike force to the area when, in reality, the ships were thousands of miles away and sailing in the opposite direction.\nSo in the midst of so much noise, we wanted to know if Burr was right.\nSpecifically, we looked into his claim that \"the pace of missile development between (Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un) has increased the testing about twenty-fold.\"\nA tiny but well-armed country\nIn terms of troops, North Korea has one of the world\u2019s largest militaries, along with the United States (a major adversary), China (its biggest ally) and India.\nKim Jong Il wasn\u2019t hesitant to build and test missiles, much to the dismay of neighboring countries. So increasing missile activity by a factor of 20 would require serious commitment by the younger Kim.\nBurr\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond when we asked where he got his information. He is, of course, privy to all sorts of secret reports and briefings we don\u2019t have at our own disposal. He\u2019s the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which oversees the 17 U.S. spy agencies.\nBut we don\u2019t think he would have unveiled classified information. And from the information that is public, it appears Burr is more or less correct.\nMissile testing and development\nWe interviewed multiple North Korea experts, none of whom said they could verify the numerical accuracy of Burr\u2019s claim \u2013 especially as it relates to missile development. Missile tests can be counted, but it\u2019s harder to quantify the speed at which new technologies are being developed and perfected.\n\"Perhaps saying the \u2018pace of missile development\u2019 is not quite accurate wording, but the pace of testing has indeed been unprecedented under Kim Jong Un,\" said Jean H. Lee.\nLee is a former journalist who covered North Korea and now works for the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. She said even failed tests are worrisome because North Korea is trying to create a nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile that could hit the United States.\n\n"}

He\u2019s revived the talking point in the weeks since the Nov. 3 election, which he lost to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden.\nIn this case, he has a point that the federal form that registers someone to vote doesn\u2019t require documentation to show proof of citizenship. But Trump left out the efforts by many states to cross-check their records with available data to avoid this problem.\u00a0\nLofty penalties for lying\nPeople who wish to register to vote must attest under penalty of perjury that they are citizens and eligible to vote, according to federal law.\nBoth the federal registration form and state versions warn that making false statements is a crime and that noncitizens should not fill out the form.\nThe consequences for noncitizens registering or voting include deportation, incarceration or fines. Noncitizens risk that a government official will check their voting record during a background check if they apply for naturalization.\u00a0\n\"So anyone who\u2019s not a citizen, and lies, is setting themselves up not only for future prosecution, but tanking their ability to become a citizen some day,\" said Loyola Law School professor Justin Levitt.\nIn an Arizona voting case, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that states are obligated to permit registration for federal elections using the federal form, which does not require documentary proof of citizenship. States may have their own form, but they must be willing to accept the federal form. Trump\u2019s spokesperson didn\u2019t respond to our request for evidence, but he specified \"federal elections\" in his statement.\nDatabases and driver\u2019s licenses: How states limit noncitizen voting\nIt\u2019s not apparent from Trump\u2019s claim, but many states have tried various means of confirming the citizenship status of voters. These methods have not been foolproof and have led to some errors and legal fights.\u00a0\nSome states have permission to use a federal resource of data, called the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, for the purposes of verifying that voter registration applicants are citizens. Implemented in 1987 and administered by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, SAVE was originally intended to verify eligibility for government benefits, such as Medicaid. SAVE , is not a database of people who are U.S. citizens, but it will show a person\u2019s immigration or citizenship status.\nArizona and Colorado election officials told us that they use SAVE. Florida tried, but it did not go well.\nFlorida election officials briefly used SAVE in 2012 as part of a voter purge effort, but it wrongly flagged many voters including a Brooklyn-born World War II veteran.

PolitiFact Tennessee addressed an associated claim in July when GOP state Senate candidate Woody Degan of Shelby County charged the Haslam administration was \"making our Economic Development Department Sharia compliant,\" in part by hiring Ali as international director earlier this year. The governor and the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development (ECD) rejected the contention that Ali or the department was doing anything relating to Sharia. We gave it our Pants On Fire ruling as not just false, but ridiculous.\n\nAt its simplest, Sharia law is the moral code and religious law of the Islamic faith, addressing a variety of personal and secular topics. Aspects of Sharia law do govern business dealings, and some Muslims conduct business only under Sharia-compliant conditions. For example, Sharia may prohibit interest on loans, considering it usury, but may allow other lending fees in lieu of interest. But most people, constitutional scholars and others, agree that attempting to install Sharia as U.S. or Tennessee law would be unconstitutional and there\u2019s been no bills at the state level to attempt it.\n\nThe voters of Senate District 32 gave Degan a drubbing. He got 10 percent of the vote against state Sen Mark Norris, R-Collierville, in their Aug. 2 primary. Despite that, the shadowy movement that Degan connected with during his campaign has not been deterred.\n\nIn addition to billhislam.com, there\u2019s another anonymous blog calling itself the \"tn Council 4 political justice,\" \u00a0which has posted 39 \"newsletters\" on its site since April 9, focused on the purported threat of Islam on Tennessee and the Haslam administration\u2019s role in it. The latest of these, posted Aug. 23, attempts to link Samar Ali\u2019s father, noted Waverly, Tenn., physician Subhi Ali, to The Jerusalem Fund. The anonymous bloggers write that the Washington, D.C.-based humanitarian non-profit\u2019s policies \"reflect overtly pro-Palestinian/pro-Hamas/anti-Israel positions.\" The bloggers also claim that \"in addition to making grants for social services in the \u2018Occupied Palestinian Territories,\u2019\" a branch of the Fund also \"supports the Palestine Diabetes Institute\" and that Samar Ali served as the transatlantic liaison during the development of that project.\n\nFrom diabetes to terrorism?\n\nThose behind billhislam.com make that leap: they titled their Aug. 23 link to the tn Council 4 political justice \"newsletter\" on Dr. Ali and the Jerusalem Fund as \"Dr. Jihad.\" They go even further, with one post trying to connect the dots between \"Sharia compliant finance investments\" that the Haslam administration strongly denies going after to the potential maiming of American soldiers in Afghanistan. Dave Vance of Big Rock, Tenn., writes on billhislam.com that \"Apparently, Governor Haslam is comfortable with the distinct possibility ... that at least some of the SCF (Sharia compliant finance) investments on which he intends to spend taxpayer funds will go to provide funds to the very people who are killing American troops in Afghanistan.\"\n\nIt would be one thing if all this had stayed buried in the cyber netherworld but it worked its way into Degan\u2019s campaigns and aforementioned resolutions passed by a few county GOP organizations (notably including the state\u2019s most affluent county, Williamson). Even the governor feels compelled to spend time addressing it occasionally. Last week, his top assistant, Deputy to the Governor Claude Ramsey, wrote the chairman of the Tennessee Republican Party, Chris Devaney, a letter disputing the allegations so Devaney could assure the GOP faithful that their standard-bearer is not a radical Islamist.\n\nWe will note that Haslam is an elder at Knoxville\u2019s Cedar Springs Presbyterian Church, a congregation of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church.\n\nThe blog and the website cite voluminous \"research\" in \"connecting the dots,\" as one section of billhislam.com is labeled.

The GOP-controlled House drew new political maps earlier this year that put Armstrong in a district with a Republican incumbent, Del.

For more than a year, Armstrong has been calling for tougher regulation of Apco and accusing the utility of bilking customers during hard times.

But Armstrong\u2019s use of the figures to prove record profits is misleading. The numbers are Apco\u2019s gross revenues; they don\u2019t include data that also show significant increases in the utility\u2019s operating costs over the same three years.\n\n2. \"Appalachian Power reported $136.7 million in net income for fiscal year 2010 -- a $13.8 million, or 11.2 percent increase from 2008.\"\n\nNet income -- revenues minus expenses and losses -- is often used as a term for profit. Armstrong\u2019s figures, while correct, do not prove Apco made record profits.\n\nWe reviewed annual reports going back to 1998 and found Apco\u2019s high-water mark for profits came in 2003, when it reported net income of $280 million, followed by 2002 when the company posted a $205 million gain.\n\nApco\u2019s average annual net income for the past 13 years is $143.4 million -- higher than the $136.7 million reported in 2010, the latest figure available. Apco\u2019s average net income over the last four years -- when, as Armstrong notes in ads, the utility has been granted nine rate increases -- \u00a0is $117.5 million, well below the utility\u2019s 13-year average.\n\n3. \"Appalachian Power is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEP, which reported $14.4 billion in total revenues and $1.2 billion in net income for fiscal year 2010.\n\nAmerican Electric Power has reported record net income over the last three years, although the $1.2 billion in 2010 was down from almost $1.4 billion nets the parent corporation reaped in 2008 and 2009.\n\nApco -- \u00a0which serves about 1 million customers in Southside and Southwest Virginia, as well as West Virginia and a small portion of Tennessee -- is one of six power companies owned by AEP. Although each entity keep its own books, there\u2019s no doubt money flows through the corporate chain. Apco, for example, does not generate enough of its own power to meet demand and is required to buy electricity from other AEP companies. Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli has questioned whether the purchases amount to profits for other AEP entities.\n\nBut Virginia regulators do not review the profits of the parent corporation or other subsidiaries when considering Apco\u2019s requests for rate hikes. \"We look at the entity that serves Virginia, and that\u2019s Appalachian Power,\" said Andy Farmer, a spokesman for the State Corporation Commission.\n\nApco\u2019s rates remained stable for decades, fueled by inexpensive coal burned in power plants in Ohio and West Virginia. But federal environmental regulations have tightened, forcing the company to spend $2 billion over the past five years to upgrade pollution controls. That, combined with a rise in the price of coal, has led to a 66 percent increase in Apco electric bills over the past six years.\n\nTwo major bond rating agencies -- Moody\u2019s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings -- put Apco\u2019s credit on watch for a possible downgrade in 2008, saying the utility\u2019s debt was rising faster than its cash flow. Fitch said Apco\u2019s performance as an investment depended on the outcome of its rate increase requests.\n\nApco\u2019s credit stabilized in 2009 after receiving a $450 million infusion from its parent, AEP.\n\nApco\u2019s 5.45 percent return on equity between from 2008 to 2010 fell well short of the 10.53 percent the SCC has been willing to allow in setting Apco\u2019s rates.\n\nThis fall, the utility has four requests pending before the SCC that would hike residential electric bills by a total of 11 percent -- to about $105.09 a month for 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity. The company is seeking an 11.15 percent return on equity.\n\nThe SCC staff has recommended a base rate hike that would produce about half of the $68.5 million in new\u00a0 revenue Apco is requesting. Cuccinelli\u2019s office has urged no base rate increase, saying Apco has room to lower its costs.\n\nBy comparison, Dominion, Virginia\u2019s largest electric utility, has a residential rate of $112.31 per kilowatt hour. Dominion is allowed an 11.9 percent return on equity.\n\nOur ruling:\n\nArmstrong has charged in ads that Apco, which has raised rates nine time during the last four years, is making record profits. \u00a0\n\nArmstrong tries to support his statement on three legs but we find fault with each. His citing of Apco\u2019s gross revenue is meaningless because they are not profits; his argument that Apco\u2019s net income increased by 11.2 percent between 2008 and 2010 is misleading because profits in those years were less than half of the record set in 2003; and his emphasis on the record profits of corporate parent AEP is irrelevant because state regulators, in setting rates, focus only on Apco\u2019s performance.\n\nArmstrong, a lawyer, has been poring over Apco\u2019s finances for more than a year and it\u2019s mind-boggling to suppose he's in the dark on these things"}

At a January gun expo in Las Vegas, Nugent described Obama as \"a communist-raised, communist-educated, communist-nurtured, subhuman mongrel.\"\nNugent now is campaigning with Texas Republican gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott. This led CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer to question whether the Abbott campaign understands the history of such language. (Abbott has not distanced himself from Nugent.)\n\"That\u2019s what the Nazis called Jews to justify the genocide of the Jewish community,\" Blitzer said in a Feb. 18, 2014, interview. \"They called them untermenschen, subhuman mongrels. If you read some of the literature that the Nazis put out there, there is a long history of that specific phrase he used involving the president of the United States.\"\nBlitzer\u2019s interview made waves through the political world, so we wanted to check his assertion about the words \"subhuman mongrel.\"\nIn his CNN interview, Blitzer cited the work of Nazi party official Julius Streicher. But our research shows Blitzer is correct well beyond an individual Nazi party official. The words subhuman and mongrel were used interchangeably but generally had the same derogatory meaning.\u00a0\nDavid Myers, a historian at the University of California at Los Angeles, said Adolph Hitler used the word \"untermensch\" or subhuman in his book Mein Kampf in 1925.\n\"From that point forward, it was part of the Nazi lexicon,\" Myers said. \"That and \u2018mischling\u2019 or mongrel, were intoned with daily regularity by the Nazi propaganda machine.\"\nThe man Blitzer mentioned, Streicher, was an early Nazi party leader in Nuremberg and Franconia and a fierce anti-Semite. In the mid 1920s, he began publishing a tabloid aimed at the working class called Der Sturmer, \"The Attacker.\" The front of each edition carried the slogan, \"The Jews are our misfortune.\"\nIn 1935, Der Sturmer carried a student essay that parrotted the teaching materials in the classroom.

Not really.\nCruz, who once had a warm relationship with Trump, has been increasingly taking jabs at him, ever since Trump attacked him for possibly not qualifying for the presidency (due to his birth in Canada) and for saying things like, \"Ted is a nasty guy. People don't like him.\" (Cruz\u2019s staff did not respond to an inquiry.)\nOne attack line Cruz has used that might be considered a personal insult is that Trump embodies \"New York values.\"\nDuring a previous GOP debate in North Charleston, S.C., moderator Maria Bartiromo pressed Cruz on his use of that line. The Texas senator doubled down. \"You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are,\" Cruz said.\n\"I am from New York,\" Bartiromo said. \"I don't.\"\nCruz responded, \"What? You're from New York? So you might not. But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.\"\nLater in the debate, Trump parried Cruz\u2019s attack by citing the city\u2019s response to the 9/11 attacks as examples of \"New York values.\" Trump received plaudits from many observers for his counter-shot, but that didn\u2019t stop Cruz from later releasing a television ad with the closing line, \"Donald Trump: New York values. Not ours.\"\nAnother example of a Cruz swipe at Trump: After Trump pulled out of the Des Moines debate, saying that Fox moderator Megyn Kelly was biased against him, Cruz mockingly referred to the businessman as \"gentle Donald\" at a West Des Moines event.\n\n"}

Elizabeth Warren emphasized a striking figure.\n\"If we make no changes over the next 10 years, Americans will reach into their pockets and pay out about $11 trillion on insurance premiums, copays, deductibles and uncovered medical expenses,\" the Democratic presidential candidate said in an Instagram video posted Nov. 4.\nThe Democratic health care debate has been full of competing analyses and estimates about what Medicare for All might cost, what it might save and who would bear the brunt of paying for it. But this precise number was new to us.\nIf true, it would be a figure both staggering and significant to the unfolding debate, as Americans try to understand how Warren\u2019s brand of a single-payer health system could affect their pocketbooks. So we decided to dig in.\nA reasonable estimate\nWe contacted the Warren campaign, which redirected us to a report from the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank, as well as to federal estimates of household out-of-pocket expenses and premium costs over the next decade.\nThe Urban report doesn\u2019t include the $11 trillion figure. But economist Linda Blumberg, who authored the paper, told us the statistic is \"perfectly consistent\" with the analysis.\nIf anything, she said, the number is a lowball figure.\u00a0When Blumberg and her team crunched the numbers, they found that, under the existing health care system, Americans can expect to pay $11.7 trillion between out-of-pocket costs \u2013 the copays, deductibles and uncovered medical expenses \u2013 and premiums over the next decade. That calculation comes from Urban\u2019s model for projecting what individual households might expect to spend, factoring in inflation, on these types of health costs.\n\"Talking about the amount of money we expect households to be spending over time is a very important part of trying to educate people on what single-payer would do, and what the tradeoffs are for them,\" said Blumberg, who previously advised the Clinton White House on health policy. On the numbers, \"they\u2019re roughly in the right neighborhood,\" she added.\nWe consulted other analysts, too, and as far as we can tell, no one else has done a similar calculation.\nExperts told us that Urban\u2019s estimate \u2014 and the Warren campaign\u2019s use of it \u2014 checks out, based on what we know about American health care spending.\nCynthia Cox, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation and expert on the Affordable Care Act, pointed to what a typical American family currently spends on health care: about $5,000 per year, when you look at out-of-pocket costs and premiums combined. Extrapolating from there, she said, Warren\u2019s claim seems reasonable. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\n\"Over the course of 10 years, when you add it up \u2014 that sounds about right,\" Cox said. \"The reality is, people do spend a lot on health care out of their pockets, and there\u2019s a lot spent on their behalf by employers or taxpayer-funded programs that they never see.\"\nUnder Warren\u2019s health care plan, Americans would pay nothing directly out-of-pocket \u2014 no premiums, copays or deductibles \u2014 for health care. So that $11 trillion would disappear from the cost side of the ledger.\n\n"}

Alan Grayson, D-Orlando, is perhaps most famous for his colorful language about Republicans, in his campaign for U.S. Senate he wants to portray himself as a politician who gets things done -- even when Republicans are in charge of Congress.\nOn July 9, Grayson announced that he will take on fellow Democratic U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy of Jupiter for the seat being vacated by\u00a0U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio. Grayson repeatedly made claims that he is No. 1 in terms of legislation passed:\n\"In the past two years in Congress, I\u2019ve written more bills, passed more amendments on the floor of the House and enacted more of my bills into law than any other member of the House -- No. 1 out of 435 of us,\" Grayson said in an announcement video on senatorwithguts.com.\nIs Grayson No. 1 in introducing bills as well as passing bills and amendments?\nIntroducing bills\nThis part of Grayson\u2019s claim is straightforward: For the most recent, Congress he holds the record for introducing bills.\nGovTrack, a website which tracks legislation, found that Grayson introduced 96 bills and resolutions during the 113th Congress, a two-year term which ended in January. That placed him at the No. 1 spot.\nBut how many passed? That might sound straightforward, but it isn\u2019t.\nPassing bills\nAs we have noted before, the number of bills sponsored by a member doesn\u2019t tell the full story about any member\u2019s legislative accomplishments. They can also influence legislation in other ways, such as writing language that gets included in a separate bill, co-sponsoring bills, holding hearings and negotiating agreements.\nOne way to count how many bills a member passed is to look at the number of bills he sponsored and how many of those actual bills were signed into law.\nUsing that method, GovTrack found that zero of Grayson\u2019s bills became law during the 113th Congress.\nBut Grayson counts bills that he sponsored in which the same language was included in separate versions.\nUsing the Congress.gov website, Grayson campaign spokesman Kevin Franck, pointed to 281 pieces of legislation that passed during the 113th Congress. The website showed that Grayson sponsored 10, more than anyone else. But none of those 10 were the actual ones that passed -- instead, other versions passed.\nAnd nine of those were ultimately lumped into one bill to amend the IRS tax code to extend tax credits -- for example for energy efficient homes -- or a deduction. The House passed H.R. 5771 378-46 in December 2014.\n\"My hunch is that these provisions would have made their way into the tax extender bill even without Rep. Grayson's bills,\" George Washington University professor Sarah Binder said. \u00a0\nThe only bill that didn\u2019t fall into that category was to prohibit an increase in the number of the military's flag and general officers -- the version that passed the House passed 376-5. (Grayson\u2019s staff found two additional bills he passed that didn\u2019t show up in that list of 10 that were lumped into a defense bill at the end of the year.)\n\n"}

{"label": "true", "claim": "Ron Wyden \"Oregon schools receive millions of dollars per year in federal school lunch assistance and yet they are required to spend that money almost anywhere but Oregon.\"", "evidence": "When the Senate was debating the farm bill recently, Sen. Ron Wyden highlighted the haphazard nature of the way food is purchased and provided to the school lunch program under a program known as USDA Foods.\n\nHis point was simple: A lot of the food from one program in particular that ends up in school kitchens comes from points far away from the schools serving it. Using local sources of food might be cheaper, he argued, and it certainly would be more nutritious.\n\nWyden offered an amendment that would establish pilot programs at five locations nationwide to see if using local food could be both cheaper and better. Wyden\u2019s amendment, which passed the Senate, would give school officials in five \"pilot\" areas far more flexibility in deciding where they purchase food.\n\nRight now, schools that agree to take part in the program, USDA Foods, are locked into a system that almost always forces them to purchase food from outside Oregon. That program is small, supplying only 20 percent of the food used in school nutrition programs but Wyden said the $11 million a year spent on it for Oregon schools should be used for food produced in Oregon.\n\nSo he offered an amendment for give states and local districts more flexibility in navigating the USDA Foods system. The program offers a list of mostly bulk items that states purchase and then supply to local districts.\n\nAccording to a USDA description, \"Schools are ordering more bulk products that can be processed into kid-friendly items. \u2026 Decisions about what products schools order are not based just on the item\u2019s popularity but on its overall usefulness in meeting nutritional standards.\"\n\nWyden\u2019s amendment would allow local officials, working in collaboration with state purchasing agents, more flexibility in where they can buy the food to overcome a system that brings most of the food to Oregon from other states.\n\nWhile small and limited, Wyden said it\u2019s important nonetheless and changing the program would bring extra dollars to the local economy while also providing more nutritious food.\n\nAfter it passed, the Oregon Democrat drove home the point in a news release: \"Oregon schools receive millions of dollars per year in federal school lunch assistance and yet they are required to spend that money almost anywhere but Oregon.\"\n\nThat is the kind of statement PolitiFact Oregon can really chew on.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that the federal government spends \"millions of dollars\" to pay for school meals in Oregon. That part of Wyden\u2019s statement isn\u2019t in doubt.\n\nBut the second part made us wonder. Is it really true that most of the food purchased for Oregon schools under USDA Foods ended up with food from \"almost anywhere but Oregon?\"\n\nTo answer, you have to dive into federal rules governing USDA Foods and some of the department\u2019s school food programs. It is a dense and complicated business that is as close as government gets to an extreme sport. Even the experts admit they don\u2019t always understand all the rules and requirements.\n\nHere's just one section:\n\n\"At the beginning of each school year, State agencies shall establish the per meal rates of reimbursement for school food authorities participating in the Program. These rates of reimbursement may be assigned at levels based on financial need; except that, the rates are not to exceed the maximum rates of reimbursement established by the Secretary under \u00a7210.4(b) and are to permit reimbursement for the total number of lunches in the State from funds available under \u00a7210.4. Within each school food authority, the State agency shall assign the same rate of reimbursement from general cash assistance funds for all lunches served to children under the Program.\"\n\nHad enough? There\u2019s plenty more, but we\u2019ll spare you. The regulations run 65 pages.\n\nWyden\u2019s spokeswoman Jennifer Hoelzer admitted her boss\u2019s statement was based on piles of \"anecdotal evidence\" derived from talks with school officials as well as those at the Agriculture Department because detailed records are hard to find.\n\nBut we found some.\n\nThe best is a spreadsheet compiled by David Jones at the Oregon Department of Education that was also shared with Wyden. It reveals that only seven food purchases out of 166 during the 2011-12 school year came from Oregon from the USDA Foods program. That\u2019s 4 percent for those of you who need help with the math.\n\nCheese came from Missouri and Minnesota as well as other states. Oregon schools used meatless spaghetti sauce bought in Indiana, applesauce from Michigan and peanut butter from New Mexico. And then there was California, a true category killer that supplied Oregon schools with everything from peaches to salsa to something called \"Burrito, Beef & Bean Bulk\" and frozen strawberries.\n\nForget Oregon cheese and strawberries, foodies. The only products bought from Oregon vendors were green beans, chicken fajita strips and frozen potato rounds.\n\nAre the schools \"required\" to buy out-of-state food if they choose to take part in USDA Foods?\n\nNo. USDA Foods is voluntary. But most schools take part which means, as a practical matter, the answer is yes. Schools that take federal money for the nutrition must purchase their food through the USDA\u2019s program. And the rules governing the program almost guarantee the sale will be made out of state.\n\nSo we conclude with records that all point in the same direction. Following federal procurement rules, which schools have to do to get federal money, leaves them little choice about what to buy and where to buy it, at least for USDA Foods.\n\nIt\u2019s unknown whether the portion of out-of-state food is similarly lopsided for the entire school nutrition effort in Oregon. But for USDA Foods, the one definitive document we found shows unambiguous results -- 96 percent of food served in Oregon schools and purchased with federal dollars came from another state"}

Jim Dunnam \"has not lived in the district he represents for years now.\" The party chairman, Steve Munisteri, had earlier levelled the same charge in a Waco press conference.\n\nWe wondered what was what, and where.\n\nSome background: Article 3 of the Texas Constitution says House members must be Texas residents for two years and, before their election, must have lived for at least a year in the district they would represent. A similar one-year provision applies to Senate candidates, though they must have lived in Texas for five years; that hurdle has been in the news in connection with Republican Brian Birdwell\u2019s eligibility to fill the Texas Senate seat he recently won in a special election. Birdwell has acknowledged voting for president in Virginia in 2004.\n\nDunnam\u2019s legal residency has been challenged before. After the 2002 elections, Dunnam was sued by his defeated GOP foe, who said the legislator, his wife and children had lived since 1998 near McGregor (a Waco suburb) in a house no longer in the district Dunnam represents.\n\nDunnam\u2019s house was cut out of his district when a state board redrew districts in 2001, according an Associated Press report from the time. The story quotes Dunnam saying he\u2019d moved to a smaller house in his redrawn district (which he told us he later sold), but also kept the house near McGregor because he didn't want to uproot his kids from the Midway school district until absolutely necessary. The lawsuit was later dismissed by a judge.\n\nThis August, the Waco Tribune-Herald quoted Munisteri saying the party now plans no legal challenge to Dunnam\u2019s legal residency. The chairman said \"residency cases are extremely difficult to win\" because the state\u2019s standard for determining residency is based in part on a candidate\u2019s intended residence. \"You can be absent from a location for a significant period of time and still be determined to be in the district legally,\" Munisteri said. But \"there\u2019s a difference between legally being in the district and really in the district.\"\n\nThe Tribune-Herald and the Dallas Morning News subsequently quoted Dunnam saying he owns the house outside his district so his children can attend Midway schools--plus a rural home he considers his homestead in nearby Falls County, which is in Dunnam\u2019s district.\n\nDunnam told the Morning News that he votes in Chilton in Falls County where he and his wife built their house on 90 acres. Using Google Maps, we determined the Falls County home is about 20 miles south of Dunnam\u2019s house near McGregor.\n\nOn a website titled \"Done With Dunnam,\" the GOP presents two from-the-road photos of the Falls County house, both taken July 31, according to a notation. The GOP\u2019s caption: \"No activity in and out of house and no cars in the driveway.\"\n\nThe Republican Party also presents two photographs taken from the street of Dunnam\u2019s house near McGregor, one taken July 18 and the other July 31. In one photo, two of three cars are clearly visible; one has a \"state official\" license plate. The photos are captioned: \"Plenty of activity in and out of the house and cars bearing state official plates in the driveway.\"\n\nDunnam, objecting to the criticism, told the Morning News: \"My constituents have no issue with me and my roots. I've been there 46 years and was literally born in the district -- and my dad was too, and my kids were.\"\n\nSeparately, the Texas Tribune quoted Dunnam saying that since his homestead is in his district, Dunnam was confident he clears the constitution\u2019s residency hurdle. Falls County confirmed that Dunnam claims the house as his homestead. According to the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, one can do so if the home is their \"principal residence\" on Jan. 1 of the tax year.\n\nWe also checked the Midway district\u2019s residency requirement. Its website says that admission is free to students if they \"and either parent reside in the district.\" Generally, district spokeswoman Traci Marlin told us, students must live within the school district with a parent who has legal custody or a legal guardian. Marlin said for the purposes of enrolling a student, the district doesn\u2019t weigh whether their families take their homestead exemption on a house outside the district.\n\nSo, where does Dunnam actually live?\n\nWhen we initially put that question to the legislator, Dunnam said, \"I\u2019ll be in Houston tonight, I spent three nights in Austin last week ... I have a residence (the country place) and I spend time at various locations.\"\n\nHmmm. Is it reasonable to conclude that Dunnam lives apart from his wife and children in his homestead residence in Falls County? Or -- since the Midway district requires at least one parent or guardian of a child to live in the district and Dunnam and his wife appear to be an intact couple -- does it make more sense to conclude the family stays mostly at the house near McGregor?\n\nIn a follow-up interview, Dunnam said he lives in the Falls County house, which he\u2019d earlier said the couple completed about five years ago. \"I live in Chilton,\" Dunnam said. But \"I do spend time at my other house.\"\n\nDunnam said too that both he and his wife are registered to vote in Falls County and have driver\u2019s licenses with the Falls County address. And, he said, the Midway district has the Falls County address as his home address. We asked if he\u2019d provide us access to that record--which would confirm he\u2019s told the district he doesn\u2019t live at the home near McGregor. Dunnam said he\u2019d do so if we could assure him that would \"be dispositive\" -- ending our inquiry. We couldn\u2019t guarantee that.\n\nHe added: \"It is unreasonable for you to assume anything about my personal life because you don\u2019t know.\"\n\nTrue, and neither does the Republican Party. The party\u2019s statement hinges on what is meant by where someone \"lives.\" By a strict interpretation -- the one used by the GOP -- that would be where Dunnam stays most often. But determining that would take significant detective work, far more than a few photos.\n\nA broader interpretation would allow for the possibility Dunnam hasn\u2019t lived exclusively in his House district for years, but instead flits between -- and lives in -- both houses"}

They also aren\u2019t happy how Trump often spends his weekends away from the White House visiting one of his properties.\nSen.

Completely, gone,\" McCaskill said at an April 14, 2017, town hall.\u00a0\n\"If we are not doing meals on wheels, it is cutting off our nose to spite our face, because the people who can't get nutrition at home and don\u2019t stay well end up in a nursing home, and you end up paying the bill, so meals and wheels is a small investment,\" McCaskill said. \"If Donald Trump would stay home from Mar-a-Lago one weekend, if he would stay home from Mar-a-Lago for one weekend, it would pay the entire meals and wheels budget for the state of Missouri for almost two\u00a0years.

The question of this fact-check is: Would one fewer trip to Mar-a-Lago save Missouri's meals on wheels programs for two years?\nTrump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago trips\nPinning down the cost of a trip to Mar-a-Lago is difficult. As PolitiFact has previously reported, the closest thing we have is a 2016 Government Accountability Office report detailing the costs of a 2013 trip taken by President Barack Obama. The trip was four days from Chicago to Palm Beach, Fla., and cost $3.6 million.\nBut the author of that report has said it should not be used to estimate the cost of Trump\u2019s travel to Florida.\n\"We wouldn\u2019t recommend substituting the numbers from President Obama\u2019s trip to any other trip,\" Brian Lepore, director of defense capabilities and management at GAO, told PolitiFact in April. (We rated a fact-check saying Trump's trips cost $3.6 million Half True.)\nWhen the president travels, generally several military aircraft are involved. These include Air Force One, carrying the president, his entourage and guests, cargo planes packing motorcade limousines and other equipment, and aircraft to transport personnel who conduct security sweeps before the president arrives.\nThis is the main driver of presidential travel costs. Air Force One alone costs nearly $180,000 per hour of flight as of 2012, according to the Congressional Research Service. The GAO report found that total air and boat support accounted for more than 85 percent of the $3.6 million spent on Obama\u2019s 2013 trip.\nBut these costs change significantly from trip to trip, so it\u2019s hard to nail down the average cost.\n\n"}

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Jimmy Carter The number of African-American men in prison has increased fivefold since he left office.", "evidence": "Former President Jimmy Carter joined tens of thousands of Americans last week to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington and its leader, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\nCarter reflected on the progress America has made since 1963 to achieve King\u2019s dream of racial and economic equality. But Carter, a former Georgia governor, spoke about some issues he believes would pain King, a fellow Georgian. Carter said one trouble spot would be the number of African-American men in prison. Carter included some specifics that made us curious about whether they were accurate.\n\"I think we all know how Dr. King would have reacted to having more than 835,000 African-American men in prison, five times as many as when I left office,\" Carter told the massive crowd on the National Mall.\nCarter continued by saying about one-third of black men are \"destined to be in prison in their lifetimes,\" a statistic frequently cited in news reports. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the number of black men in prison had increased that much since Carter left the White House. We thought we\u2019d do some research, considering the speech was broadcast live and Carter\u2019s statistics have since been widely reported in various news outlets.\nWhen Carter left the White House in January 1981, the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics reported there were 160,442 black men in American prisons. That was nearly the same amount as the number of white men in prison (183,202), although at that time there were more than seven times as many white men as black men in the U.S.\nThe number of black men in the United States increased by more than 45 percent between 1980 and 2010, U.S. Census figures show, from 12.5 million to 18.2 million. Their incarceration rates have been a constant subject of consternation and conversation among many civil rights activists, conservatives and criminologists. One often-repeated claim is that there are more black men in prison than in college. The most recent statistics suggest that assertion is false.\nIvory Toldson, an associate professor at Howard University, talked about such claims earlier this year during an interview with NPR, citing numbers that support Carter\u2019s claim concerning how many African-American men are currently in prison.\nToldson pointed us to a table from a June 2010 U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics report that said about 841,000 African-American men were in prison or in jail in 2009.\nAn estimated 694,000 white men were in prison or jail that year. That is nearly four times the total number of white men in prison or jail \u00a0in 1981.\nCarter, too, based his claim on that report, said Steven Hochman, the director of research for the former president.\nCase closed?

Second of all, I think it would be very divisive. The real issue is when we look at the poverty rate among the African-American community, when we look at the high unemployment rate within the African-American community, we have a lot of work to do.\n\"So I think what we should be talking about is making massive investments in rebuilding our cities, in creating millions of decent paying jobs, in making public colleges and universities tuition-free, basically targeting our federal resources to the areas where it is needed the most, and where it is needed the most is in impoverished communities, often African-American and Latino.\"\nOn Meet the Press, Sanders pretty much dropped the pragmatism argument (though he pushed back on the notion that his economic proposals are politically impossible) and focused instead on the second part of his rationale about improving economic conditions and schools for minorities.\nSo how does this mirror, if at all, the approach by Obama and Clinton?\nObama\u2019s opposition\nIn 2007 and 2008, then-presidential candidate Obama voiced his opposition to reparations, arguing that the best way to amend for the past is to focus on the present and future.\n\"I think the reparations we need right here in South Carolina is investment, for example, in our schools,\" Obama said in a July 2007 CNN debate.\nObama couched his opposition somewhat differently in a 2007 NAACP presidential questionnaire.

(O\u2019Hanlon is one of hundreds of voluntary advisers to the Clinton campaign but has a minor role.)\nYou could say the blame touches both Bush, for creating a strong space for al-Qaida in Mesopotamia, and Obama, for giving the group a chance to regroup.\nAs for Clinton, Trump\u2019s campaign points to her vote as a senator to authorize force in Iraq in 2002. She later said she regretted that vote.\n\n"}
{"label": "half-true", "claim": "James Capretta Obamacare is a \"massive, massive income redistribution\" with \"$250 billion a year in Medicaid expansion (and) in the subsidy structure that's basically being paid for by people on Medicare, through Medicare cuts, and a lot of tax increases.\"", "evidence": "Conservatives have many reasons to dislike Obamacare but one of the most fundamental is, as with any government program, it interferes with private-sector decisions by collecting money from some people and spending it in ways that might not benefit them directly. This point came up on Fox News Sunday when host Chris Wallace asked if Obamacare involved massive income redistribution.\nOne of his guests, James Capretta with the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a group with ties to conservative organizations, agreed wholeheartedly.\n\"If you think about it, it's $250 billion a year in Medicaid expansion, in the subsidy structure, that's basically being paid for by people on Medicare, through Medicare cuts, and a lot of tax increases,\" Capretta said. \"It is a massive, massive income redistribution.\"\nIn this fact-check, we look at whether the new health care law is a \"massive, massive income redistribution\" that has taken $250 billion a year out of taxes and from people on Medicare and moved it into Medicaid expansion health care subsidies.\nCapretta told PunditFact that he drew his numbers from the entity that lays down the benchmark for all of these discussions, the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan analytic arm of Congress. In a May 2013 report, that office projected that in 2023, the Affordable Care Act would spend $250 billion specifically to offer Medicaid to a larger number of poor people and subsidies to make private insurance more affordable to people making up to 400 percent of federal poverty (about $92,000 a year for a family of four).\nCapretta argued that since the law reduces deficits, that $250 billion, and more, must come from somewhere and he correctly points to reductions in Medicare spending and a variety of tax increases.\nThe Obamacare balance sheet\nThe most detailed figures from the Congressional Budget Office are for 2022, not 2023, but the pattern remains the same.\nA quick reminder: The Medicare spending reductions we\u2019re talking about are not cuts in the sense that Medicare will spend less than it does today. The reductions are in the future growth of Medicare spending, not a cut in existing programs.\nThat said, on the government balance sheets, in 2022 the health care law \"saves\" $133 billion from Medicare, Medicare Advantage (an alternative insurance program within Medicare), and a program that pays hospitals that serve more than their fair share of poor, uninsured patients. Another $161 billion in new revenue is collected from five different sources.\nThat list includes penalties paid by individuals and employers for not buying or offering insurance, taxes on higher income earners (above $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for couples), a tax on the most generous insurance plans (the Cadillac tax), a tax on medical device and drug manufacturers, and a grab bag of other taxes.\nThat\u2019s a total of $294 billion.\nWhat does the government do with the money? As Capretta said, it spends most of it on an expansion of Medicaid and on subsidies for people purchasing health insurance through state and federal marketplaces. Around $45 billion goes toward deficit reduction.\nDoes that make Capretta right? John Holahan, a fellow at the Urban Institute, an academic research center in Washington, said yes and no.\n\"There\u2019s definitely redistribution going on,\" Holahan said. \"All the Medicaid and subsidies clearly go to lower income people. Where he\u2019s wrong is in calling it massive. It\u2019s very small.\"\nHolahan said relative to the size of the economy, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates at $21.7 trillion in 2022, the total redistribution amounts to about 1 percent, but even that, Holahan said, is \"a wild exaggeration.\"\nThe primary reason, he said, is that except for the new or increased taxes on wealthier Americans, it is difficult to know who are true losers in the new system. Insurance companies, for example, might pay more in taxes, but they also gain from the revenues they get from subsidized policies. And to one of Capretta\u2019s main points, it\u2019s equally unclear whether the Medicare savings come from people on Medicare.\n\n"}
{"label": "pants-fire", "claim": "Jeff Wentworth Says Donna Campbell is pushing a 35 percent sales tax extending to medicine, groceries and real estate.", "evidence": "State Sen. Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio says his opponent in a July 31, 2012, Republican primary runoff has a hankering to hike taxes.\n\nA Wentworth campaign mailer tells residents of the Austin-to-San Antonio Senate district: \"Don\u2019t be tricked: Donna Campbell,\" his New Braunfels runoff opponent, \"is pushing a 35% national-state-local sales tax on medicine, healthcare, groceries, water and real estate!\" Another Wentworth mailer presents her as saying: \"Texas needs a 35% sales tax on groceries, medicine, healthcare, water and ALL purchases.\" And a July 18, 2012, news article in the San Marcos Daily Record quotes Wentworth as saying: \"My opponent's call for a 35 percent sales tax in Texas on medicine, groceries, water, real estate and all purchases is absurd.\"\n\nA refresher: The existing state sales tax of 6.25 percent applies to retail sales, leases and rentals of most goods plus 17 categories of taxable services including Internet access and security services. Also, Texas cities, counties, transit authorities and special-purpose districts have the option of imposing an additional local sales tax for a combined total of state and local taxes of 8.25 percent. Many items -- including water, groceries and medicine -- are exempted from the sales tax.\n\nSo, Wentworth is saying that Campbell both wants to more than quintuple the state sales tax rate and start applying the tax to some essential items.\n\nOne hitch for us in starting this fact-check was the absence of any public sign that Campbell has been campaigning for a 35 percent state-federal-local sales tax. Any such proposal goes unmentioned on her campaign website, where she says she will work to decrease taxation.\n\nAsked how Wentworth unearthed his opponent\u2019s double-digit tax-hike push, Wentworth\u2019s consultant, Bryan Eppstein, pointed out that while Campbell was running for the U.S. House in 2010, Austin\u2019s KVUE-TV quoted her as advocating the replacement of federal income taxes with a 23 percent federal sales tax on consumer goods and services, a position then pointed out by her Democratic opponent, U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett.\n\nAn online version of the Oct. 29, 2010, KVUE news story quotes Campbell as saying: \"Income tax, payroll tax, you wouldn\u2019t pay any of that\" under the approach. \"If it\u2019s a retail tax, and you buy something new you\u2019d pay 23 percent,\" she said.\n\nEppstein further pointed out that an official with the right-leaning Texas Public Policy Foundation, Talmadge Heflin, testified afresh in May 2012 in favor of the state wiping out property taxes and making up the lost revenue with changes in the sales tax. He said that based on Heflin\u2019s testimony, Wentworth concluded that Campbell favors a state sales tax rate of 12 percent.\n\nHeflin, a former chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, hearkened in his testimony to an April 2009 foundation report stating that revenue generated by property taxes could be replaced by money raised from the sales tax by setting the rate at 12.5 percent if the existing tax is extended to property sales or, he said, 9 percent if the tax is extended to property sales as well as all services that are taxed in at least one other state. The report says that if the sales tax is not expanded to additional items or services, its rate would need to be around 14.5 percent to raise revenues lost by eliminating property taxes statewide.\n\nEppstein also noted that Campbell has the endorsement of Texans for Fiscal Responsibility, a group that asked candidates seeking its support to fill out its 2012 candidate questionnaire, including questions about phasing out property taxes in return for raising sales taxes.\n\nOne question on the survey refers to \"end-user consumption taxes,\" meaning sales taxes. The questions says: \"Would you support moving Texas away from property taxes in favor of the existing sales and use tax?\" Candidates are asked to support or oppose. The question is followed by this text: \"Note: Tax swaps, phase-outs or trade-offs are not considered tax increases unless the total tax burden is increased.\"\n\nNext on the questionnaire: \"Statement: Texas should phase out property taxes in favor of end-user consumption taxes.\" Candidates are asked to agree or disagree.\n\nBy email, Campbell spokesman Jon Oliver said that Campbell replied on the questionnaire that she supports moving Texas away from property taxes to the existing sales tax and also agreed that Texas should phase out property taxes in favor of end-user consumption taxes.\n\nBut, Oliver said, in order to have Campbell\u2019s support, a proposal to replace property taxes with sales taxes would have to lower the overall tax burden for Texas families and businesses; be limited to taxing items currently covered by the sales tax; be phased in gradually; and win voter approval at the polls.\n\nEarlier, Oliver said by email: \"She is intrigued by the overall idea of a consumption tax instead of a property tax if it would truly lower the tax burden, but it's not part of her platform and she certainly wouldn't support a state sales tax in the form Sen.Wentworth has claimed she would -- that is, taxing items that are currently exempt.\"\n\nOliver noted, too, that Campbell has signed three pledges disavowing higher taxes: the Americans for Prosperity Taxpayer Pledge in favor of requiring voter or legislative supermajority approval for tax and spending increases; Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s \"budget compact\" pledge to oppose any new taxes or tax increase; and one to taxpayers, advocated by Texans for Fiscal Responsibility, stating she \"will oppose and vote against any and all efforts to increase taxes.\"\n\nWe circled back to Eppstein, asking for evidence of Campbell talking up a 35-percent sales tax. By telephone, Eppstein said he has heard Campbell indicate as much, but did not record it.\n\nOur ruling\n\nWentworth says Campbell is pushing a 35 percent sales tax extending to medicine, groceries and real estate. She\u2019s not, though we can see the threads behind this misleading claim.\n\nWhile running for Congress in 2010, Campbell \u00a0spoke out in favor of a possible 23 percent federal sales tax in return for wiping out federal income taxes. In the same spirit, she now supports replacing property tax revenue collected across Texas with income from the state sales tax. By itself, that move could drive the state sales tax rate to 14 percent or so. Then again, the conditions her campaign lays out could be taken as signals she\u2019s not ready to embrace any sudden surge or broadening of the tax.\n\nCampbell\u2019s two stances, taken years apart in campaigns for different offices, reflect on sales taxes at different levels of government.This claim distorts both positions by effectively combining the possible tax rates. All told, too, it\u2019s ridiculous to assert that Campbell, who has signed no-new-tax pledges, is pushing or calling for an expanded sales tax set at 35 percent.\n\nPants on Fire!\n\n"}

While terrorists infiltrate and attack with our safety at risk, Jon Ossoff is just too risky.\"\nJust in case you didn\u2019t get the point, the ad uses lots of not-very-subtle footage of facemask-wearing terrorists, burning American flags and the like.\nWe\u2019ve checked some portions of this narration previously -- the part about the FBI warnings on screenings got a Half True, for instance, and the part about the Iran nuclear deal funding terrorism also got a Half True.\nHere, we\u2019ll look at the opening line -- that \"ISIS is infiltrating America and using Syrians to do it.\"\nWe found solid reasons to be dubious of this claim.\nWhat does \"infiltrate\" mean?\nThe ad contends, twice, that ISIS supporters are \"infiltrating\" the United States from Syria in order to commit terrorist acts.\nThe big problem with that claim: To date, there is not a single documented case of that happening. Nor are there any documented cases that come reasonably close to that description.\n\"There\u2019s no sliver of truth here,\" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism specialist at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. \"It\u2019s simply a false statement.\"\nThere is one area of the world where Syrian ISIS infiltration might be taking place. ISIS members posing as refugees from Syria can make their way to central and western Europe either over land or by boat from the Mediterranean.\nBut that\u2019s not the case for the United States, the locale that\u2019s clearly the subject of the NRCC ad.\nFor entering the United States, \"ISIS infiltration is not very efficient,\" Gartenstein-Ross said. It\u2019s not that the screening process is perfect, he said, but rather a question of math.\n\"The refugee-selection process is designed to select very few military-age, single males, and even if you fit the criteria, the odds are still not good that you\u2019ll get selected\" to go to the United States, he said. And before gaining entry to the United States, you are likely to have a long wait in a refugee camp. (We\u2019ve previously looked at the composition of refugees by age and sex here.)\nNRCC spokeswoman Maddie Anderson argued for the ad\u2019s accuracy by saying that in addition to physical infiltration, \"ISIS is also infiltrating us with their ideology by seeking to inspire lone wolf attacks here from afar. The domestic terrorists have gotten their ideas and been inspired by what\u2019s going on in the Middle East.\"\nWe have no objection to the argument that ISIS is inspiring lone-wolf terrorists -- the list below is chock full of examples. But the ad didn\u2019t urge efforts to combat ideological propaganda on social media. It used the phrase \"terrorists infiltrate\" and referred to Syrian refugee admissions -- of humans, not ideas. So the ad gives a very different impression than the one Anderson was arguing.\nThe closest examples don\u2019t involve Syrians\nThe rare instances in which an adult entered the United States and later went on to commit a terrorist act don\u2019t apply to what the ad said about Syrians.\nThe closest example might be the case of two Iraqi immigrants, Waad Ramadan Alwan and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, who were arrested in 2011 in a sting in Bowling Green, Ky.\nBefore coming to the United States, Alwan had made bombs that allegedly targeted American military personnel in Iraq. So he was a terrorist before coming to the United States, and he did enter -- \"infiltrate\" -- the country. But he came to the United States before ISIS existed, and before the beginning of the civil war that triggered an influx of displaced Syrians.\n\n"}

The article concerns Rubio\u2019s plan in general, but the pertinent part reads, \"Those in the top 0.1 percent, who make $3.3 million and up, would be in line for an average tax cut of $240,000 \u2014 a boost in after-tax income of 3.8 percent.\"\nIs $240,000 more than \"three times\" the earning power of a typical family?

PolitiFact Florida ruled the claim Half True because Crist doesn't tell voters that Rubio's plan wouldn't affect current retirees or people nearing the retirement age.\n\nRubio -- and even Meek -- are now piling on Crist for supporting what Rubio says amounts to amnesty for illegal immigrants in order to fund Social Security beyond 2037.\n\nSocial Security was the first major policy issue discussed in the trio's past two debates, Oct. 6, 2010, with ABC News and on Fox on Oct. 15. Here's how Crist described his plan during the ABC News debate.\n\n\"I think it's important that we realize where Social Security is today. And let's have a mature discussion about it,\" Crist said. \"Report after report says that it's solvent until 2037 or 2041. I'm an optimist. I'm hopeful that the economy will continue to improve. But I've also offered a plan that can help it that's supported by Robert Reich, secretary of labor-- previously, in a previous administration. And it's straightforward and simple.\n\n\"There are 11 (million) to 14 million people, different estimates by different people, that are not American citizens today -- not participating in the American economy,\" Crist said. \"If we can find a pathway to earn citizenship for those 11 to 14 million people, they would be paying into the system. And when 2037 or 2041 comes, if in fact Social Security is still being challenged, we have another way and an opportunity to pay for it that provides jobs in a legal sense, and is compassionate to immigrants who come to our country.\"\n\nMeek called Crist's idea \"bizarre,\" and Rubio said it's akin to amnesty. (For the record, Crist does talk about earned citizenship).\n\nIn this fact check we're focusing on Crist's plan for Social Security and ultimately whether Reich, President Bill Clinton's labor secretary, can be counted among its supporters.\n\nSocial Security is always a big issue in Florida. According to the U.S. Social Security Administration, more than 3.5 million Floridians receive Social Security benefits. Typically, you need to work in order to be eligible for Social Security and benefits are based on what you earned. The program is funded by payroll taxes.\n\nIn 2010, for the first time, Social Security will pay out more in benefits than it takes in. The deficit, approximately $41 billion, will be offset by money in the Social Security trust fund. By 2014, as the baby boomer generation retires, deficits are expected to increase, according to the Social Security and Medicare Boards of Trustees. By 2037, the trust fund will be empty, trustees predict, and incoming taxes will only be able to pay out 75 percent of scheduled benefits through 2084.\n\nSo something needs to change between now and 2037 -- whether it's raising the retirement age, altering benefits, or something else -- to keep Social Security solvent.\n\nCrist says he thinks one way to keep Social Security solvent is by having people currently working in the country illegally earn citizenship and pay payroll taxes, which in turn would fund future Social Security benefits.\n\nAnd Reich, who now teaches at the University of California at Berkeley, also pointed to immigration as a way to solve problems funding Social Security. He wrote a blog for the Christian Science Monitor in April 2010 entitled \"Immigration: Could it solve Social Security, Medicare woes?\"\n\n\"The biggest reason Social Security is in trouble, and Medicare as well, is because America is aging so fast,\" Reich wrote. \"It's not just that so many boomers are retiring. It\u2019s also that seniors are living longer. And families are having fewer children. Add it all up and the number of people who are working relative to the number who are retired keeps shrinking.\n\n\"Forty years ago there were five workers for every retiree. Now there are three. Within a couple of decades, there will be only two workers per retiree. There's no way just two workers will be able or willing to pay enough payroll taxes to keep benefits flowing to every retiree.\n\n\"This is where immigration comes in. Most immigrants are young because the impoverished countries they come from are demographically the opposite of rich countries. Rather than aging populations, their populations are bursting with young people. Yes, I know: There aren't enough jobs right now even for Americans who want and need them. But once the American economy recovers, there will be. Take a long-term view and most new immigrants to the U.S. will be working for many decades.\n\n\"Get it? One logical way to deal with the crisis of funding Social Security and Medicare is to have more workers per retiree, and the simplest way to do that is to allow more immigrants into the United States.\"\n\nUnlike Crist, Reich's comments do not address illegal workers. Rather, his point is to allow more people to legally immigrate to the United States. That's different from what Crist is saying.\n\nIn fact it turns out Social Security already is receiving a huge benefit from illegal workers who are paying into the system but as of now are unable to receive any of the benefits. Back in 2005, the New York Times reported that illegal workers essentially are contributing a $6 billion to $7 billion annual subsidy. More recent estimates suggest illegal workers are now paying $9 billion to $12 billion a year into Social Security, with no legal way to get that money back in retirement benefits.\n\nSome illegal workers are paid under the table in cash, meaning there is no record that they're working, and of course, no taxes for the federal government to extract. But many more purchase fake IDs and get fake Social Security cards in order to work, on the surface, legally.\n\nWhen those workers are paid, they still pay Social Security payroll taxes. But the federal government can't match those taxes up to a living, real person -- which is the way the government determines a worker's retirement benefit.\n\nSome of the Social Security discrepancies are clerical in nature and get fixed. But many of them are thanks to illegal workers submitting bogus Social Security information. The Social Security Administration estimates that two-thirds of illegal workers are paying Social Security payroll taxes.\n\nOver the life of Social Security, government actuary Stephen C. Goss said, illegal workers have contributed between $120 billion and $240 billion.\n\nThat's money that is helping keep Social Security afloat for current and future beneficiaries.\n\nCrist's plan would potentially tap the other third of illegal workers not paying payroll taxes, but also would allow all workers access to Social Security benefits when they reach retirement age. Added benefits, yes. But added costs, too.\n\nNeedless to say, that wasn't what Reich was even talking about in his blog for the Christian Science Monitor. \"I've said we'll have to increase legal immigration in order to secure the Social Security of boomers (otherwise, the ratio of working population to retirees gets too far out of whack), but don't recall saying anything more,\" Reich wrote to the National Review.\n\nIn an ABC News debate, Crist said his plan to help preserve Social Security -- to have illegal workers earn a path to citizenship -- was supported by former Clinton labor secretary Robert Reich. But Reich hasn't taken a side on that issue. Reich proposes allowing increased legal immigration to add more workers for each retiree, which is different"}
{"label": "false", "claim": "Donald Trump Among Syrian refugees, \"there aren't that many women, there aren't that many children.\"", "evidence": "Donald Trump is now against bringing any Syrian refugees to the United States, saying he has concerns about how many able-bodied men seem to be fleeing the war-torn nation.\nThis Week host George Stephanopoulos asked Trump on Oct. 4, 2015, why he told a New Hampshire crowd he would send refugees back to Syria should he win the presidency. Trump had previously said he would accept some Syrian refugees for humanitarian reasons.\n\"The migration was strange to me because it seems like so many men,\" Trump answered. \"There aren't that many women, there aren't that many children. It looked like mostly men and they looked like strong men. These looked like physically strong people. And I'm saying, \u2018Where are all the women? Where are all the children?\u2019\u00a0\"\nStephanopoulos told Trump that\u00a0half the refugees are children, which led the billionaire to shift gears and question why the United States was planning to take in so many refugees.\nTrump\u2019s description of Syrian refugees as not being many children and women didn\u2019t sound quite right to us, so we decided to check out it out.\nIt appears Trump was confusing his talking point over a couple of different issues.\nRegistered refugees vs. sea arrivals \u00a0\nIn the interview, Trump started talking about how he heard America was accepting 3,000 refugees, then 10,000, and \"now I hear we want to take in 200,000.\"\nTrump said, \"We don't know where they're coming from, we don't know who they are. They could be ISIS. It could be the great Trojan Horse. I mean this could be one of the great Trojan Horses ever since the original.\"\nHis campaign did not get back to us to clarify his remarks, but to us and experts we consulted, his answer sounds like he had a different refugee population in mind altogether.\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees registers and tracks Syrian refugees in camps spread over several nations, including Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and North African countries. According to numbers we accessed on Oct. 4, the total comes to more than 4 million.\nOf those 4 million, 50.3 percent are female, and 51.1 percent are children (boys and girls) 17 years old or younger. In all, only 23.5 percent of refugees across the Middle East and North Africa being counted by the U.N. were men older than 18.\nSo that settles that argument, right? Not really. Geoffrey Mock, Syrian country specialist for Amnesty International USA, says Trump\u2019s anecdote\u00a0may have been referring to Europe\u2019s mass influx of refugees and migrants, not the U.N.-registered refugees in camps that Stephanopoulos was asking about.\n\"This is a complicated issue, and Trump is right to my mind on a few points, but he\u2019s messing up situations, confusing them terribly so his overall point is way off base,\" Mock said.\nTrump likely meant so-called \"sea arrivals,\" refugees and migrants who cross the Mediterranean Sea to continental Europe. The U.N. counts almost 534,000 people who have crossed into Europe this year, with almost 3,000 dying during the journey. To Trump\u2019s point, 69 percent of sea arrivals are men, and these are the people dominating headlines about the humanitarian crisis in Europe.\n\n"}

Without an extension through 2014, checks for the long-term unemployed would stop at the end of the month. The matter is intertwined with the budget deal that Republicans and Democrats are negotiating behind closed doors.\nThe extension\u2019s price tag is $26 billion. Democrats support it, but Republicans do not want to see the expense added to the national debt.\nConservatives also argue that providing the additional money will simply encourage some people to turn down jobs they would otherwise accept. The longer they stay out of work, conservatives say, the less desirable they become in the eyes of a potential employer and the lower their earnings. Ultimately, the economy suffers.\nDavid Madland with the Center for American Progress, a Democratic-leaning group that favors progressive government policies, rebutted that assertion with an opposite economic argument.\n\"The CBO (Congressional Budget Office) just said if we cut this extension, we will kill jobs, because those people who are looking for work won't have any money to spend,\" Madland said on CNN\u2019s Crossfire.\nMadland told PunditFact he was referring to a report the Congressional Budget Office issued Dec. 3. We looked at that report. The budget office, the ultimate nonpartisan authority on money matters facing Congress, determined extending those additional unemployment checks would boost the economy by two-tenths of a percent next year and add about 200,000 jobs.\nThat makes Madland's broader point -- that extending unemployment benefits actually boosts job creation -- correct. But he erred is suggesting the CBO determined that failing to extend unemployment benefits would \"kill\" jobs. The CBO did not analyze that.\nThe report also came with a cautionary note. It said that if the government borrows more to pay for the extension then the move would \"eventually reduce the nation\u2019s output and income slightly below what would occur under current law.\"\nSteven Elliott, an economist at Miami University in Ohio, said the Congressional Budget Office is applying basic economic theory.\n\n"}

We decided to see if Greene\u2019s statistics held up.\nCorrelation between reading level and college\nA 2010 study by the University of Chicago found that third-grade reading level can be a powerful predictor of future academic success. Researchers tracked thousands of students in the Chicago Public School system from third grade through their high school graduations.\nThe students took a test in the third grade that measured their reading ability and compared their results with national scores. Students who scored lower than 75 percent of third graders nationwide were defined as \"below grade level.\"\nAmong students who read below grade level in third grade, only 45 percent graduated high school in five years. Graduation rates were much higher for students who read at grade-level (60 percent) and above grade level (80 percent).\nThe study controlled for demographic factors, so researchers could examine the correlation\u00a0between test scores and graduation rates without worrying that race or poverty were influencing the results. Though the variables are correlated -- which means a change in one is connected to a change in the other -- the connection is not causal. Low third grade test scores are not causing kids to dropout of high school.\nLikewise, students who read at or below grade level in third grade were significantly less likely to attend college than their peers. Only about 20 percent of below-grade-level students attended college, whereas roughly a third of at grade-level students did. Nearly 60 percent of above-grade-level readers attended college.\nReading level and prison\nThere are no studies that directly connect third-grade reading level to incarceration, so the Greene campaign connected it by a two-step process.\nAs noted in the Chicago study, and backed up by the Annie E. Casey Foundation and Georgia governor\u2019s office, students who score below grade level on third grade reading tests are less likely to graduate. Then, there are studies that show high school dropouts are more likely to go to prison. A study from Northeastern University showed that a man with a high school degree had a 1 in 33 chance of incarceration. For a high school dropout, that rate rose to 1 in 10.\nSo, the Greene campaign argues, students who read below grade-level in third grade tend not to graduate high school, and people who don\u2019t graduate high school tend to have higher incarceration rates.\nKatharine Abraham, director of the University of Maryland Center for Economics and Public Policy, said this conclusion \"seems plausible but doesn\u2019t necessarily follow from the cited facts.\" The term \"correlation\" implies that two variables are related, and that one will change alongside the other. One can not assume that because variables A and B are related, and B and C are related, A is also correlated to C.\n\n"}

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Kriner Cash The education tax burden for Shelby County -- and Tennessee -- is \"one of the lowest in the country.\"", "evidence": "Education funding issues often provoke emotional arguments, and a measure to increase the local option sales tax in Shelby County by a half cent has led to accusations that an education-advocacy group is trying to manipulate voter sensibilities with misleading claims about the benefits for school-children.\n\nWe've covered some education funding issues before, like the claim that the education burden on Tennessee and Shelby County taxpayers is among the lowest in the nation (Mostly True) and the assertion that local governments have not increased spending on schools over six budget cycles (True).\n\nIn this case, Stand For Children is leading the campaign to persuade voters in Memphis and unincorporated Shelby County to raise the local option sales tax levied by the county from the current 2.25 percent to 2.75 percent (the state sales tax rate is 7.0). The overarching message on expensive, glossy mailers -- the future of the adorable children smiling in photos will be brighter if voters approve the half-cent sales tax increase.\n\nStand is allied with a bi-partisan coalition of supporters, including Memphis Mayor A C Wharton and most of the Memphis City Council, Shelby County Commission chairman Mike Ritz, Memphis Congressman Steve Cohen and the majority of the unified Shelby County Board of Education. They argue the increase is necessary to help fund the $57 million shortfall that Shelby County's schools merger Transition Planning Commission says will occur if all their schools consolidation recommendations are approved by the unified county school board.\n\nOpponents, including Shelby County Mayor Mark Luttrell and Memphis City Councilman Jim Strickland, contend that until a clearer picture is available for the exact budget needs of the consolidating school systems in Memphis and Shelby County, it is premature to levy an additional tax.\n\nStand is making a slew of claims, some of which elude the Truth-O-Meter process because they involve opinions, hypotheticals and interpretations about the will of elected officials. \"Small change can make a big difference for all of our kids\" reads one line, and another claims the revenue \"will make our schools better.\" Both are clearly opinions.\n\nStand also says the money will allow for expansion of pre-kindergarten and training for teachers, while also possibly helping expand hours at libraries and community centers. Strickland especially objects to what he calls the pre-K \"promise,\" and indeed it remains to be seen whether the school board will follow through on the recommendations of the Transition Planning Commission and its own committees and staff to expand pre-K. There are budget and logistical issues that could delay or derail the plan to offer pre-K to all children who need it.\n\nStand in some cases has adjusted, for instance, by qualifying its language on pre-K. But on one issue it has only raised the volume -- that whatever else is argued about increasing the county sales tax, $31 million is guaranteed to flow to the county's schools because state law requires half of the proceeds of a local option sales tax to be spent on schools.\n\nThat's the claim we are examining here.\n\nWhen we contacted Stand, its Memphis-based state director, Kenya Bradshaw, almost immediately emailed back a copy of Tennessee Code Annotated 67-6-712, \"Distribution of revenue\" under the \"The 1963 Local Option Revenue Act.\"Bradshaw was a member of the county Transition Planning Commission that made pre-K for all who need it one of its highest priorities, and she carries around an actual copy of the statute.\n\nIt deals with the local option sales tax \u00a0and very plainly states that \"one-half (1/2) of the proceeds shall be expended and distributed in the same manner as the county property tax for school purposes is expended and distributed.\"\n\nIt also says that the the proceeds can be pledged \"to the punctual payment of principal of and interest on bonds, notes or other evidence of indebtedness\" but doing so requires the approval of the local school board.\n\nEstimates of the revenue expected to be raised from that county sales tax increase have run between $60 million and $62 million -- it depends in part on projections of future economic activity. So $30-31 million per year would, in fact, be guaranteed for schools. The half that does not go to schools is returned to the municipalities where they were collected, and of that non-schools portion $23 \u00a0million is expected to flow to Memphis.\n\nOne core issue is that approval of the countywide increase would trump the votes in August referendums by suburban municipalities to apply a half-cent local option sales tax as a way to raise revenue to fund municipal school districts they hope to operate.\n\nOpposition to the increase in some suburban municipalities is therefore fierce, because it would mean lower overall revenue than was expected for some municipal school districts. Some opponents argue that the vote is basically an anti-suburban municipal schools money grab by Memphis interests. Residents in those suburbs do not get a vote because they already have authorized sales tax increases for their towns.\n\nAnother argument by proponents is that a vote against the half-cent sales tax increase is essentially a vote for a property-tax increase to fund the expected budget gap created because of schools consolidation.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThere is clearly much for voters to consider on the referendum to increase by a half-cent the county's sales tax rate, and the contentiousness related to the Shelby County's reorganization of \u00a0public schools has created some confusion for voters.\n\nOn one of the most crucial issues, Stand For Children claims half the proceeds from the local option sales tax must go to schools"}

{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Lamar Alexander The health care bill \"dumps 15 to 18 million low-income Americans into a Medicaid program that none of us want to be a part of because 50 percent of doctors won't see new patients.\"", "evidence": "Little known fact: The health care bill will open up Medicaid to millions of Americans.The expansion has been overshadowed by debate over the public option, taxes on \"Cadillac\" health care plans, and a litany of other controversial items in the overhaul. But during the Feb. 25, 2010, health care summit between President Barack Obama and members of Congress, Sen. Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican, pointed to the provision as one of his biggest problems with the bill.\"It dumps 15 to 18 million low-income Americans into a Medicaid program that none of us want to be a part of because 50 percent of doctors won't see new patients,\" Alexander told Obama in his opening remarks. \"So it's like giving someone a ticket to a bus line where the buses only run half the time.\"No one likes to wait for the bus, so we decided to look into Alexander's claim.Currently, Medicaid is available to low-income individuals who are pregnant, disabled, elderly or have children 18 years old or younger; the program covers about 60 million patients. The Senate and House health care bills, and Obama's latest health care proposal, would open up the program to all people under 65 with a low income. The Obama proposal and the Senate bill would offer Medicaid benefits to those with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, while the House version would allow those with incomes up to 150 percent of the federal poverty level to enroll. All that would mean a major expansion of the program. Medicaid is funded jointly by the states and the federal government, but administered by the states. So, the proposed expansion has proven particularly controversial among state officials, who say local budgets are already strapped and can't handle additional enrollees. One of the biggest complaints among doctors is that Medicaid reimbursements are already too low. We asked Alexander's office for some information on the statement, and his spokesman, Ryan Loskarn, pointed us to two recent studies about impacts of the potential law change. The first, compiled by the Congressional Budget Office, was published on Dec. 19, 2009, and looked at the impact of the Senate bill's Medicaid expansion provision. The CBO estimated that the expansion would increase the number of enrollees in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program by about 15 million, costing states about $26 billion over 10 years. (CBO does not specify how many of those would be only Medicaid patients, but the experts we spoke with told us that they would make up the vast majority of new enrollees.)The second study was published on Jan. 8, 2010, by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. According to the report, the Senate bill would put 18 million people on the Medicaid beneficiary list. An additional 2 million with employer-sponsored health insurance would enroll in Medicaid for supplemental coverage. So, if anything, Alexander is understating the high end of the overall estimate. Meanwhile, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a group that analyzes health care policy, estimated that Medicaid would enroll as many as 17.1 million new beneficiaries under the health care bill. So, by all accounts, Alexander is in the ballpark on how many people would be newly eligible for Medicaid.To back up the second part of Alexander's claim -- that 50 percent of doctors won't see new Medicaid patients -- Alexander's office pointed us to a 2007 Wall Street Journal article about access issues in Medicaid. The story mentioned a 2006 report from the Center for Studying Health System Change that estimated nearly half of doctors have stopped accepting or limited the number of Medicaid patients. According to that 2006 study, about 52 percent of doctors surveyed said they were accepting all new Medicaid patients, while only 21 percent said they were accepting no new patients. Presumably, the rest of the doctors surveyed were limiting to some degree the number of new Medicaid patients they were accepting. So, to say that 50 percent of doctors are accepting no new Medicaid patients based on that study is incorrect, said Alwyn Cassil, the group's director of public affairs. Furthermore, the Center for Studying Health System Change updated those figures in 2009 and provided more detail. Currently, 40.2 percent of doctors are accepting all new Medicaid patients, 12.4 percent are accepting most, 19.2 percent are accepting some, and 28.2 percent are accepting no new patients.Cassil did emphasize the fact that the 2006 study and the 2009 study are hard to compare because the group has changed its survey methods in the last few years. In 2006, for example, the group spoke with doctors over the phone. This time around, they administered a written survey. So, the group doesn't know if the most recent statistics are really worse than they were a few years ago or if patient rejection was simply underreported during the last survey.Nevertheless, Alexander raises a good point, Cassil said. \"It is a valid point to raise, physician willingness to accept new Medicaid patients,\" she said. \"If you're going to be throwing another 15 million into the program, you've got to be thinking about that.\"Joan Alker, executive director for the Georgetown Center for Children and Families, agreed that Alexander's statement is generally true, but glosses over some important details. \"I would say that certainly, access to physicians is a concern and that there's room for improvement,\" she said. \"But being on Medicaid provides more access to patients,\" than they would get if they had no insurance at all. Alexander's statement \"suggests that having Medicaid is meaningless, which is misleading.\"Leighton Ku, a health policy professor at George Washington University, said that those statistics are more nuanced than they seem. First, he pointed out, Medicaid patients surveyed often don't report great difficulty in finding doctors. But more importantly, Medicaid patients tend to be concentrated; there are many doctors that see just a few Medicaid patients, and a handful of clinics that see a lot. So, it's reasonable to think that some doctors aren't seeing new Medicaid patients because there are not many in their area. Finally, he said, many primary care physicians aren't seeing new patients at all, whether they are on Medicaid or have private insurance. In the first part of his statement, Alexander is in the ballpark: Anywhere from 15 to 18 million new patients could enroll in Medicaid if the health care overhaul is put into law. We also found that Alexander's underlying point, that some Medicaid patients might have trouble finding doctors, is a valid concern. But he overstates the percentage of doctors that won't accept new Medicaid patients and based that claim on old data"}
{"label": "false", "claim": "Jamie Radtke George Allen \"had 40,000 earmarks\" while he was a senator.", "evidence": "Jamie Radtke wants to tag George Allen, the frontrunner in the June 12 Republican primary for the U.S. Senate, as a big spender.\n\nIn a recent web video, Radtke\u2019s campaign claims that Allen \"voted for 40,000 earmarks\" during his previous term as a senator from 2001 to 2007. Earmarks are money sent to constituents for pet projects by members of Congress.\n\nLast year, we ruled that Radtke\u2019s claim that Allen \"had 40,000 earmarks\" was False. Her campaign sought to clarify her words, saying Radtke\u2019s statement merely meant Allen had voted for that many earmarks. We did not accept their explanation and pointed out several other claims by Radtke that suggested Allen personally requested all that pork.\n\nThis time around, Radtke has altered her verb and given us a new claim to check. Did Allen really vote for 40,000 earmarks during his Senate term?\n\nChuck Hansen, a spokesman for the campaign, said the number is based on a calculation by the Citizens Against Government Waste, a nonprofit group that tracks earmarks and releases annual reports of \"pork projects.\"\n\nAllen, as a senator, voted on the budgets from fiscal years 2002 to 2006. The 2007 budget did not pass until late January of that year, a few weeks after Allen left the Senate. He was defeated the previous fall by Democrat Jim Webb.\n\nThe five budgets Allen voted on included 52,319 earmarks valued at $121.8 billion, according to the Citizens Against Government Waste. Hansen said that Radtke\u2019s campaign, seeking to be conservative in its claim, chopped off about 25 percent the Citizens\u2019 numbers and estimated Allen voted for 40,000 earmarks valued at $90 billion.\n\nBut there\u2019s an important fact that Radtke omits: Allen did not vote on each earmark individually. They were attached to about four dozen major appropriations bills that Allen supported during his time in the Senate. Those bills authorized a total of about $4.4 trillion in discretionary spending programs -- including defense, education and justice -- and the earmarks added up to less three percent of that total.\n\nEven the watchdog groups that have criticized earmarks as wasteful don\u2019t totally blame Allen for supporting appropriations bills that kept government operating.\n\n\"If anyone against earmarks voted against appropriations bills, we wouldn\u2019t get anything done,\" said Leslie Paige, media director for Citizens Against Government Waste. \"We don\u2019t think that\u2019s very telling. We would really rather look at what the member of Congress requested in earmarks and what bills they introduced on their own.\"\n\nSteve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said Allen didn\u2019t necessarily support \"each and every earmark.\" He cited the $225 million \"Bridge to Nowhere,\" connecting the city of Ketchikan, Alaska, with the Island of Gravina, which has 50 residents.\n\nAllen voted for a \u00a0$286.5 billion highway and transportation bill in 2005 that funded the bridge. Later that year, he got a chance vote specifically on the earmark, when a measure came up to move funding from the Alaska project to a bridge damaged by Hurricane Katrina on I-10 in New Orleans. Allen was one of 15 supporters of the unsuccessful amendment.\n\nEllis, however, does not not give Allen a free pass on earmarks. He noted a few lawmakers -- including Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. -- who voted against spending bills because they objected to earmarks. \u00a0\n\nAllen \"was part of the system and certainly got earmarks when he was in office as well,\" Ellis said. \"You don\u2019t get a total mulligan because the earmarks were part of much larger bills, but it does need that context.\"\n\nWe don\u2019t know how many of those earmarks Allen actually sponsored or requested. Members of Congress weren\u2019t required to disclose whether they requested a particular line item until the year after he left office in 2008. During Allen\u2019s term, Virginia received 1,135 earmarks, valued at about $1.2 billion, which could have been requested by any of Virginia\u2019s 13-member delegation.\n\nAllen clearly sought pork for Virginia. \"Every single earmark I\u2019ve gotten, I\u2019m proud of,\" he told a town hall meeting in Chesterfield County on March 20, 2006, according to a Richmond Times-Dispatch article. Allen said then that legislators who attach earmarks to appropriations bills should be identified.\n\nA few months later, Allen and other members of Virginia's congressional delegation refused cooperate with a Times-Dispatch reporter\u2019s request to identify the earmarks they requested during fiscal 2006. \u00a0\n\nIn this year\u2019s campaign, Allen is calling for a ban on earmarks until the federal budget is balanced. Afterwards, earmarks would require a two-thirds majority.\n\nOur ruling:\n\nRadtke claims that Allen, during his term in the Senate, voted for 40,000 earmarks.\n\nWe have one quibble. Allen did not vote on the earmarks individually. The items were attached to massive appropriations bills supported by Allen that kept the federal government operating. The earmarks amounted to less than 3 percent of the spending contained in those laws.\n\nBut unlike a few lawmakers, Allen never protested the secretive earmark process by voting against an appropriations bill. He went along with the system and said he was \"proud\" of the earmarks he got for Virginia.\n\nThe appropriations bills Allen backed had 52,319 earmarks, according to the Citizens Against Government Waste. Radtke attaches a smaller number to Allen, but we won\u2019t penalize her for understating her case.\n\nSo Radtke\u2019s statement is accurate but needs clarification"}

Since President Obama has been in office, we've reached the point we're cutting the annual deficits in half, and we're going to reduce the overall debt of the United States by $3 trillion over the next 10 years.\"\nOn first glance, the data doesn\u2019t seem to back up the claim that \"the overall debt of the United States\" is poised to drop by $3 trillion -- or even by a dime -- over the next decade.\nA quick refresher: The deficit is a fiscal shortfall for one year, while the debt is the cumulative total of all past deficits, minus any surpluses.\nThe most widely trusted source for federal fiscal projections -- the independent Congressional Budget Office -- recently released an annual report, \"The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2014 to 2024.\"\nIn it, CBO estimated the amount of publicly held federal debt for each of the next 10 years. In 2014, the debt is pegged to be $12.7 trillion. By 2024, the debt is set to rise to almost $21.3 trillion. That\u2019s an $8.6 trillion increase, not a $3 trillion decrease.\nWe also checked to see whether Durbin was talking about a decrease in what CBO projected the debt to be 10 years out.\nIn the equivalent \"Budget and Economic Outlook\" report that was released in 2009, just days before Obama took office, CBO projected that in 2019 -- the final year of that report\u2019s 10-year window -- the debt would be $9.3 trillion. By contrast, in the report released a few weeks ago, CBO projected that the debt level in 2019 would be $16 trillion. So again, the future projection of debt is going up, not down.\nWhen we checked with Durbin\u2019s office, spokesman Max Gleischman said the senator was referring to \"the amount of deficit reduction Congress has already enacted,\" adding that \"he actually understates it by about a trillion dollars.\"\n\n"}
{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "George LeMieux Says Charlie Crist \"was pro-life, pro-gun and vehemently anti-tax.\"", "evidence": "After former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist endorsed President Barack Obama and secured a speaking spot at the Democratic National Convention, Republicans pulled out the Crist files to highlight how much the Republican-turned-independent Crist had changed in just four years.\n\nGeorge LeMieux, a Republican and a former Crist chief of staff, wrote a biting op-ed about Crist\u2019s former stances.\n\n\"He never met a tax increase he liked. ... The Charlie Crist I knew idolized Ronald Reagan and embraced Reagan's view of limited government. He was pro-life, pro-gun and vehemently anti-tax. He believed big government was the enemy of success, and that when government taxed it took \u2018your money.\u2019\"\n\nIn this fact-check we will explore whether Crist was \"pro-life, pro-gun and vehemently anti-tax.\"\n\nFirst, we will note what Crist said of himself in February 2010: \"I am pro-life, I\u2019m pro-gun, I\u2019m pro-family and I\u2019m anti-tax. And I always have been.\" He made those claims at a Christian Family Coalition breakfast while running for U.S. Senate as a Republican. He would ditch the GOP label for no-party about two months later as he was struggling in his primary bid against Marco Rubio.\n\n \"Pro-life\"\n\nCrist\u2019s stance on abortion over his political career is too complex to boil down to a sound bite -- even if Crist tried to do that himself at times.\n\nWhen he was running for the U.S. Senate in 1998, Crist said in a questionnaire for the Tampa Bay Times that he was pro-choice, but not pro-abortion. \"I believe that a woman has the right to choose, but would prefer only after careful consideration and consultation with her family, her physician and her clergy; not her government,\" he said. Crist said in a debate during that campaign that he would not support a constitutional ban on abortion.\n\nIn 2006, when he was running for governor, Crist said he was pro-life. But he would not support repealing Roe vs. Wade and opposed a 24-hour waiting period. \"I don't think that politicians ought to put themselves in the place of physicians, and I think it's very important to respect the medical profession,\" said Crist, whose father is a doctor.\n\nIn 2010, as a Republican U.S. Senate candidate, Crist said he would \"fight for pro-life legislative efforts.\"\n\nBut later in 2010, after leaving the Republican Party, Crist vetoed a bill that would have required women seeking abortions to get an ultrasound. He said he found the requirement that women pay for the procedure \"punitive\" and that the measure was \"almost mean spirited.\"\n\n \"Pro-gun\"\n\nWhen Crist was running for U.S. Senate in 2010, we reviewed a claim that he \"never wavered in his support of the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms.\" We ruled that claim True and will briefly review what we found for that article.\n\nIn one of his first high-profile gun battles, then-state senator Crist blasted Gov. Lawton Chiles' last-minute effort to require criminal background checks and a waiting period for purchases made at gun shows in 1998. The legislation proposal died.\n\nAs attorney general, Crist nominated Marion P. Hammer, former president of the National Rifle Association, to the Florida Women's Hall of Fame, and she was inducted in 2004. Hammer is also the longtime president of the state\u2019s NRA affiliate Unified Sportsmen of Florida.\n\nIn his 2006 primary against Republican rival Tom Gallagher, Crist ran an ad calling Gallagher \"anti-gun\" and highlighting Crist\u2019s endorsement from the NRA. As governor, Crist signed into law legislation that allowed 500,000 concealed weapons permit-holders to bring their guns to work as long as the weapons remained in their vehicles.\n\n\"Anti-tax\"\n\nTo examine Crist\u2019s actions about taxes, we reviewed multiple reports from Florida TaxWatch and newspaper articles. We also interviewed staff at Florida TaxWatch as well as Amy Baker, the state\u2019s chief economist. Here are some highlights from his tenure as governor:\n\n2007: Crist repeatedly promised Floridians that their taxes would \"drop like a rock.\" Crist and the Legislature attempted to deliver that through a question put to voters, Amendment 1, which increased the homestead property tax exemption. Voters approved it in January 2008.\n\nKurt Wenner, vice president of tax research at Florida TaxWatch, said that taxes didn\u2019t really drop like a rock but \"there was some reduction in them.\" But much of that happened due to the decline in property values.\n\nIn his first proposed budget in 2007, Crist called for continuing sales tax holidays and reducing the communications services tax.\n\n2008: Crist\u2019s budget proposal suggested dealing with a drop in revenues by using reserves and trust funds. He recommended two more sales tax holidays, one for hurricane\npreparedness and one for back-to-school, a savings to taxpayers of $36 million.\n\n2009: Crist\u2019s budget didn\u2019t call for general tax hikes, but he did ultimately support a $1 a pack cigarette tax hike and surcharge on other tobacco products. That tax hike added up to about $1 billion a year, said Dominic Calabro, president of Florida TaxWatch.\n\nCrist also signed a budget that included new fees including a package of increased and new Highway Safety Fees for about $1 billion in recurring dollars.\n\nThe Miami Herald quoted Crist as saying: \"The cigarette tax is appropriate and I really view it more as a health issue than I do as a tax issue.''\n\nIf Crist had vetoed the cigarette tax, the state would have lost nearly $2 billion in federal Medicaid matching funds.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Times wrote that Crist would call taxes the \"T-word\" as if it was an obscenity but would warm up if called a \"user fee.\"\n\n2010: TaxWatch wrote that Crist\u2019s budget proposal in January 2010 called for $2.7 billion in increased spending and $100 million in tax cuts by relying on federal money, Seminole gambling Compact and raiding trust funds.\n\nCalabro said that Crist could have done more to reign in spending during his tenure.\n\nBut Wenner said that \"generally throughout his career (Crist) was in favor of reducing taxes for the average Floridian.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nLeMieux said that Gov. Charlie Crist \"was pro-life, pro-gun and vehemently anti-tax.\" Crist did describe himself in similar language in 2010 while he was still a Republican and running for U.S. Senate. And we agree that he was consistently for gun rights.\n\nHis record on abortion was more mixed. At different times, he called himself \"pro-life\" and he called himself \"pro-choice.\" And even when he called himself \"pro-life\" in 2006, he said he would not support overturning Roe vs. Wade. In 2010, he earned cheers from abortion rights supporters when he vetoed a bill that would force women who are getting abortions to undergo an ultrasound.\n\nCrist portrayed himself as anti-tax and generally avoided tax increases, although he did support the cigarette tax hike and other increases in fees"}

Joe Biden characterized Sen. John McCain's position on timelines for withdrawal from Iraq as an unequivocal \"no.\"\n\nHere's the full context of Biden's claim:\n\n\n\"Should we trust John McCain's judgment when he says \u2014 when he says we can't have ... timelines to draw down our troops from Iraq, that we must stay indefinitely?\" Biden said. \"Or should we listen to Barack Obama, who says shift the responsibility to the Iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home? Now, after six long years, the administration and the Iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home. John McCain was wrong, and Barack Obama was right.\"\n\n\nBut does McCain really say \"there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from Iraq\"?\n\n\nIt is true that on many occasions McCain has vociferously opposed the idea of setting a timetable \u2014 or a timeline (we believe the words are interchangeable) \u2014 for withdrawal from Iraq. During the Republican primary contest, McCain harshly criticized Mitt Romney's use of the term \"timetable,\" saying it was \"the buzzword for withdrawal.\" For days he carried around a note card with Romney's words to remind primary voters of Romney's endorsement of a timetable.\n\n\nHowever, it is also true that more recently McCain has adjusted his rhetoric. In a July speech, McCain said: \"I'm confident we will be able to reduce our forces in Iraq next year and our forces will be out of regular combat operations and dramatically reduced in number during the term of the next president of the United States.\"\n\n\nAnd on other more recent occasions, when criticizing timelines, he has been careful to characterize them first. Here's McCain on Aug. 18: \"The hard-won gains of our troops hang in the balance. The lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the Middle East could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines.\"\n\n\nNote the insertion of the word \"arbitrary.\" On other occasions McCain has criticized \"artificial\" timelines.\nBut that does not mean he is opposed to any timelines at all. Rather, that language implies that if a timeline were not \"arbitrary\" or \"artificial,\" McCain could support it.\n\n\nIndeed, here's McCain in a CNN interview on July 25, when asked about Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's endorsement of a timetable:\n\n\n\"He said it's a pretty good timetable based on conditions on the ground,\" McCain said. \"I think it's a pretty good timetable, as we should \u2014 or horizons for withdrawal \u2014 but they have to be based on conditions on the ground.\"\n\n\nThat wasn't the clearest statement in the world. So ABC's George Stephanopoulos pressed McCain on the issue on\n\nThis Week\n\ntwo days later:\n\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Obama was in London this morning, and he was responding to your comments from yesterday when you said that 16 months might be a pretty good timetable in Iraq. He said, 'We're pleased to see that there's been some convergence around proposals we've been making for a year-and-a-half.'\n\n\nMCCAIN: That's really good. Look, it's not a timetable, as I said. I was asked, how does that sound? Anything sounds good to me, but\u2026\n\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But you never used the word before.\n\n\n"}

The ad says Amendment 4 \"will force counties and cities across Florida to raise taxes and fees.\" The footnote attached to the claim points back to a PolitiFact Florida article from March 16, 2010.\n\nWe love the publicity and notoriety that comes with being quoted in a full page advertisement running in one of the state's largest newspapers.\n\nBut we love being quoted accurately more.\n\nIn this case, we weren't.\n\nFirst, in case you don't know, here's some background on Amendment 4.\n\nAmendment 4 was placed on the November ballot after Hometown Democracy was able to collect 676,811 petition signatures statewide, more than the state requirement to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot. The proposal is summarized as follows on the election ballot: \"Establishes that before a local government may adopt a new comprehensive land use plan, or amend a comprehensive land use plan, the proposed plan or amendment shall be subject to vote of the electors of the local government by referendum, following preparation by the local planning agency, consideration by the governing body and notice.\"\n\nEssentially the proposal would allow voters to decide on changes to local land use plans, rather than having the decision rest in the hands of city councils, county commissions\u00a0or appointed local planning agencies.\n\nSupporters argue that\u00a0the measure will give more power to local residents by allowing them to make decisions regarding development plans in their communities. Opponents argue Amendment 4 will stall existing projects and drive away prospective developers from investing money in Florida.\n\nWe've rated several claims on both sides of Amendment 4, which you can see here.\n\nThe claim we're analyzing in this case stems from a statement we examined in the spring. Back in March, Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy claimed that the tiny Pinellas community of St. Pete Beach had terrible experiences with its own version of Amendment 4, resulting in \"seemingly endless lawsuits (that) decimated the city's legal budget and forced the city to raise the property tax rate.\"\n\nWe found two half truths in the statement back then.\n\n1). We didn't agree that Amendment 4 and St. Pete Beach's version of hometown democracy were the same thing. Here's what we wrote about the comparison then:\n\n\"A group of St. Pete Beach residents, unhappy with the direction of their city government, successfully wrestled certain land use decisions out of the hands of elected leaders. The movement produced a backlash from both the government and pro-development forces, who then mounted their own political campaign to wrestle power back. The power struggle has continued for close to four years.\n\n\"That's a different storyline than what is envisioned under Amendment 4, where voters would act as a check on the decisions of local government. The amendment itself isn't designed to go around government the way the situation in St. Pete Beach played out. And it has nothing to do with citizens proposing amendments to the local comprehensive plan, like what has happened in St. Pete Beach. Now, are the same lawsuits and political maneuvering possible? Absolutely. And maybe that's enough to make the analogy valid.\n\n\"But voters should be wary in blindly believing that St. Pete Beach's experiences would be duplicated statewide should Amendment 4 pass.\"\n\n2). We didn't think St. Pete Beach's hometown democracy rule generated lawsuits that forced the city to raise its property tax rate. Declining property values, more than anything else, forced the tax rate increase in 2009. Here's what we wrote then:\n\n\"Yes, there were lawsuits, but they weren't the only costs mentioned for the city legal department (during budget talks). Yes, the city slightly raised its rate in 2009 -- although the net result still was a decrease on most homeowners because of sharply falling property values. But the discussion at a town meeting indicates that the decision was motivated by several factors, most notably the decline in property values, as well as legal fees.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nLet's look at what Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy said again in its ad. Citing PolitiFact, it said Amendment 4 \"will force counties and cities across Florida to raise taxes and fees.\"\n\nWell, we can speak unequivocally about this one. PolitiFact Florida never said that what happened in St. Pete Beach's case will happen in cities and counties across Florida if Amendment 4 is approved.\u00a0We never said it\u00a0in any other Truth-O-Meter\u00a0items either.\u00a0And even ignoring that, PolitiFact Florida never said St. Pete Beach's local hometown democracy rules forced the city to raise its tax rate"}

The meme is headlined \"I\u2019m not ready for Hillary\" -- a takeoff on the PAC that supported Clinton during the months leading up to her official announcement -- and proceeds to list five reasons to oppose the former secretary of state.\nIn this article, we\u2019ll check one of those claims -- that Clinton \"refuses to testify before Congress about what really happened at Benghazi where four Americans died.\"\nAs most readers will recall, on Sept. 11, 2012, Islamic extremists attacked U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, killing U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. Clinton was secretary of state at the time, and critics -- many of them Republicans -- have insisted there\u2019s more to be learned about the attacks.\nHowever, the claim in the meme struck us as odd, since Clinton has already testified twice on Benghazi, both on Jan. 23, 2013. On that day, she testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the morning and before the House Foreign Affairs Committee in the afternoon.\nIn fact, this produced some memorable and widely replayed video when Clinton offered an exasperated comment in response to questioning by Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis. \"With all due respect,\" she said, \"the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they\u2019d they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, senator.\"\nSo the meme\u2019s claim seems wrong on its face. We could not track down the meme\u2019s creator, and we did not receive a response to an email sent to an author who wrote about it for a conservative website.\nThere is a committee -- the House Select Committee on Benghazi chaired by Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C. -- that\u2019s still investigating the matter. The committee and Clinton have indeed had some trouble coming to an agreement about her appearance before the committee. But the bones of contention are primarily logistical, not because Clinton \"refuses to testify.\"\nQuite the contrary: In a letter written to the committee on May 4, 2015, Clinton\u2019s lawyer, David E. Kendall, made that clear.\n\n"}
{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "John Kasich \"Two million federal workers negotiate zippo, zero. There is no collective bargaining for federal employees.\"", "evidence": "Equity among workers is one of Republican Gov. John Kasich\u2019s most consistent arguments in favor of Ohio\u2019s new collective bargaining law.\n\nThe law, Senate Bill 5, will bring Ohio\u2019s public workers closer in line with private sector workers, who, on average, pay more for health care benefits and have weaker pensions, Kasich repeatedly has said.\n\nNow the governor is weaving collective bargaining for federal workers \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 into his support for the law.\n\nEven though SB 5 restricts collective bargaining for the state\u2019s 360,000 public workers, they would still be better off than federal workers, Kasich recently told a Youngstown radio show.\n\n\"Two million federal workers negotiate zippo, zero,\" Kasich told radio host Dan Rivers on April 26 when discussing SB 5. \"There is no collective bargaining for federal employees.\"\n\nKasich has been among the most vocal supporters of SB 5, and likely will continue to fill that role if the law heads toward a voter referendum this fall.\n\nConsidering his influence and the widespread interest in SB 5, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check the governor\u2019s claim about collective bargaining for federal workers.\n\nWe did not have to dig deep to get started.\n\nOur colleagues at PolitiFact checked a similar statement Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker made in late February, when his state, like Ohio, was in the middle of a controversial effort to pass legislation to limit collective bargaining for public workers.\n\nWalker told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press host David Gregory that \"most federal employees do not have collective bargaining for benefits, nor for pay.\"\n\nPolitiFact gave Walker\u2019s claim a True rating. So how does Kasich\u2019s similar claim hold up?\n\nFederal workers generally cannot collectively bargain pay and benefits, but they can negotiate working conditions, according to the Federal Labor Relations Authority, which administers the labor-management relations program for more than 1 million federal workers.\n\n\"Employees also have the right to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment through representatives chosen by employees,\" the FLRA\u2019s program guide reads.\n\nThere are about 1.6 million non-postal federal workers. Of those, about 1.1 million are represented by more than 90 labor organizations. Some workers in agencies such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission can negotiate wages. Others in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Government Accountability Office and other departments do not engage in collective bargaining.\n\nFor the most part, however, federal workers only can negotiate working conditions, said Sarah Whittle Spooner, FLRA counsel for regulatory and external affairs.\n\nThe right to negotiate working conditions is significant, said Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of labor education research at Cornell University. (PolitiFact also interviewed Bronfenbrenner while checking Gov. Walker\u2019s claim. We interviewed her separately.)\n\nBronfenbrenner pointed to a recent union election among the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s 43,000 workers. They had three options: either of two unions vying to represent them or no union at all. More than 16,000 of the workers voted in favor of a union representation and about 3,000 voted for neither union. Because the vote between the two unions was so close, there will be a runoff election May 23 to June 21.\n\n\"Would they have organized a union if they didn\u2019t have the right to bargain?\" Bronfenbrenner asked. \"They wouldn\u2019t have gone through all this if there wasn\u2019t something at the end of the tunnel.\"\n\nSo what does it mean for federal workers who can negotiate working conditions?\n\nIt means they can negotiate discipline policies, hours of work, procedures for performance evaluations, safety, procedures for layoffs and more, according to the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employees union, with about 625,000 members from about 75 federal agencies.\n\nKasich spokesman Rob Nichols acknowledged federal workers do have some ability to bargain collectively.\n\n\"The fact is most federal workers cannot collectively bargain for pay or benefits and the governor\u2019s point is that under Senate Bill 5, Ohio\u2019s public employees will have more collective bargaining rights than most federal employees,\" Nichols said.\n\nSo where does Kasich land on the Truth-O-Meter?\n\nIt would be easy to rate Kasich\u2019s statement False. Federal workers may have limited collective bargaining powers. But that isn't \"zippo\" and \"zero.\"\n\nBut the governor also is known to shoot from the hip, and ruling an off-the-cuff statement as False without looking at his underlying meaning would amount to a game of gotcha -- a game PolitiFact doesn\u2019t play.\n\nKasich long has advocated reigning in collective bargaining, arguing that schools and governments needed better ability to control labor costs. But he has not called for it\u2019s elimination.\n\nChanges approved in SB 5 would reduce the number of topics subject to union negotiations, ban public workers from striking, prohibit employers from paying more than 85 percent of workers\u2019 health insurance costs, and base pay raises on performance rather than length of service.\n\nBut public workers in Ohio would continue to have more collective bargaining powers than most federal workers, Kasich\u2019s underlying point.\n\nThat some federal workers can bargain over working conditions, rather than having \"zero\" collective bargaining ability, is a critical fact, though, that could give a listener a different impression"}

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., spoke for just under a hour, telling supporters in the crowded conference center that with their help, he is ready to finish what he started in 2016 and take the White House in 2020.\nThe Sanders campaign has said this time around it needs to get more support in Southern states, and generally to reach more minority voters. But Sanders said last week that wasn\u2019t true for all ages, during a visit to the state that gave him his first primary victory in 2016.\n\"That victory right here in New Hampshire led us to win victories in 21 other states around the country, 13 million votes, over 1,700 delegates at the Democratic convention and to me, mostly importantly, more votes from young people \u2014 black, white, Latino, Asian American and Native American \u2014 than Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton combined,\" Sanders said.\nSanders made a similar claim during a CNN town hall in late February when he said, \"We ended up winning among younger people. More votes from young African Americans, Latinos, Asian American, Native Americans than Clinton and Trump combined.\"\nThis seems to complicate a prevailing narrative that Sanders failed to connect with minority voters during the 2016 election. And it would mean a growing group of voters went for him in a big way. We decided to check if his claim holds water.\nVTDigger analyzed 2016 primary data and reached out to polling experts across the country. We found while Sanders did receive more votes from the under-30 set than Clinton and Trump combined, it\u2019s impossible to know -- for us and for Sanders -- whether more minority youth voted for him than the other two candidates.\nWhile his quote in New Hampshire could be read as saying that young people of various ethnicities together voted for him in larger numbers than Trump and Clinton combined, it\u2019s clear from the CNN quote that the claim also applies to each ethnicity on its own.\nArianna Jones, a Sanders campaign spokesperson, told us the claim was based on an exit polling report from the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) and a survey by the University of Chicago\u2019s Black Youth Project.\nThe data compiled\u00a0by CIRCLE estimates that in all the presidential primaries and caucuses, Sanders received more than 2 million total youth votes -- 400,000 more than the estimated combined 1.6 million votes for Clinton and Trump. However, these numbers are not broken down by race or ethnicity.\nIn the University of Chicago study, which asked more than 1,750 people between the ages of 18 and 30 which of the three candidates they support, 60 percent of young African-Americans, 69 percent of young Asian-Americans, 68 percent of the young Latino vote, and 59 percent of young whites said they support Sanders.\nThe survey, conducted in June 2016, also states that among young African-Americans who said they voted in the primaries, 54 percent reported voting for Sanders, but the study does not provide additional information explaining how many said they voted for Clinton or Trump.\n\"Our data indicate that in contrast to the overwhelming support Hillary Clinton received from older African American voters, the majority of African American young adult voters supported Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic Party primary,\" the study says.\nWe reached out to the University of Chicago and a spokesperson told us the researchers did not validate that these young people actually voted in a primary.\n\"They suggest viewing this question as one of measuring support more than actual votes,\" the spokesperson said.\nWe asked Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, director of CIRCLE at Tufts University, about the Sanders claim. She said CIRCLE also has no way of knowing whether or not his statement is true or false.\n\n"}
{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "J.B. Powell Horse racing could boost Georgia's economy by $1 billion a year and create 10,000 to 20,000 jobs.", "evidence": "Georgia agriculture commissioner candidate J.B. Powell is willing to make a bet on the ponies.\n\nHe wants the Peach State to allow horse racing.\n\n\"Georgians deserve to have a commissioner of agriculture who will fight for common-sense ideas that will help lead Georgia out of the economic challenges we face,\" Powell, the Democratic Party's nominee for commissioner, said in a Sept. 9 news release.\n\nPowell believes horse racing could increase the state's struggling economy by $1 billion a year and create at least 10,000 jobs. Bugle player, begin the first call song please.\n\nPowell is in a three-man race to replace Democrat Tommy Irvin, who has been Georgia's agriculture commissioner since 1969. Gary Black is the Republican Party's nominee. Kevin Cherry is running as a Libertarian.\n\nSo can this plan create as many jobs as Powell says and bring in that much money to Georgia?\n\nThe idea is not new in Georgia. State lawmakers have discussed it before, but some conservatives have been reluctant to support another form of gambling. The state constitution must be amended to allow gambling on horse racing, also known as pari-mutuel betting.\n\nThe candidate's evidence in support of horse racing is a 2006 study done for the Washington, D.C.-based American Horse Council by Deloitte, a well-known financial advisory and auditing firm. Horse racing generates an annual economic impact of $26 billion and nearly 147,000 jobs in the United States, according to the study. The Powell campaign based its estimate on Georgia's potential on how horse racing is performing in Florida. The Deloitte report found Florida sees an annual total economic impact of $2.2 billion from horse racing. The report said horse racing is responsible for 22,000 direct jobs and 51,700 total jobs.\n\nGraham Balch, Powell's campaign manager, noted that the Sunshine State has 18.5 million residents. Georgia's population is about 9.8 million. Since Georgia's population is about one-half of Florida's, Balch believes it is reasonable to conclude Georgia could see 50 percent of the economic impact from horse racing. Another advantage Georgia has is Atlanta ranks only behind Ocala, Fla., and Lexington, Ky., in the number of horse owners.\n\n\"Given Georgia's level of horse ownership and climate and size, it is a realistic projection to say Georgia could at least have an economic impact of $1 billion or more like eight states around the country,\" Balch wrote in an e-mail to AJC PolitiFact Georgia. \"All fact based information leads us to believe that $1 billion in economic impact and 10,000 to 20,000 jobs is the best estimate possible and in our research we have not seen any information to contradict the projections for Georgia.\"\n\nPowell believes Georgia can get to the $1 billion mark, but it will take time -- at least three years.\n\nGeorgia would be beginning in the horse racing business while Florida has a head start, said Jeff Williams, senior vice president of Public Sector Consulting, a nonpartisan research firm that did a study on the economic impact of horse racing in Michigan in 2002.\n\n\"I would be very careful when looking at a neighboring state and say 'They do x and we can do y,' \" Williams said.\n\nThe Michigan study found horse racing had an economic impact of $1.2 billion in 2001. Michigan had a population of nearly 10 million residents in 2000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Regulated pari-mutuel horse racing has been in existence in Michigan since the 1930s. Michigan had seven racetracks at the time. Public Sector Consulting used revenue from racetrack operations as the primary factor to determine the economic impact.\n\nWilliams said Georgia must examine how many people would come for horse racing from outside the state. He said spectators and bettors from Georgia could be taking away revenue from other in-state leisure activities.\n\nWilliams also issued another warning: Horse racing in Michigan was suffering economically at the time of the study. The industry, he and others noted, is now in a more precarious state financially across the country.\n\nSome say the answer is combining horse racing and casino gambling. Arthur H. Anderson, a consultant for a committee attempting to bring racing to Georgia and South Carolina, said places such as Hoosier Park in Indiana show the idea can work. Anderson, who is involved with the Georgia-South Carolina Horse Racing Committee, estimates a casino/racetrack with a \"funplex\" for children and destination shopping can generate about $500 million a year. The committee would use the revenue to support the state's education system.\n\nAnderson supports running two tracks in Georgia, which he says can bring $1 billion to the state. A casino would need state approval, and Georgia's leaders have been against the idea. The Indianapolis Star reported in May that money wagered on horse racing in Indiana has dropped from $190 million in 2005 to $147 million in 2009. Money from slot machines has been used to supplement lagging horse racing revenue, the Star reported. The American Horse Council study found the economic impact of horse racing in Indiana in 2005 was $294 million.\n\nPowell's proposal would not include casino gambling, his campaign manager said.\n\nWe looked at Virginia because it is a Southern state, its population of nearly 8 million people is closer to Georgia's and its one pari-mutuel racetrack, Colonial Downs, opened in 1997. One report from about five years ago shows the annual economic impact of the horse industry is $1 billion, which includes recreation equine activity. Virginia equine leaders note the horse racing business there has suffered in recent years.\n\nThe Deloitte study on Florida found about 40 percent of the horse industry's economic impact in that state comes from racing. At that rate, the annual impact for horse racing in Virginia would be about $400 million. Virginia officials are working on an economic impact study.\n\nWe believe there are some problems in using Florida to determine the potential economic impact of horse racing in Georgia. For example, Florida draws more tourists, some of whom are inclined to visit the racetrack. Some well-respected economists, such as the University of Georgia's Jeff Humphreys, said Powell's estimate may be correct, but more information is needed"}

{"label": "true", "claim": "Citizens for the Republic Children born today will carry a $30,000 share of the national debt.", "evidence": "On Sept. 21, 2010, a group called Citizens for the Republic unveiled a television ad called \"Mourning in America,\" that mirrored, right down to its understated visuals and narration, a famous Ronald Reagan ad from his 1984 re-election campaign titled \"Morning in America.\" Whereas the original ad exuded confidence and pride in the United States under Reagan's leadership, the new version -- aired by a group run by veterans of the Reagan administration -- presented a bleak look at the current state of the economy and a tone of sadness about the country's seemingly diminished prospects.\n\n\"There's mourning in America,\" the ad begins. \"Today, 15 million men and women won't have the opportunity to go to work. Businesses shuttered. Twenty-nine hundred families will have their homes foreclosed by nightfall. This afternoon, 6,000 men and women will be married, each of their children to be born with a $30,000 share of the runaway national debt.\"\n\nWe won't judge whether these statistics support the idea that the country is \"fading,\" that President Barack Obama's policy has \"failed\" or the ad's exhortation to vote for a \"smaller, more caring government.\" But we will look at each of the statistics mentioned in the ad. (The ad was put together by Fred Davis, a leading Republican ad-man. We discuss some of the ads he made this year in a story posted today.)\n\n\u2022 \"Fifteen million men and women won't have the opportunity to go to work.\" According to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics figures, there were 14.9 million unemployed Americans in August. Close enough for us.\n\n\u2022 \"Twenty-nine hundred families will have their homes foreclosed by nightfall.\" According to RealtyTrac, the leading authority on foreclosure statistics, \"lenders foreclosed on 95,364 U.S. properties in August (2010), the highest monthly total in the history of the report.\" If you divide that total by 31 days, you get 3,076 foreclosures per day. That's actually a little more than the ad indicates.\n\n\u2022 \"This afternoon, 6,000 men and women will be married.\" This statistic was presumably included so the current ad would mirror the script of the one from 1984, which cited the then-rate of 6,500 marriages per day as evidence that couples were heading optimistically into the future. Since then, marriage rates have dropped, though it's not clear how much of this is due to economic conditions, as opposed to broader social and demographic trends.\n\nThe most recent figures from the National Center for Health Statistics, a federal agency, show that there were 2,077,000 marriages in 2009. Dividing this total by 365 days, you get 5,690 marriages per day. That's a little lower than what the ad says -- by about 5 percent. Also, those who are really picky may quibble that the number of marriages completed on weekdays is a lot lower than 6,000, and it's a lot higher on weekend days. Still, the ad is pretty close.\n\n\u2022 Each child born will have \"a $30,000 share of the runaway national debt.\" At first, we were confused by this statistic because our reading of the ad's wording suggested that it should involve how many children were going to be born to couples who got married this year. But it turns out this statistic is much simpler than that. The ad writers divided the total estimate for the public debt at the end of 2010 ($9,297,653,000,000) by the total U.S. population (307,006,550) and came out with $30,286 for every man, woman and child.\n\nIn a recent item, we discussed the relative merits of two different measures for the national debt. One is debt held by the public (which the makers of \"Mourning in America\" used, and the other is that amount plus debt held by the government, typically in trust funds for major government programs, including Social Security and Medicare. When we asked economists for their opinion of which measurement is more relevant, each of the two statistics had its fans, so we concluded that both are legitimate measurements. For completeness, we'll note here that using the larger figure, called gross federal debt, the per-person debt load would be just shy of $45,000, which would only make the ad's argument stronger.\n\nPut it all together and you have four statistics that are all very, very close to being accurate"}

During his time in the U.S. House, the Georgia Republican has become known for his strong, conservative opinions and controversial statements involving evolution.\n\nThose strong positions were on full display in a recent fundraising letter to donors that surfaced this week. In soliciting funds for his run for the Senate seat being vacated by Saxby Chambliss, Broun criticized President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and alleged their policies are ruining the country.\n\n\"I was the first member of Congress to call him a socialist who embraces Marxist-Leninist policies like government control of health care and redistribution of wealth,\" Broun says of Obama in the letter.\n\nPolitiFact Georgia sets the bar high when someone says they\u2019re the \"first\" to make a particular statement, so we researched the claim to see if Broun\u2019s bar should be lowered. \u00a0\n\nStories about Broun\u2019s letter were published earlier this week by other news outlets and political pundits across the state.\n\nThe conservative political blog Georgia Tipsheet called the letter \"a predictably confrontational fundraising appeal\" and noted that Broun was among the earliest to attach the (socialist) barb to Obama. The liberal blog Daily Kos called Broun\u2019s letter \"crackpot haiku.\"\n\nIn August 2009, Broun told an audience at North Georgia Technical College that Obama -- along with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Reid -- were members of a \"socialist elite,\" while deriding Obamacare (what critics call the national health care law). Then, in January 2011, after Obama delivered his State of the Union address, Broun said in a Twitter post that the president did not believe in the Constitution, and instead \"You believe in socialism.\"\n\nBroun compared Obama\u2019s policies to those of Hitler or a Marxist dictator in November 2008, but apologized a week later for making the statements. \"The point I tried to make is that he is extremely liberal, he has promoted a lot of socialistic ideas, and it just makes me concerned,\" Broun told an Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter at the time.\n\nObama\u2019s socialist moniker doesn\u2019t stop with Broun.\n\nIn October 2008, then-Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain accused Obama of pursuing a \"socialist\" agenda for telling blue-collar worker Joe the Plumber during a campaign stop that spreading the wealth around is good for everybody. That same month, then-Ohio U.S. Sen. George Voinovich told a newspaper reporter, \"(Obama) is left of Teddy Kennedy.

We ruled that claim Pants on Fire.\n\nBut we\u2019re ruling on a different claim here: whether Broun was the first to place the \"socialist\" label on the president. So was Broun\u2019s claim accurate?\n\nWe called and emailed questions about the letter to Broun\u2019s staff for comment, but received no response.\n\nPolitiFact Georgia found that Broun\u2019s socialist name-calling goes back to 2009 when he said the president was a member of the \"socialist elite,\" and in 2011 said the president believed in socialism. But one of Broun\u2019s congressional colleagues, Sen. George Voinovich of Ohio, called Obama a socialist in October 2008; and Sen. John McCain of Arizona criticized Obama\u2019s \"socialist\" agenda during that same month.\n\nBased on our research, Broun was not the first member of Congress to specifically call Obama a socialist.

Bill Nelson criticized Gov. Rick Scott for not appearing at the CNN town hall following the Parkland shooting.\n\"There is no representative of the state of Florida,\" Nelson said during the Feb. 21 town hall in which Marjory Stoneman Douglas students spoke. \"Our governor did not come here.\"\nDays later at a press conference where Scott announced a proposal for $450 million in school security funding, a reporter asked Scott to respond to Nelson\u2019s criticism. Scott, a Republican, is widely expected to challenge Nelson, a Democrat, in the 2018 elections.\n\"Bill Nelson is a career politician,\" said Scott. \"He talks a lot. He does nothing. Think about it: He has been in office for almost 50 years. He hasn\u2019t done anything on gun safety or school safety, and nothing on gun control.\"\nThat\u2019s a sweepingly broad attack by Scott to claim that Nelson hasn\u2019t done \"anything\" on gun or school safety and mischaracterizes Nelson\u2019s record. We found multiple examples of legislation Nelson supported that related to gun control.\nBefore Nelson was in the Senate\nNelson has supported a ban on assault rifles for decades.\nIn 1990 when running for governor, he promised, \"As governor, I will propose a ban on the sale of assault rifles in Florida, as well as a seven-day waiting period on the sale of firearms.\" At campaign stops in 1990, Nelson waved a weapon\u00a0over his head and said that a campaign aide was able to buy a\u00a0semi-automatic rifle in less than 10 minutes at a Miami gun store.\nWhile in Congress in 1990, Nelson cosponsored the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act to make it unlawful for any licensed dealer to sell a handgun to an unlicensed individual unless certain criteria were met. The legislation ultimately passed in 1993 after Nelson left the House.\nNelson\u2019s legislative record in the U.S. Senate\nNelson\u00a0spokesman Ryan Brown sent PolitiFact a list of more than one dozen bills that Nelson had supported related to gun safety, gun control or school safety. Many were bills he either cosponsored or sponsored or voted in favor of, but many did not become law. Here\u2019s a look at some of the key bills by topic:\nAssault weapons ban: Nelson has repeatedly supported an assault weapons ban that Congress allowed to expire in 2004. This year, Nelson became one of about two dozen cosponsors of a bill to ban semiautomatic assault weapons and large-capacity magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. The bill has not reached any votes.\nBump stocks: Nelson was one of many cosponsors of a 2017 bill to ban bump stocks, an accessory that allows someone to convert a semi-automatic firearm to a nearly fully automatic one.\nImproving background checks: Nelson sponsored a\u00a0bill that would require the Justice Department to include in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System information about an individual who is or has been under a federal terrorism investigation. The bill, which Nelson introduced in 2017 after the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, has not reached any votes. He supported other efforts to strengthen background checks in the past.\nDenying firearms to terrorists: The \"no fly no buy\" bill would deny the transfer of a firearm if the transferee is known (or appropriately suspected) to be engaged in terrorism. Nelson was one of a few dozen cosponsors. The 2015 bill has not received a vote.\nBan certain types of firearms: Nelson sponsored a bill in 2017 to ban firearms that are not detectable by metal detectors if certain components are removed. The bill has not received a vote. He also voted to ban guns with high-capacity magazines holding more than 10 rounds, which failed to pass the Senate in 2013. He also voted for an amendment to require trigger locks and safety devices for handguns in 2004 and to strengthen penalties for the use of so-called cop-killer bullets in 2005 -- both were amendments that passed the Senate.\nConceal-carry reciprocity: Nelson voted against legislation that would allow concealed-carry permits issued in one state to be valid in all others that issue such permits in 2009 and 2013.\nMental health: Nelson voted for the 21st Century Cures Act, which became law in 2016. The bill stated that the attorney general may provide active-shooter response training to local law enforcement and called for the development of crisis intervention teams to include specialized training for school officials in responding to mental health crises. Nelson was one of about two dozen bipartisan cosponsors of the Excellence in Mental Health Act S. 264, which proposed grants to states to build or modernize community-based mental health services.\nAfter the Parkland shooting, Nelson, along with Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and U.S. Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Boca Raton, wrote a letter to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos urging her department to quickly approve applications from the Broward school district for a Project School Emergency Response to Violence grant. The money could be used for mental health services, overtime for law enforcement and school staff, and costs to operate the school at an alternative site.\n\n"}

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Mitt Romney President Ronald Reagan sent troops into conflict \"only in one circumstance, which was in Grenada \u2026 We were in a peacekeeping setting in Lebanon.\"", "evidence": "Mitt Romney\u2019s trip to Europe and Israel gave him the opportunity to talk about foreign affairs, a subject that has received relatively little attention so far in the campaign.\n\nDuring the trip, Romney praised the military strategies of President Ronald Reagan. \"(He) was able to accomplish extraordinary purposes for our country,\" Romney said in an interview on Face the Nation. \"Without having to put our military forces into conflict. Only in one circumstance, which was in Grenada, did our forces go in a conflict setting. We were in a peacekeeping setting in Lebanon.\"\n\nThe implication is that Reagan did not get American forces bogged down in protracted wars. But for this fact check we will focus on whether Romney had his history right. Under Reagan, did U.S. soldiers go into a conflict setting just once and does calling Lebanon a \"peacekeeping setting\" mean that conflict was any less of a threat? (We asked the Romney campaign about this but didn't hear back.)\n\nFor those who may have forgotten, the invasion of Grenada took place in late October 1983. About 5,000 troops subdued Grenadian and Cuban soldiers and laborers in about two days of fighting. The U.S. and six Caribbean nations were concerned about Cuba extending its reach in the region. Deaths included 19 Americans, 45 Grenadians and 59 Cubans.\n\nThe U.S. Navy\u2019s History and Heritage Command has compiled a list of the use of U.S. forces abroad from 1798 to 1993. It makes no distinction between deployments into areas where there was open conflict and those that were more tranquil. During the Reagan administration, from 1981 to 1988, American forces were active on overseas missions 16 times in a total of 12 countries. Often, they played a support role, such as the AWACs electronic surveillance aircraft that provided intelligence to Saudi Arabian fighter jets as they shot down two Iranian fighter planes in 1984.\n\nBut on five or six occasions, U.S. forces took a more direct role. In 1986, the U.S. Navy and Air Force struck targets in Libya. While there was no long-term military engagement, two Air Force flyers died on that mission when their F-111 was hit over Libya.\n\nIn 1987 and 1988, U.S. Navy ships escorted Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf. They were fired upon, hit mines, or encountered some other military action six times. A mine strike nearly sank the USS Samuel Roberts.\n\n\"The crew heroically fought fires for five hours to save their ship,\" said Lance Janda, chair of the History Department at Cameron University. \"A number of crew members were seriously burned and injured.\"\n\n\"One might quibble over the use of the word \u2018conflict,\u2019 \" Janda said. \"As I see it, any time U.S. forces are sent into a region where fighting is taking place, then I think it's fair to say those forces are at risk.\"\n\nStephen Knott, professor of national security affairs at the U.S. Naval War College, agrees. \"Reflagging Kuwaiti tankers was definitely inserting American forces into a \u2018conflict setting\u2019,\" Knott said. \"That is, the war between Iran and Iraq.\"\n\nSeveral historians and foreign policy specialists took issue with Romney calling the Lebanon mission a \u2018peacekeeping setting.'\n\nIn 1982, the United States sent 1,200 troops as part of a U.N. effort to hold the Lebanese government together after the country was splintered by fighting among Christians and Muslims. Bruce Jentleson, professor of public policy and political science at Duke University, says the situation was anything but stable.\n\n\"As the Marine barracks bombing demonstrated,\" Jentleson told PolitiFact, \"there was plenty of danger.\" A suicide truck bomber detonated explosives inside a Marine compound at the Beruit airport, killing 241 soldiers. It was the largest single-day loss of life for Marines since the World War II Battle of Iwo Jima.\n\nJentleson said that until that attack, the troop \"commitment was pretty open-ended. It only ended because of the bombing.\"\n\nKnott interviewed then-Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who had tried to persuade Reagan against that deployment. Weinberger told Knott he said to Reagan, \"They\u2019re in a position of extraordinary danger. They have no mission. They have no capability of carrying out a mission, and they\u2019re terribly vulnerable.\"\n\nThe consensus among the experts we reached is that under Reagan, the U.S. did avoid putting troops on the ground for extended periods of time. Government professor William Wohforth at Dartmouth College said Reagan \"was quite chary of actual military action with U.S. troops.\"\n\nHowever, the U.S. was very much engaged in other ways.\n\n\"In the cold war, the superpowers fought lots of proxy conflicts,\" said Michael O\u2019Hanlon, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \"Leading to huge loss of life from Central America to the Horn of Africa to Central and Southern Africa to Afghanistan.\" Some of those conflicts, such as Afghanistan, began during the Carter administration.\n\nO\u2019Hanlon notes that the U.S. didn\u2019t always follow through with money and efforts to stabilize those countries after the fighting stopped. He points to Afghanistan as a place where the U.S. likely paid a price for that policy when the country became a haven for al Qaeda.\n\nOur ruling\n\nRomney said the U.S. stayed out of conflict settings under Reagan, except once in Grenada. Romney put Lebanon in a separate category of \"a peacekeeping setting.\" The record shows multiple military engagements and a large loss of life in Lebanon. Reagan was wary of the actual use of troops, but he did not stick to that as much as Romney suggests.\n\nRomney may have been thinking of long-term deployments, but he spoke only of whether American soldiers were placed into conflict settings which did take place"}
{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Charles Schumer \"The State Department asked all secretaries of state to send their emails over.\" Hillary Clinton's\u00a0\"the only one who\u2019s done it.\"", "evidence": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t appear on the Sunday political talk shows to explain her use of a private email account to conduct State Department business. But Democrats were out in force to defend her as proxies.\nFor example, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., appeared March 8 on CBS\u2019 Face the Nation to throw cold water on accusations of wrongdoing on the part of Clinton.\n\"The State Department asked all secretaries of state to send their emails over, and she\u2019s the only one who\u2019s done it,\" Schumer said.\nWe decided to dig into Schumer\u2019s claim. Spokesman Matt House said Schumer was referring to an October 2014 letter from the State Department to former secretaries of states.\nThe letter has not been publicly published but its contents were outlined by State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf to the media last week. Harf said the letter was part of a routine effort to update record preservation and asked former secretaries to turn over emails containing state work conducted on personal accounts.\nA couple months after the request, Clinton turned over 55,000 pages of emails and documents from a personal email account created on a self-operated server, according to the New York Times and the State Department.\u00a0Clinton has since requested (via Twitter) for those emails to be released.\nIt\u2019s not as though the letter went out to living secretaries of state dating back to Henry Kissinger. While it may be hard to remember a time before email, only four former secretaries have held the job during the prominence of electronic communications: Clinton, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright.\nAs it is, the State Department query was limited to just those four individuals.\nTwo of those individuals haven\u2019t provided personal emails for good reason:\u00a0They didn\u2019t use email much during their time at the State Department. According to MSNBC, an aide for Albright said she \"did not use email while she was in office\" from 1997 to 2001.\nSimilarly, Rice, head of the State Department from 2005 to 2009, was not a habitual emailer either, according to multiple reports. As Harf noted in a State Department briefing, \"Secretary Rice has repeatedly said that she did not regularly use email,\" and a spokesperson for Rice told ABC, \"She did not use personal email for official communication as secretary.\"\nEssentially, two of the four former officials contacted didn\u2019t turn any emails over because they didn\u2019t have any to turn over. That\u2019s pretty important context.\nAnd what about Powell, who served as Secretary of State during President George W. Bush\u2019s first term? Powell appeared on ABC\u2019s This Week to answers those questions.\nApparently, Powell can\u2019t turn over any documents. Why? Because he doesn\u2019t have them anymore.\n\n"}

{"label": "pants-fire", "claim": "Joe Brown \"Nobody is leaving Memphis. That's a myth.\"", "evidence": "When Memphis Mayor A C Wharton kicked off the budget season by presenting his administration\u2019s plan for financing city government for 2012-13, budget chairman Jim Strickland talked about the possibility that a proposed one-time tax for schools might make more people vote \"with their tail lights\" by leaving the city.\n\nThat brought a challenge from Memphis City Councilman Joe Brown, who is a reliable advocate of increasing city government taxes and spending. \u00a0\"Nobody is leaving Memphis,\" Brown said. \"That's a myth.\"\n\nEven the mayor\u2019s budget document cites the negative migration trend, noting that tax revenues \"have been negatively impacted by years of population decline and decimated by the recent recession.\" So we felt obligated to put Councilman Brown\u2019s claim to the Truth-O-Meter\n\nBrown did not respond to numerous messages or emails asking for evidence to support his claim. It\u2019s worth noting here that this Joe Brown, the city councilman, is not the same Joe Brown from Memphis famous for being a TV judge.\n\nNo, this Joe Brown is the councilman who attracted international attention for Memphis in 2004 when he barred seven Iraqi community and civic leaders from City Hall, citing fears of terrorism. \"We don\u2019t want another Oklahoma City,\" he said at the time, adding confusion about domestic terrorism with his confusion about the origins of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nWhen we contacted Strickland about Brown\u2019s claim, he went straight to the numbers, saying that his analysis shows the city has been bleeding residents at a yearly rate of about a half-percent of the population \u2013 roughly 3,000 more people leave the city than move to it. He says he\u2019s even looked at Memphis Light, Gas & Water data that show yearly declines in customers.\n\n\"All the evidence points to people voting with their tail lights,\" Strickland said. \"They are leaving. Most of the people leaving are middle class and Memphis is losing its middle class.\"\n\nU.S. Census Bureau numbers from 2000 and 2010 back up Strickland. We have tracked this closely at The Commercial Appeal over the years, and Tom Charlier reported on it extensively in a piece last March. Between the 2000 and 2010 decennial censuses, Memphis\u2019s population fell from 650,100 to 646,889 -- but those raw numbers mask a larger story of population shifts out of the city.\n\nOne key variable involves Memphis\u2019s 2002 annexation of an 11.5-square-mile area of Cordova -- which contained 35,000 residents. If population in all other parts of Memphis had remained stable, at the very least the city should have shown an increase of 35,000 from the 2000 Census to the 2010 Census.\n\nThere\u2019s also the matter of births far out-numbering deaths, which all things being equal would lead to population gain. While these numbers are not readily available for specific cities in Tennessee, the state does track them by county. University of Memphis researcher Charlie Santo pointed us to data that shows that in Shelby County, of which Memphis comprises 69.7 percent of the population, there were 145,120 births between 2001 and 2010 and 76,463 deaths.\n\nThus, the county should have added 68,657 people based on more births than deaths, and if we apportion 69.7 percent of that to Memphis, that means the city could have expected to grow by 47,854 people.\n\nAdd that 47,854 to the 35,000 Cordova residents forced into the city limits by annexation, and you see that, had there been an absolute zero rate of migration into or out of the city, Memphis\u2019s population should have increased over the decade by 82,854.\n\nAnd, yet, the city showed a population decline of 3,211 people over that period. So more than 85,000 people that would have been expected to be present in census calculations were in fact nowhere to be found inside of Memphis.\n\nWe also know that the six incorporated suburban cities and towns inside Shelby County grew by 33 percent between 2000 and 2010, adding a total of 41,918 residents. Suburban towns and cities in bordering counties also showed great growth. And in Mississippi\u2019s DeSoto County, which borders Memphis and Shelby County to the south, population grew by 37 percent, with the addition of 43,507 residents.\n\nWe cannot say exactly how many of those new suburban residents came from Memphis, but the Census Bureau numbers from its 2010 American Community Survey reveal substantial migration from Memphis to the suburbs.\n\nThe 2010 ACS, a scientifically rigorous U.S. Census sampling, shows a yearly migration out of Memphis of 32,580 people -- 11,425 moved from Memphis to the remainder of Shelby County, 5,767 moved to a different county in Tennessee and 15,388 moved to different state.\n\nWe did not get numbers for in-migration, because Brown\u2019s comment focused specifically on whether people are leaving Memphis. But the numbers from the decennial census make it clear more people are moving out of Memphis every year than are moving in.\n\nAs Charlier wrote, this is a staggering trend because it marks only the second decline in a decennial census since the yellow fever epidemic of the 1870s.\n\nSmart City Memphis blogger Tom Jones, a former longtime Shelby County government administrator, put it into greater historical context: \"Within the 1970 city limits of Memphis, there are more than 30% fewer people; if Memphis were not able to masquerade its population losses through annexations, the city might well have lost more people than any city in the Sun Belt.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nBrown defends his desire to raise taxes and increase spending in Memphis by saying it's \"a myth\" that residents are leaving Memphis. But he need only look at the mayor's budget document, which says the city has suffered \"years of population decline.\" And numbers from the Census Bureau show a more detailed story of the steady out-migration. It has been masked by annexations and yearly births outnumbering deaths, but it's a very real trend. We rate this claim Pants On Fire.\n\n"}

And since Wagner\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t place a timeframe on his claim \u2014 other than using the present tense \u2014 we decided to see if anyone else had.\nWe found a June\u00a0tweet from Matt Brouillette, current president and CEO of Commonwealth Partners and former president and CEO of the conservative Commonwealth Foundation. In it, Brouillette wrote in response to a tweet from U.S. Rep. Keith Rothfus about national economic figures:\u00a0\"Yet under @GovernorTomWolf's tenure, PA's unemployment rate remains upwards of 20% higher than the national average.\"\nIn an email response to\u00a0PolitiFact Pennsylvania, Brouillette pointed to April when Pennsylvania\u2019s unemployment rate was 4.7 percent and the national rate was 3.9. Brouillette said this puts Pennsylvania\u2019s rate at 20.5 percent above the national rate.\nHere\u2019s the math: (4.7 - 3.9) / 3.9 = .205 x 100 = 20.5 percent\nObviously one could also say that Pennsylvania\u2019s rate was, in absolute terms, 0.8 percentage points higher than the national rate in April, but that number is far less impactful, especially if, like Wagner, your intent is to besmirch the sitting governor who also happens to be your political opponent.\n\"Using a percentage change is not that uncommon, especially if it works to make the point more dramatic,\" said G. Terry Madonna, professor of public affairs and director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin and Marshall College.\nErin E. Delaney, an economist with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, explained,\u00a0\"It\u2019s usually not necessary to calculate a percent change with percentages because they are already comparable as is (unlike if you were looking to compare unemployment levels).\"\nDelaney added, \"... calculating a percent change could be misleading if all of the facts are not presented. Because the numbers are smaller in the first instance, the percent difference is exaggerated \u2014 especially confusing since both of the rates would be more favorable than the higher rates with the smaller percentage difference.\"\nSo, Pennsylvania\u2019s unemployment rate was 20 percent \u2014\u00a0not 20 percentage points \u2014 higher than the national rate in April.\nBut is that still the case, given the present tense used in Wagner\u2019s email?\n\n"}

The conservative religious group opposed President Barack Obama's health care reforms as well as a recent federal hate crimes bill because the group said it provided \"special federal protections for homosexuals that most others do not have.\"In a recent interview with Politico, Land -- unprompted -- brought up Rubio's prospects.\"The longer nobody catches fire, the more space there is for Marco,\" Land said of a possible presidential run. \"It wouldn\u2019t be unheard of for a freshman senator from Florida to be the nominee \u2014 particularly one who was speaker of the (Florida House of Representatives).\"He's got more experience than Obama had,\" Land continued. \"There are a lot of Hispanics in this country who would find someone with Marco\u2019s ethnic background very appealing. Although I like Sarah (Palin), I think Sarah\u2019s got a lot more impediments to a nomination than Marco Rubio does.\"Rubio has tried to dismiss the Internet buzz of a possible run.But that doesn't mean PolitiFact Florida can't dream. Which begs a real question: If the fresh-faced Rubio did run in 2012, would he have more experience than Obama did when he was elected in 2008?To begin to answer that question, we have to first presuppose Rubio 1.) gets elected in November 2010 to the U.S. Senate and 2.) decides to run for president in 2012.If that happens, Rubio will have two years in the Senate plus nearly 11 previous years of political experience -- a little less than two years as a part-time West Miami city commissioner (April 1998-January 2000), and almost nine years in the Florida House of Representatives. (He was elected in a special election in early 2000 and served through 2008.) While in the House, Rubio served in the Republican leadership as whip, majority leader and eventually speaker. A position in the state House is considered part time.All together that adds up to 13 years of political experience.Before that, Rubio's work experiences are thin.According to his official biography, Rubio attended South Miami Senior High School and graduated in 1989. He went to three colleges, eventually graduating from the University of Florida in 1993 with a bachelor of science, and then from law school at the University of Miami in 1996.He then began to work for the private Miami law firm Tew Cardenas. He has worked as a lawyer with private firms on and off ever since. In 2008 and 2009, Rubio co-instructed a class on Florida politics at Florida International University.Contrast that with Obama.During the 2008 presidential campaign, PolitiFact extensively researched Obama's work and political experiences.Obama had 12 years of political experience prior to being elected president -- nearly four years in the U.S. Senate (2005-2008) and eight years in the Illinois state Senate (1997-2004). Like Florida, Illinois' Legislature is considered part time work.\nThat's in addition to his work before being elected to the state Senate. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, Obama worked for a year as a financial analyst, then three years as a community organizer in Chicago before going to Harvard Law School. He graduated from law school in 1991, then ran Illinois Project Vote, a voter registration drive, for much of 1992. After that, he accepted a position with the Chicago firm Miner, Barnhill & Galland. He also began teaching at the University of Chicago in 1993 and was a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago law school while in the Illinois Senate.\n\n"}
{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Erica Smith Says she's\u00a0beating Democratic opponent Cal Cunningham\u00a0and is also the first black, female US Senate candidate to be beating an incumbent Senator (Thom Tillis) in \"every poll out of the gate.\"", "evidence": "For a sign that North Carolina\u2019s US Senate race is tight, look at the polls.\nIncumbent Republican Sen. Thom Tillis at one point last year had the lowest approval rating of all senators, according to one poll.\nOn the Democratic side, two of the five candidates appear to be getting the most attention.\u00a0\nCal Cunningham, who was endorsed by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, raised more than $1 million in the third quarter of 2019 alone. But in the polls, Cunningham hasn\u2019t separated from NC Sen. Erica Smith, who raised about $40,000 that quarter.\u00a0\nIn fact, Smith has polled quite well. In an interview with Spectrum News host Tim Boyum, Smith described her run as historic. And she made a couple claims that caught our attention.\nAround the 1-minute mark of the interview video, she said, \"There have been five polls that have been conducted since this race began. And in every poll, not only am I ahead of the Democratic challengers, but I\u2019m beating Thom Tillis in all of those polls that show a head-to-head match. I am beating incumbent Senator Thom Tillis and I am beating him by the widest margins.\"\nAround the 6-minute mark, she added, \"There has been no one, no black woman of color who has been running for U.S. Senate in this nation and beating the incumbent in every poll out the gate. We\u2019re making history.\"\n(Actually, there have been six public polls. But we\u2019re not going to focus on that error, since it\u2019s likely unimportant to readers.)\nInstead, we\u2019ll focus on her two much bigger claims.\nIs Smith beating both Cunningham and Tillis in the polls? And, is she the first black woman to lead an incumbent U.S. Senator upon entering a race?\nThis is a classic case of cherry-picking. Smith cites polls that are either old or inconclusive to make a sweeping claim that gives a misleading impression. No poll that featured all three candidates showed anyone with a lead that cleared the margin of error.\nAlso, Smith has appeared in only half of the public polls on the race.\nSMITH POLL RESULTS\nPolitiFact found six public polls on the race and only three of them mention Smith.\nSmith\u2019s best performance: getting 46 percent support to Tillis\u2019 39 percent in an Emerson College poll. This is the only poll where her poll victory was outside the margin of error, which was 3.1 percentage points.\u00a0\nThe drawback? The poll was conducted between May 31 and June 3, before Cunningham entered the race. Jason Husser, director of Elon University\u2019s poll, said voters shouldn\u2019t put too much stock into polls conducted so early in a campaign.\n\"At this early moment, the vast majority of voters tend to rely on party labels when answering survey questions about non-presidential races,\" Husser said. \"That will change when campaigns do more voter outreach over the next couple of months. However, almost all poll numbers for non-presidential primaries are highly volatile at this time.\"\nHead-to-head against Cunningham: there has only been public poll. A Fox News poll conducted between Nov. 10 and 13 found that 18 percent of respondents supported Smith, while 13 percent supported Cunningham.\nThe hangup? Nearly 50 percent of people polled said they were undecided. In other words, more than twice as many people were undecided as chose Smith. (Note: in a similar fact check from 2017, PolitiFact hesitated to label a US Senate race \"neck-and-neck\" because a plurality of voters were undecided.)\nThe only poll that featured Smith, Cunningham and Tillis was conducted by Meredith College between Sept. 29 and Oct. 7. It showed Smith polling less than a percentage point ahead of Tillis, and Cunningham polling less than a percentage point behind Tillis.\nThere are a couple reasons this poll shouldn\u2019t be seen as a reflection of who\u2019s winning\u00a0 or leading the race. In terms of counting actual people: Smith had only four more supporters than Tillis, and Tillis had only seven more supporters than Cunningham out of 996 people polled.\n\n"}

Something isn\u2019t adding up here, so we decided to take a look.\nHow Amash has voted\nA spokesman for Amash linked us to OpenCongress.org, a website from the nonpartisan Sunshine Foundation that aggregates voting records.\nThe site also studies which colleague on each side of the aisle votes with members of Congress most and least since January 2013.\nPelosi\u2019s profile page says the Republican she least often votes with is, indeed, Amash. The two have been on the same side of just 22 percent of votes.\nThat\u2019s partly achieved by Amash staking out positions that put him against most of Congress on widely bipartisan measures.\nFor example, Amash was one of only two House members to vote against a bill to reauthorize spending for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to assist local law enforcement agencies in training for and coordinating efforts to rescue missing children. On Facebook, Amash said the bill created federal bureaucracy and the tax dollars would be better spent locally. (Republicans can criticize Amash\u2019s record, but he\u2019s unique in his diligence about explaining nearly all of his votes on Facebook.)\nSo if Amash seldom votes with Pelosi, is it possible he still votes with Democrats more, as Rogers said?

Jim Whelan (D-Atlantic) was among those expressing disapproval.\n\n\"In our proposal, we would have expanded school aid across the board and finally realized the promise of the 2008 school funding reform act by fully funding all schools \u2013 urban, rural and suburban.

They both are.\n\nWhelan's statement was included in a news release about the governor's line item vetoes of the Democrats' budget proposal and Whelan confirmed to PolitiFact New Jersey that his statement was about the governor\u2019s reductions from the Democrats\u2019 budget.\n\nIn that case, Whelan is correct: the governor did cut state aid for schools from the budget approved by the Legislature. But year over year, Christie increased overall funding for schools.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down.\n\nThe governor always fires the first shot in the state\u2019s budget war. In Christie\u2019s February proposal, state aid to school districts was increased by about $250 million over last year\u2019s budget.\n\nThen, the New Jersey Supreme Court ordered another $500 million in state aid go to 31 urban school systems, the so-called Abbott districts.\n\nWhen Democrats unveiled their budget for Fiscal Year 2012 late last month, an additional $1.1 billion in state aid for schools had been added over the governor\u2019s proposed budget. They also put another $412 million in state aid for non-Abbott districts in a separate bill that would have been enacted only if an income tax rate increase was approved for individuals earning more than $1 million. Christie vetoed both measures.\n\nThe increases in the Democrats\u2019 spending plan also did not withstand Christie\u2019s veto pen.\n\nThe governor cut nearly $500 million in state education aid from the Legislature\u2019s budget. However, he left in more than $446 million in funding that will go to Abbott districts per the court order and another $167 million for other districts.\n\nThat aid, as well as the $250 million in the governor\u2019s original budget proposal that went untouched, equals about $863 million. So, \u00a0year over year, funding for schools increased.\n\nWhelan recognized this when PolitiFact New Jersey spoke with him. \"There\u2019s more school aid than last year,\" he said, but argued that the aid still didn\u2019t fully fund all districts.\n\nAs a spokesman for the Senate Democrats put it: the year over year increase \"only tells a partial story, as the only districts being made whole are the Abbotts.\"\n\nState Treasury Department spokesman Andrew Pratt said, \"Everyone would like to see more aid for schools, however there\u2019s a limit to what we can spend.\"\n\nLet\u2019s briefly touch on the second part of Whelan\u2019s statement, which said Christie made the cuts in state aid for schools, \"preferring instead to extend a tax break for millionaires over funding in the classroom.\"\n\nChristie vetoed a bill that would have raised the income tax on individuals with incomes over $1 million from 8.97 percent to 10.75 percent for two years.\n\nBut is vetoing a tax increase a tax break?\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey tackled this issue before and rated it half true.\n\nLet\u2019s recap.\n\nWhelan said, \"Governor Christie slashed school aid in this budget\" and Christie did cut funds from the Legislature's proposal.\n\n"}

Chris Christie sliced spending from the state budget, but the cuts are not as deep as he claimed recently.\n\nIn a speech at the Brookings Institution, a policy think tank in Washington, D.C., Christie said he recently signed his third budget, which he said increased spending on education, while bolstering support for the state\u2019s most vulnerable citizens and making a \"significant down payment on our pension obligation.\"\n\n\"At the same time, I used my line-item veto authority to veto $360 million dollars in special interest spending, so that our budget this year, in fiscal year 2013, which has just begun, is still smaller than the fiscal year 2008 and 2009 budgets signed by my predecessor, Governor Corzine,\" Christie said during the July 9 address.\n\nIn fact, Christie sliced about $86 million -- not $360 million -- from the state budget using line-item vetoes, a process that allows the governor to eliminate or reduce particular appropriations in the budget.\n\nReductions in funds for pension contributions made up a large portion of the cuts. Christie also reduced funding for transitional aid to towns, nursing homes and medical day care services, among other areas.\n\nSo Christie is wrong on the size of the cuts.\n\nHe\u2019s also wrong to claim those cuts had an impact on trimming the spending plan to below the size of the 2008 and 2009 budgets. The Legislature had passed and delivered a budget to Christie that was already smaller than those two budget bills.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office did not respond to requests for clarification on how Christie reached his total of $360 million in cuts, but his office has cited the figure before.\n\nA news release from June 29 -- the day Christie signed the budget -- said that the governor \"put Corzine Democrats on their heels by vetoing $361 million in unnecessary or unsupported spending.\"\n\nAttached to that release were several vetoes of other bills the Legislature sent to the governor\u2019s desk. Christie claims in his veto messages that seven of those bills would have increased government spending by more than $275 million. Adding that amount to the line-item vetoes pushes Christie\u2019s total cuts to more than $361 million.\n\nChristie says in the veto documents that separating the bills from the budget is \"little more than a thinly veiled attempt to circumvent the tough choices required to meet the constitutional obligation of passing a balanced budget.\"\n\n\"Taken together,\" Christie claims the bills \"would add more than $275 million of government spending for the coming fiscal year.\"\n\nSeveral of the bills clearly authorize additional appropriations, such as a bill that increased the amount of aid municipalities receive from the Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Fund, starting with a $66 million bump in fiscal year 2013.\n\nBut others don\u2019t.\n\nOne bill Christie vetoed would have provided towns more time to spend affordable housing funds before turning the money over to the state.\n\nAnd other bills, like a piece of legislation that would have required municipalities to submit economic growth plans to keep participating in the state\u2019s urban enterprise zone program, lacked a firm estimate of potential fiscal impact.\n\nStill, all of the bills were vetoed outright by the governor and were not part of the state budget he signed.\n\nChristie used his line-item veto authority to cut more than $86 million -- not $360 million -- from the Legislature\u2019s budget.\n\nOur ruling\n\nChristie said he used his \"line-item veto authority to veto $360 million dollars in special interest spending, so that our budget this year ... is still smaller than the fiscal year 2008 and 2009 budgets signed by my predecessor.\"\n\nOnly one fourth of that figure -- about $86 million -- represents appropriations in the budget reduced by Christie\u2019s line-item veto.\n\nAnd Christie\u2019s point that those cuts reduced the size of the budget to below 2008 and 2009 levels is wrong.

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Ed Gillespie Mark Warner\u2019s \"record is one of acting against\" the Keystone XL pipeline.", "evidence": "Republican Senate candidate Ed Gillespie says Democratic incumbent Mark Warner voices support for the Keystone XL pipeline but works against it.\nThe crude oil pipeline would extend 1,179 miles from the Alberta oil sands in Canada to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with existing pipelines that run to Gulf Coast refineries. The privately-built line could carry 830,000 barrels of oil a day. Environmentalists say Keystone would contribute to global warming. Supporters say it would create jobs and reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil.\nBecause the pipeline crosses a U.S. border, it must be approved by the U.S. State Department. The department began its review in 2008 and, three years later, determined there would be no significant environmental damage and asked other federal agencies to weigh in. But this April, the department indefinitely delayed its approval until after a challenge to the pipelines route in Nebraska is settled by that state\u2019s courts.\nIn the Senate, pipeline supporters have tried several times during the past two years to pressure the Obama administration to approve the project. After an effort last month was bogged by partisan infighting, Gillespie blasted an email and news release saying of Warner, \"He likes to tell us he supports Keystone Pipeline, but his record is one of acting against it.\"\nWe wondered whether Warner, who for years has said he backs Keystone, really does have a record to the contrary.\nPaul Logan, spokesman for Gillespie\u2019s campaign, said the statement was based on Keystone votes Warner cast in 2012 and this May. Let\u2019s take a look:\nThe 2012 vote\nSen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., on March 8 tried to attach to a highway funding bill an amendment saying that the State Department\u2019s environmental sign-off on the pipeline the previous year satisfied all federal permitting and authorizations needed to start Keystone.\nThe measure, which required 60 votes to proceed, failed 56-42 with Warner voting against it. Warner said then that although he supported Keystone, he thought it should be used as leverage to gain support for a comprehensive energy bill that would include tax incentives for the production of alternative energy.\nHe said, \"...I will not be voting for the Keystone amendment today because, by making this a straight up-or-down issue without taking advantage of the opportunity to put together the beginnings of an energy package, we\u2019re missing a great opportunity.\"\nThe 2014 vote\nOn May 12, a Senate deadlock on a bipartisan energy conservation bill appeared to end any chance the the chamber would consider the pipeline before this November\u2019s elections.\nThe legislation -- sponsored by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. and Rob Portman, R-Ohio -- would have provided tax incentives for fuel efficiency in commercial buildings, houses and appliances. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., favored the measure but was concerned that senators facing reelection this year would weigh down the bill with amendments for Keystone and other controversial energy policies.\n\n"}

Everything else in this bill is discretionary.\"\n\nInside the elections bills\n\nFirst, some quick history. In 2011, the GOP-dominated Legislature passed an elections law that reduced the amount of days for early voting from 14 to eight. The new law gave supervisors a choice of offering between between six and 12 hours of early voting each day. So local elections supervisors had the choice to offer between 48 hours and 96 hours of early voting over eight days.\n\nGov. Rick Scott signed the 2011 elections bill but distanced himself from it after Florida\u2019s 2012 election drew national ridicule. Scott announced his own recommendations for reform that echoed proposals from the state elections supervisors association.\n\nOn April 16, the Florida Senate reworked the House elections bill, HB 7013. The Senate is scheduled to take a final vote on its version of the bill on April 24, after which it will go back to the House. We read the bill and interviewed elections officials, lawmakers involved in crafting the bill and Senate staff to analyze what the bill will and won\u2019t do.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the two changes Smith mentioned.\n\nAbsentee ballot signatures: The bill gives voters a second chance if they forgot to sign their absentee ballot. The bill says they would have until 5 p.m. the Sunday before Election Day to correct it.\n\nAdds early voting hours: Currently, the law for early voting requires eight days and between six to 12 hours a day for a combined 48 to 96 hours. The proposed law would create between 64 hours (eight days, 8 hours each) and 168 hours (14 days, 12 hours each) at the discretion of elections supervisors. Smith said the law would mandate an extra two hours a day of early voting. That\u2019s true -- counties that had six hours would now have to increase it to at least eight.\n\nStill, Smith wants elections supervisors to offer 168 hours, even though many said that would be too demanding and unnecessary, especially in smaller counties and primary elections. Smith wants voters in all counties to have the same access to the polls.\n\n\"I dont give a damn. This is voting. This is a fundamental right,\" Smith told PolitiFact Florida. \"This is what people have died in the streets for, this is what people are dying overseas for. Just because an elected official doesn't want to do their job, maybe they shouldn't be supervisor of elections.\"\n\nThe elections supervisors\u2019 association wrote a letter endorsing SB 600 as \"an excellent election reform bill.\" The association had two top priorities of equal weight: reducing the ballot length and expanding options for early voting sites and hours.\n\nSmith\u2019s claim that the bill only mandates an extra two hours a day of early voting is factually correct, but it doesn\u2019t tell the whole story, said Brian Corley, Pasco County\u2019s elections supervisor and leader of the association\u2019s legislative affairs this year. (Corley is a Republican; his association includes supervisors from both parties.)\n\nThe association was not seeking a one-size-fits-all mandate to expand hours because large counties may need more hours than smaller counties, he said.\n\n"}

Their findings were clear.\n\"There now exists almost 20 years of research on the economic impact of professional sports franchises and facilities on the local economy,\" they wrote, reporting that studies published in peer-reviewed economic journals show there is \"almost no evidence that professional sports franchises and facilities have a measurable economic impact on the economy.\"\nAnd that's for major-league teams. In this case, we're talking about a minor league team, said Humphreys when we contacted him by phone.\nFor example, he and Coates found no difference in economic impact between the years when teams were playing their regular schedules and five time periods when they didn't, due to strikes.\nAnd in a subsequent analysis, they found that having postseason games did not affect real per-person income in a city. Money may shift from one part of the economy to another, but there's no net benefit.\nThe evidence is overwhelming, Coates and Humphreys wrote. \"Economists reach the nearly unanimous conclusion that \u2018tangible\u2019 economic benefits generated by professional sports facilities and franchises are very small; clearly far smaller than stadium advocates suggest and smaller than the size of the subsidies.\"\nThey also noted that in 2005, when a random group of economists was asked if they agreed or disagreed with the statement, \"Local and state governments in the U.S. should eliminate subsidies to professional sports franchises,\" 28 percent agreed and 58 percent strongly agreed.

The stats played across the screen, and the reporter wrapped up with \"the war on coal is over, and good news for coal.\"\nFox News told us they drew on the U.S. Energy Information Administration\u2019s Short-term Energy Outlook report for October. There are actually a couple of numbers there. The one Fox News used was a forecast for 2017. It predicted that coal production would go from 728 million short tons in 2016 up to 785 million in 2017. That amounts to a 7.8 percent rise.\nFox News could have gone with a higher number based on actual rather than predicted output. The government report said that in the first nine months of the year, production was 12 percent higher than at the same point the year before.\nSo if anything, Fox News understated the increase.\nAs for the drop over the past 10 years, that might be an understatement, too. The government numbers show a decline closer to 33 percent.\nThere are a few other things to know.\nPerhaps most important, the government doesn\u2019t expect the increase to continue. The same energy outlook said \"coal production is expected to increase by 8 percent in 2017 and by less than 1 percent in 2018.\"\nThat\u2019s in line with a couple of independent assessments.\nA 2017 report from the Bureau of Business and Economic Research at West Virginia University, focused only on West Virginia coal, anticipated growth in 2017 followed by modest increases until 2020.

{"label": "true", "claim": "John Boehner \"New business startups are at the lowest levels in 30 years.\"", "evidence": "When Mitt Romney was in Rhode Island April 11 to campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, he said that President Obama\u2019s policies were hurting the economy.\n\nTo demonstrate that point during his speech in Warwick, Romney pointed to the rate of new business start-ups around the nation.\n\n\"The number of new businesses started per year has dropped by 100,000 during this president\u2019s term,\" Romney said.\n\nRomney has made this claim in other speeches. In Colorado in February, he was more detailed, saying, \"Last year, under President Obama, there were almost 100,000 fewer new business start-ups than there were three years before.\"\n\nStart-up businesses are a crucial part of the nation\u2019s economy. One recent study found that they account for only 3 percent of employment but almost 20 percent of gross job creation.\n\nSo it stands to reason that one explanation for the slow pace of recovery is a lack of start-up activity. In that context, we were interested to see if Romney\u2019s claim was accurate.\n\nA spokeswoman for Romney\u2019s campaign refused to comment for this piece, so we did our own research.\n\nWe started with an item written March 23, 2010, by our friends at PolitiFact Ohio checking a claim by House Speaker John Boehner that \"new business start-ups are at the lowest levels in 30 years.\" Boehner\u2019s statement was rated True, because the rate of start-ups per thousand people and the total number of start-ups per year were lower than in 1977 -- the date cited by Boehner\u2019s office. But that item was not directly attributing the rate to Obama, as Romney did.\n\nWe called Scott Shane, an expert on entrepreneurship who was a source for the PolitiFact Ohio Item. Shane is chairman of the economics department and professor of entrepreneurial studies at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.\n\nHe sent us a spreadsheet of Census Bureau data compiled by the U.S. Small Business Administration. His chart included the number of new firms created annually from 2005 to 2009, the most recent year that data is available.\n\nThe number of new firms increased from 2005 to 2006 but fell steadily each year afterward, going from 556,899 in 2006 to 403,765 in 2009.\n\nThe difference between 2008 -- George W. Bush\u2019s last year in office -- and 2009 -- Obama\u2019s first year -- was 84,499 fewer new businesses. Although it\u2019s close, that\u2019s not the drop-off of 100,000 new businesses that Romney claimed in his statement. But the available SBA data doesn\u2019t cover Obama\u2019s subsequent years in office, so it\u2019s impossible to use it to make a conclusive ruling on Romney\u2019s claim.\n\nSo we turned to another source of information that has data for more recent years -- the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government\u2019s official source for labor figures. The bureau also tracks the creation of new businesses, but its numbers are different from the SBA data.\n\nWhile the SBA only includes start-ups, the BLS includes all new establishments. As Shane explained, if McDonald\u2019s opens a new branch somewhere, then that branch is included in the BLS numbers but not in the SBA numbers. So the more-inclusive BLS number is generally larger than the SBA number for any given year.\n\nAlthough the BLS number doesn\u2019t correlate perfectly to the number of new start-up businesses, we believe it\u2019s still relevant. Romney\u2019s claim was made as a part of a broader criticism of Obama\u2019s economic policies and the slow rate of recovery. Whether a new establishment is a completely new business or a branch of an existing one, it still creates jobs and contributes to economic growth.\n\nAccording to the bureau\u2019s Business Employment Dynamics statistics, the number of new establishments rose until 2006, when it was 667,341. It fell every year afterward up to 2010 by an average of 40,053 -- but then rose again in 2011 by 29,316.\n\nDespite the recent increase, however, the overall decrease since Obama became president is close to 100,000. In 2008, the number of new establishments was 626,771. In 2011, it was 536,445 -- 90,326 less.\n\nBecause Romney\u2019s campaign would not give us a source for his claim, we can only make an educated guess that he used the BLS number and rounded it up to 100,000. That may be reasonable, but there are still problems with Romney\u2019s statement.\n\nBy saying that the number of new businesses dropped during \"this president\u2019s term,\" he is clearly implying that Obama is responsible. Later in the speech he gave in Warwick, Romney was more emphatic.\n\n\"This has not been a good time to start new enterprises,\" he said. \"This president\u2019s policies are responsible for the fact that this recovery has been postponed...\"\n\nIn a past speech, Romney called Obama\u2019s presidency a \"war on enterprise.\"\n\nAt PolitiFact, we treat these types of blame/credit statements in two parts. We examine whether the numbers are right and how much experts say the person being blamed is responsible.\n\nBut the number of new business start-ups had been declining before Obama took office. The numbers tracked by both the Small Business Administration and the Bureau of Labor Statistics were down in 2007 and 2008, President George W. Bush\u2019s last two years in office. The trend continued under President Obama.\n\nThe decline coincided with the onset of the global economic recession. Not surprisingly, the biggest year-on-year drop-off in new businesses -- 17 percent according to the SBA and 12.5 percent according to the BLS -- occurred from 2008 to 2009, when the recession was at its worst. Obama took office in January 2009.\n\nIn general, because of the complexities involved, PolitiFact has been leery of attributing the health of the economy to the policies of a president. We\u2019ll borrow a quote from a recent PolitiFact National item to explain.\n\n\"A recession that is under way or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new office holder,\" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. (Burtless has provided advice to the campaign of Republican John McCain and contributed money to Obama.)\n\n\"The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office.\"\n\nSo what are some reasons for the drop in new business start-ups? In testimony to the House Committee on Small Business, Martin Neil Baily, another economist at Brookings, said that a reduction in home equity -- an important source of funds for start-ups -- and a tightening of banks\u2019 lending standards are partly to blame.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the recession didn\u2019t just affect start-ups in the United States. A 2010 World Bank study of 95 countries found that \"nearly all experienced a sharp drop in business entry during the crisis.\"\n\nWe should also add that it is extremely difficult to accurately measure the rate of business start-ups. We found one study that showed entrepreneurship rising in 2009 before falling in subsequent years. Another showed the rate rising in 2009 and 2010 before falling last year.\n\n\"No single measure captures entrepreneurial activity perfectly,\" Shane wrote in a commentary last year.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s telling that in 2011, as the United States started moving toward a recovery, the rate of new establishments tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics increased for the first time since 2006. Romney didn\u2019t mention that in his speech.\n\nOur ruling\n\nMitt Romney said: \"The number of new businesses started per year has dropped by 100,000 during this president\u2019s term.\"\n\nMany studies have found that fewer businesses have been created during the recession than in previous years. But we couldn\u2019t find any that attributed a drop-off to Obama\u2019s policies or, for that matter, Bush\u2019s policies.\n\nThere is some truth in Romney\u2019s claim, but he neglected to say that the rate of new business start-ups was dropping before Obama took office. Or that by one measurement it has increased recently.\n\nBecause Romney \"leaves out important details or takes things out of context,\" we rate his statement Half True.\n\n(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Richard Durbin Recent record-low water levels in Lake Michigan are evidence that global warming is leading to \"the evaporation of our Great Lakes.\"", "evidence": "On the same day that President Barack Obama gave a major address on climate change, the second-ranking Senate Democrat, Dick Durbin of Illinois, gave a floor speech that drove the issue home for his constituents.\n\"I believe the environment is a challenge we must face head on,\" Durbin said on June 25, 2013. \"To ignore it is to ignore reality. Lake Michigan, when measured just a few months ago, was at its lowest depth in any measured time in recent history. What we are seeing in global warming is the evaporation of our Great Lakes.\"\nA reader suggested we check out Durbin\u2019s claim, so we will.\nThe Great Lakes take in water through precipitation, runoff and inflow from upstream bodies of water; they lose it from evaporation or diversion. Both seasonal and longer-term cycles have caused fluctuations since the end of the Ice Age.\nOver the past 150 years, scientists say, water levels have varied within a relatively narrow, 2-meter range. But the past few decades have produced some important patterns. Lake levels were relatively high from the 1970s to the late 1990s, then fell swiftly in the late 1990s before settling in at a low, but fairly stable, level through today.\nDurbin is correct that water levels in Lake Michigan were lower in January 2013 than at any time since records began in 1918 -- a full 6 feet lower than the 1986 peak. This is causing worries about wildlife, shipping, recreation and tourism.\nSeveral factors tend to increase water loss:\n\u2022 Dredging. The removal of soil and rock to enable ships to pass can encourage lower water levels. Dredging projects going back to the 19th century are estimated to have lowered Lake Michigan by 16 inches, according to the International Joint Commission, a U.S.-Canada panel on boundary issues.\n\u2022 Erosion. Natural erosion since 1962 may have lowered water levels by an additional 3 to 5 inches, according to the commission.\n\u2022 Diversion. A diversion of Lake Michigan water to Chicago starting in 1900 is estimated to have lowered water levels by about 2 inches, but this has been more than balanced out by two diversions into Lake Superior, which feeds Lake Michigan.\nDredging, erosion and diversion have affected today\u2019s low levels by reducing the baseline level, but because there have been no major dredging projects in recent years, these factors have not contributed to recent fluctuations. Other factors more directly related to climate change, however, may have, specifically:\n\u2022 Low precipitation. In 2011 and 2012, the basin feeding the Great Lakes experienced mild winters, which produced lower-than-normal snowpacks, reducing a major source of incoming water in the spring. Dry summers can also provide too little incoming rain to keep levels high.\n\u2022 Higher evaporation. If it\u2019s hot in the summer, water temperatures increase. Then, when cool, dry air comes in the fall, the lakes\u2019 warmer water evaporates in greater quantities, lowering water levels. This can be exaggerated if precipitation levels are already low. Such conditions prevailed last year.\n\u2022 More limited ice cover. In winter, diminished ice cover can mean higher water temperatures, which in turn encourages evaporation. A 2012 study found that the Great Lakes have lost 71 percent of their ice cover since 1973. However, it gets complicated: Scientists say that greater evaporation in the fall can cool lakes, potentially increasing ice coverage the following winter.\n\n"}

Pelosi moved into the 3,075 square foot space in the new, 18-story federal building in downtown San Francisco in the fall of 2009. It was a significant upgrade, more than quadrupling the rent she paid for her previous district office, and is nearly double the next-highest rental paid by a member of the House.\n\nAccording to the Roll Call analysis, the next highest monthly office rent, $10,600, belongs to Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., whose district office is in a federal building in Manhattan. Democratic Reps. Jose Serrano (Bronx, N.Y.), Doris Matsui (Sacramento) Stephen Lynch (Boston) and Diane Watson (Los Angeles) all pay $9,000 to $10,000 a month for district offices.\n\nThis rental data comes courtesy of Pelosi, who allowed the release of the House's quarterly Statement of Disbursements online for the first time in November 2009.\n\nDrew Hammill, Pelosi's press secretary, said the decision to move last fall was justified because after 20 years, \"the old office was no longer able to meet the needs of San Franciscans in the existing space and the new office will expand office size by nearly a third, allowing better service for San Francisco constituents.\"\n\nThe office is more centrally located, Hammill said, allowing constituents better access via public transportation.\n\nBetter security was also a priority, he said.\n\n"}
{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Hillary Clinton \"I have now put out all of my emails.\"", "evidence": "While all the attention is on Hillary Clinton\u2019s email records, one left-leaning political action committee wants to remind everyone about a correspondence flap from another potential presidential candidate -- former Gov. Jeb Bush.\nAmerican Bridge 21st Century posted on its website a reaction to a\u00a0March 2 tweet Bush sent out about Clinton\u2019s use of a private email account while she was Secretary of State. The PAC pointed out that Bush also had used a private account as governor, and had repeatedly defended his own editing of what emails would become part of the Florida public record.\n\"Media accounts establish that Bush, not the State of Florida, decided which private emails to disclose \u2013 apparently nothing would have stopped the Bush team from selectively leaving out politically problematic emails,\" the American Bridge website read.\nDoes Florida\u2019s open records law allow Bush (and all other of the state\u2019s elected officials) to hand-select what emails they make available to the public? Sure enough, it does, but there\u2019s more to it than just letting politicians self-report emails.\nMail call\nBush famously used the personal email address Jeb@jeb.org for all eight years of his two terms, from 1999 to 2007. He cultivated an open and tech-savvy image by announcing in December 2014 he would post more than 250,000 emails from his time as governor, ahead of a possible 2016 presidential run.\nIn February 2015, jebbushemails.com went live with a quarter-million emails and the first chapter of an e-book Bush was writing about being governor.\nBut there are a few things about the release that sometimes get overlooked.\nFirst, those emails were selected from messages already available from the state archives as of December, so the disclosure wasn\u2019t entirely new. Bloomberg reported Bush didn\u2019t submit all of his email until earlier in 2014 -- more than seven years after he left office.\nThe Sunshine Law states an official must turn in records \"at the expiration of his or her term of office.\" Documentation from the Florida Department of State shows that Bush\u2019s public records were transferred to the state archives several times since November 2007, most recently in June 2014. The last batch is described as \"Additional 2002-2003 emails.\"\nNext, and this gets to the heart of what American Bridge said, is that the messages sent to the archives and subsequently posted on Bush\u2019s website are only a portion of all his correspondence during his term. Bush in 2007 said that he had received 550,000 emails through the Jeb@jeb.org address -- plus another 2.5 million through his public email address -- so obviously plenty were not included in\u00a0the batch of about 250,000 that the Bush team posted in February.\nAs American Bridge said, Bush decided what would go to the archives and what wouldn\u2019t.\u00a0The PAC told us that\u2019s comparable to Hillary Clinton\u2019s situation and is therefore hypocritical.

They are the only Americans facing this requirement, although Uncle Sam will still continue to pick up most of the cost.\n\n"}

The AFL-CIO helped form the political committee and administers it from its headquarters in Washington with donations from member unions and supporters, according to records it filed with the Federal Election Commission as well as press reports.\n\nThe PAC spends money on political advocacy ads, such as a recent online ad that said that Mandel, a Republican running for U.S. Senate, is under investigation for shady campaign practices.\n\nSpecifically, Workers\u2019 Voice on June 19 announced it was spending $100,000 for an ad appearing on Cleveland.com (the online home of The Plain Dealer), the Akron Beacon Journal\u2019s website, Google and Twitter. The ad was a spoof on Nike\u2019s ad featuring LeBron James, which carried the theme, \"We are all witnesses.\"\n\nThe anti-Mandel ad\u2019s title was, \"Witness the Mandel investigation.\"\n\nThis was a reference to an investigation of donations that employees of a North Canton direct marketing company made to Mandel\u2019s campaign to unseat incumbent U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat. The ad says people should ask that Mandel \"come clean on campaign cash,\" and the ad asks: \"When did Josh Mandel know his campaign was being investigated by the FBI?\"\n\nThe problem here? Mandel\u2019s campaign is not being investigated by the FBI. The FBI specifically told us this.\n\nRather, the FBI is investigating employees of Suarez Corporation Industries who gave donations to Mandel totaling $105,000, and to U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci. PolitiFact Ohio separately addressed the same claim when the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee made it against Renacci, and ruled it was False.\n\nThe size, number and timing of donations to Mandel from Suarez employees on June 2, 2011, caught the attention of Democrats and reporters last summer. They wondered whether the employees could really afford the donations and if the employer had actually supplied the money and used his workers to hide that fact. If so, it would violate federal campaign finance laws that limit the size of donations and require the true identity of each donor.\n\nSuarez and his employees have denied wrongdoing. \u00a0The Toledo Blade first reported on the contributions in August 2011.\n\nFacing ongoing criticism from Democrats, Mandel in May returned the donations, citing an abundance of caution. Critics say Mandel\u2019s campaign should have suspected the donors might be in violation of the law when it first received the checks.\n\nThat\u2019s an assertion of judgment. PolitiFact Ohio is interested in assertion of fact.\n\nIs Mandel under FBI investigation?\n\n\"No,\" Andrew Hayden, the supervisory senior resident agent of the FBI\u2019s Canton office, told us on June 21. \u00a0\"He is not and he has not been. What we\u2019re looking at is contributions to both campaigns from employees of the Suarez Corporation. Neither the Mandel campaign nor the Renacci campaign are under investigation.\"\n\nBrown, the incumbent senator, came close to making the same claim as in the Workers\u2019 Voice ad, but he caught and seemingly corrected himself. In an interview with Findlay, Ohio, radio station WFIN-AM on June 21, Brown said of Mandel: \"He is under FBI investigation,\" then quickly added, \"or his campaign contributions are under FBI investigation.\"\n\nEven that milder assertion suggests Mandel is implicated. But you could tie yourself up in knots over Brown\u2019s phrasing, whereas Workers\u2019 Voice left no room for even that.\n\nWhile the ad states in one part that the FBI is investigating donations to the Mandel campaign, it then asks: \"When did Josh Mandel know his campaign was being investigated by the FBI?\"\n\nAnd it had the title, \"Witness the Mandel investigation.\"\n\nWe sent AFL-CIO spokesman Michael Gillis an email to ask about the wording. He replied, \"Any contribution includes a contributor and a recipient.

In doing so, experts say she was able to circumvent transparency and records preservation standards.\nWilliams turned to his fellow commentator, Republican strategist and former Bush adviser Karl Rove, arguing that the email scandal during the Bush administration didn\u2019t garner the same level of media criticism. Thus, the attention on Clinton is unwarranted.\n\"When Karl was in trouble back in \u201807, (there was) no press coverage, just about zero press coverage of this issue,\" Williams said, noting that he found just one Washington Post editorial criticizing the private email use.\n\"Juan, you are in a different reality, and I wish that I was there with you,\" Rove said.\nWe decided to look back and see what press coverage of the Bush administration email controversy looked like at the time\u00a0and how it compares to coverage of Clinton.\nThe Bush email story\nFirst, a quick refresher about what happened in the Bush administration. In March 2007, eyes were on then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales after the administration unexpectedly fired eight U.S.\u00a0attorneys. Congress (recently taken over by Democrats) investigated the firings, alleging that the administration had dropped the prosecutors for political reasons.\nOver the course of the investigation, it came out that some White House officials had conducted White House business over private email accounts\u00a0set up on a server through the Republican National Committee. The White House later admitted that some internal White House emails conducted on the RNC server might have been lost.\nDemocrats in Congress accused the administration of purposefully circumventing recordkeeping processes, while the White House said staffers were supposed to use the RNC emails solely for political affairs, not official business. Comparing the Bush and Clinton email scandals is not exactly apples to apples, but there are some similarities.\nWe looked back at media coverage at the time, and Williams has a point that it didn\u2019t cause the same level of hubbub as the Clinton email scandal. Though to say there was \"zero press coverage\" is an exaggeration -- even allowing for a bit of hyperbole.\nComparing the coverage\nWe did a search through Lexis-Nexis, a research service that tracks news articles and transcripts, between March and May 2007.

(Our files show the requested increases were as high as 16.3 percent. The insurance companies ultimately withdrew their requests, but succeeded in getting increases this year.)\n\nFirst of all, Roberts, as the lieutenant governor, has no ability to block rate hikes. That authority lies with Health Insurance Commissioner Christopher Koller.\n\nMeuse acknowledged that Roberts lacks any authority to stop a rate hike. But he said that she deserves credit for leading the campaign against the hikes, which is the claim made by the narrator.\n\nMeuse said Roberts met with business groups and rallied them against the proposal. \"She was the only public official who went and testified.\"\n\nSo we decided to check on her role as a leader of the opposition.\n\nA June 2, 2009 Providence Journal story about a Warwick news conference reported that Roberts joined business leaders to protest the proposed increases. We got through to three of the five business people mentioned in the story and asked whether Roberts led the fight. All agreed.\n\nJ. Michael Vittoria, president of the Rhode Island Business Group on Health, which represents 75 small and large employers, said there was plenty of opposition to the rate hikes proposal and it probably would have been expressed to some degree, but Roberts and her office successfully focused it.\n\n\"If the question is whether she was responsible for making that happen? My opinion is, yes she was. I'm not saying it wouldn't have happened without her doing it, but I think she was the point of the spear there,\" said Vittoria. \"Essentially, she led the way in terms of getting a number of different businesses together to articulate what everybody felt anyway.\"\n\n\"I would absolutely characterize her as someone who led the fight for the repeal of this increase,\" said Donald Nokes, president of NetCenergy in Warwick, who joined Vittoria and Roberts to lobby against the plan on talkradio. \"It came at a very bad time and it just wasn't something we felt should be accepted.\"\n\nLinda Lulli, an associate vice president for human resources at Bryant University, agreed that Roberts helped rally opposition. \"In think the visibility and that level of involvement of the stakeholders, I think, had some influence on the changes that were made by the [insurance] carriers and their positions.\"\n\nAs for the $150 million estimate, Koller told us in an email that \"the 150 figure was my office's estimate, at that time, of the annual aggregate incremental costs which employers would have paid for health insurance had the rates submitted by the three insurers been approved.\"\n\nOne other important point: Roberts talks about saving Rhode Island families over $150 million dollars. But in employer-sponsored health plans, employees usually pay a portion of the premium. It's the businesses that save most of the money. In addition, many employees do not have families.\n\nFor that reason, when it comes to the verbal claim, the Roberts assertion isn't completely true.\n\nAnd because the words that appear on the commercial make the untrue claim that she blocked the increase, it further undercuts her -- to use the Stephen Colbert word -- truthiness"}

But calls for better high school graduation rates have only intensified as technology demands a higher-skilled workforce.\n\u00a0Results on that front were a top achievement noted by Atlanta school board members last week as they announced that Meria Carstarphen, the superintendent of the Austin Independent School District, is their choice to succeed Erroll B. Davis Jr. as Atlanta Public Schools superintendent.\n\u00a0The school district in Texas\u2019 capital city announced in July that the graduation rate for its Class of 2012 had hit an all-time record of 82.5 percent. That\u2019s a great rate by most standards and well above Georgia\u2019s 69.73 percent grad rate and APS\u2019 rate of 50.87 percent that year.\n\u00a0But is it accurate? And is it something Carstarphen deserves credit for? We thought we\u2019d look deeper into the numbers.\n\u00a0Carstarphen, 44, took the helm of the Austin district -- with 87,000 students, 12,000 employees and a $950 million annual budget -- in July 2009. At that time, the district\u2019s high school graduation rate was 74.3 percent, based on data for the Class of 2008.\nAustin\u2019s grad rate has climbed steadily since then. It was 75.6 in 2009, 78.6 percent in 2010 and 80 percent in 2011, before reaching 82.5 in 2012, according to data from the Texas Education Agency.\nDuring Carstarphen\u2019s tenure, the graduation rate improved most among Austin\u2019s African-American students, going from 71.5 percent for the Class of 2010 to 79.6 percent for the Class of 2012, for a difference of 8.1 percentage points. In that period, the rate improved for all students by 3.9 percentage points, by 5.7 percentage points for Hispanic students and by a tiny 0.1 percentage points for white students, according to district data.\nBut Austin still has the lowest graduation rate among the state\u2019s large urban districts for economically disadvantaged students, at 78.9 percent.\nThe upward trajectory of Austin\u2019s overall graduation rate mirrors that of the state.\nTexas, in fact, has one of the nation\u2019s highest high school graduation rates. Its graduation rate climbed almost 10 percentage points in six years to \u00a087.7 percent for 2012. Only one state -- Iowa -- had a better record that year for on-time graduations, with 89 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Education.\nNationwide, the average grad rate\u00a0was\u00a081 percent in 2012.\nGetting an accurate gauge of the high school graduation rate seems like a simple task. But for years, some states and local school districts were allowed to calculate their rates by more than one method. As a result, any national figure was, at best, a rough estimate, and state-by-state comparisons were difficult and discouraged.\n\u00a0But beginning in 2011, the federal government mandated that all states and school districts calculate their graduation rates by counting the number of students who completed high school four years after starting ninth grade.\n\n"}

And does Rowden deserve credit?\nA foundation to build upon\nMissouri\u2019s K-12 education is funded by a mix of local, state, and federal sources, with state sources accounting for about 40% of the total funds each year, according to the Missouri Budget Project. For decades, Missouri has been using what is called the foundation formula to determine the level of state funding for each of the more than 500 school districts in the state. This in turn provides a state funding target each fiscal year.\u00a0\nAccording to the State & Regional Fiscal Studies Unit at the University of Missouri, the foundation formula has gone through many revisions due to changing economic circumstances, court rulings, and modifications in how real and personal property is taxed in the state.\u00a0\nWhen the 1993 formula was deemed obsolete, a new foundation formula was adopted on July 1, 2006. It determines each district\u2019s state aid by multiplying the weighted average daily attendance, which accounts for low-income, special education, and limited English proficiency students, by that of the minimum amount that will be spent on students in all districts to ensure all students receive an adequate education. That number is then adjusted based on local funding and local cost of living.\nKim Rueben, director of the State and Local Finance Initiative at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told us that the legislature has to meet the total dollar amount determined by the formula for K-12 education to be considered fully funded.\n\"It isn't necessarily uncommon for formulas or guarantees not to be fully funded,\" Rueben said.\u00a0\nThe current formula wasn\u2019t fully funded until 2017 for the 2018 fiscal year.

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Barack Obama \"The Interior Department has only 30 days to review an exploration plan submitted by an oil company. That leaves no time for the appropriate environmental review. The result is, they are continually waived.\"", "evidence": "As anger grows over the massive, uncontained oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the procedure for issuing federal drilling permits for the Gulf Coast has begun to attract intense scrutiny. During a May 27, 2010, press conference, President Barack Obama -- under pressure for the failure to stem the underwater leak -- laid a large portion of the blame on the existing law that governs the permitting process, as well as the regulations to implement that law, which were drawn up by the Minerals Management Service, the Interior Department office that oversees oil and gas leases.\"What's also been made clear from this disaster is that, for years, the oil and gas industry has leveraged such power that they have effectively been allowed to regulate themselves,\" Obama said. \"One example, under current law, the Interior Department has only 30 days to review an exploration plan submitted by an oil company. That leaves no time for the appropriate environmental review. The result is, they are continually waived. And this is just one example of a law that was tailored by the industry to serve their needs instead of the public's. So Congress needs to address these issues as soon as possible, and my administration will work with them to do so.\"We wondered whether the president is correct that the law mandates such a short period for an environmental review.The law in question is the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The law was originally passed in 1953, though the amendments relevant to the Obama's statement were added in 1978.Under the law, a proposal to drill must pass through several stages before it can be approved. First, the Interior Department must choose the locations it will open to leasing. Then, the department puts those areas up for lease. Once a lease is purchased by an energy company, the leaseholder must submit an \"exploration plan\" to the Interior Secretary before exercising its right to drill. Interior Department regulations specify that the regional supervisor of MMS has 15 working days after receiving a proposed plan to rule a submission packet complete. At that point, a 30-day clock starts ticking. If the secretary finds problems during this period, modifications can be ordered or, if modifications are insufficient to solve the problem, the lease can be canceled. But if the secretary finds the plan acceptable, it must be approved within that same 30-day window.So Obama is correct about the law's 30-day limit. He's also correct that complete waivers of environmental impact reviews\u00a0are common. The Interior Department says that in recent years, MMS has granted 250 to 400 waivers annually for Gulf of Mexico projects alone. (The department was unable to provide PolitiFact with the number of cases in which a waiver was not granted.) The Deepwater Horizon project had been given a \"categorical exclusion\" from detailed environmental review more than a year before the disaster occurred -- a decision that is supposed to be granted to projects that are expected to have minimal environmental impact.Meanwhile, on Obama's assertion that 30 days is too short a window to conduct a credible environmental review -- much less a plan to respond to a major malfunction -- many experts we spoke to agreed with the president. In general, then, Obama's statement is on target. But we think it's worth noting that the 30-day limit is not the only factor that explains the failure of MMS to study the environmental impact of Gulf of Mexico projects.The exploration plan Obama referenced is not the only environmental study that is supposed to be conducted during this process. Studies are also required when the lease locations are chosen and when the leases are sold, and they don't have statutory time limits.Critics say that, in their current form, these earlier-stage studies do not include enough detail on the specific drilling locations to qualify as a full-scale environmental assessment. But if MMS -- or Congress, or the industry -- had wanted to beef up these earlier studies as a way of getting around the 30-day limit, they could have done so. But they never did. In their absence, the courts have sometimes stepped in: In 2009, a federal appeals court threw out the initial five-year leasing plan for drilling in Alaska's Chukchi Sea, citing shortcomings in the plan's environmental assessment.Holly Doremus, a law professor at the University of California-Berkeley who has studied the MMS permitting process, called it \"a bit disingenuous\" for Obama to focus solely on the 30-day limit.\"The categorical exclusion has never been formally justified by the short time line, and so far as I know MMS has never -- until after this blow-out\u00a0-- asked Congress for more time to review exploration plans,\" she said in an interview. \"I think rather that MMS has thought, and acted, as if it didn't need to do detailed environmental review at the exploration plan stage\" because it does them at the two earlier stages. \"If that review were more thorough, and considered true worst-case scenarios, it might well be the case that 30 days would be enough to look at the environmental impacts of exploration in a particular location,\" she said.Meanwhile, some say that Congress ought to shoulder a portion of the blame for letting an inadequate permitting process fester for more than 30 years.\"If that is too short for a review, then Congress should change it,\" Gary Wolfram, an economics and public policy professor at Hillsdale College. \"My suspicion is that, as with all central planners, Congress doesn\u2019t know the proper amount of time it takes to review a project.''\n\n"}

But Sanders is relying on the Lancet paper \u2014 which has a cost estimate that is the lowest, in the neighborhood of $17 trillion over 10 years \u2014 to argue that the suite of financing mechanisms he has proposed would more than cover the cost of his health bill. (Funding would include taxes on high earners, a new payroll tax, and 4% income premiums for the majority of families.) Most other estimates place the cost between $30 trillion and $40 trillion over a decade, which would make paying for it far more difficult.\u00a0 So we decided to take a closer look.\nWe reached out to one of the study\u2019s authors, but never heard back.\u00a0\nA spokesperson for the Sanders campaign said the paper is \"similar to 22 other recent studies that have also shown that moving to a single-payer healthcare system will cost less than our current dysfunctional healthcare system.\" (We asked for those 22 other studies but, as of publication, hadn\u2019t received them from the campaign. However, an independent researcher provided us with this related analysis.)\nBut other independent experts were skeptical of the Lancet study's estimate \u2014 arguing it exaggerates potential savings, cherry-picks evidence and downplays some of the potential tradeoffs.\n\"I don\u2019t think this study, albeit in a prestigious, peer-reviewed journal, should be given any deference in the Medicare for All debate,\" said Robert Berenson, a fellow at the Urban Institute who studies hospital pricing.\nSo, savings?\nLargely, the Lancet paper is more generous in its assumptions than other Medicare for All analysis, noted Jodi Liu, an economist at the RAND Corp., who studies single-payer plans. To the researchers\u2019 credit, she said, they acknowledge that their findings are based on uncertain assumptions.\nFor instance, the researchers calculate $78.2 billion in savings from providing primary care to uninsured people \u2014 $70.4 billion from avoided hospitalizations and $7.8 from avoided emergency room visits. But previous evidence suggests that logic is suspect at best.\u00a0\nWhen states expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, providing new insurance to people who had previously lacked coverage, avoidable hospitalizations and emergency room visits didn\u2019t disappear because people could suddenly use preventive care, noted Ellen Meara, a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. That evidence doesn\u2019t appear anywhere in the Lancet paper.\n\"The notion that we\u2019re going to get rid of all these avoidable visits \u2014 that\u2019s not been borne out,\" she said.\u00a0\nThe researchers also assume that a Medicare for All system would pay hospitals at a maximum of Medicare rates.\nThat\u2019s tricky. In 2017, the nonpartisan Medicare Payment Advisory Commission estimated that, on average, a hospital has a -9.9% margin on a patient who is insured through Medicare. (Private pay helps make up that difference.) Some hospitals certainly would be able to swallow this cost. But others would struggle to stay afloat, said Adrianna McIntyre, a health policy researcher at Harvard University\u00a0\nGiven the political influence hospitals in particular carry in Congress \u2014 where most members are sensitive to their concerns \u2014 passing a plan offering such a low payment rate would be politically challenging.\nSanders\u2019 bill doesn\u2019t actually\u00a0 specify the rates at which hospitals would be paid.\n\n"}

But he is not collecting a pension, according to state treasury documents.\n\nThose facts would leave us at a Half True.\n\nBut Whelan is doing what the Democrats wrongly accused Polistina of -- collecting a government pension on top of \"taxpayer-funded salaries.\"\n\nWhelan\u2019s salary as a state senator is $49,000 and he made nearly $67,500 as an Atlantic City public school teacher, according to state records current as of Oct. 15, 2010. \u00a0He draws a monthly pension payment through PERS of more than $2,600 for his previous work as a government official and is enrolled in state\u2019s pension fund for teachers, according to state treasury documents and financial disclosure forms.\n\nWhelan did not return requests for comment. Jason Springer, a spokesman for the state Democratic committee, said the mailer \"accurately reflects the salary Mr. Polistina is collecting and the pension credits he is banking.\"\n\nWe asked Springer whether the committee acknowledges that the mailer implies Polistina is currently collecting a pension -- not banking pension credits -- and if they could explain why they were targeting Polistina for something Whelan is doing.\n\nSpringer said in an email that the committee \"stands by our previous response\" and then repeated claims in the mailer.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe state Democratic committee said Polistina collects \"nearly $70,000 in taxpayer-funded salaries -- plus a government pension.\"\n\nPolistina is paid $69,000 for two part-time, public positions.

The last thing you want to do is have fewer young people (working) at a time when unemployment rates are still way too high for teenagers going into their 20s.\"\nWalker\u2019s characterization of the low-wage population touches on a critical element of the debate over raising the national wage, which stands at $7.25 an hour.\nJust who is making the minimum wage? Neither side can seem to agree on the makeup of those on the bottom end of the earning scale.\nIs Walker right that \"jobs that involve the minimum wage are overwhelmingly jobs for young people starting out in the workforce\"?\nHis statement is in the context of calls for a higher national minimum wage, so we\u2019ll focus primarily on the national view rather than on individual states, 21 of which have higher minimums than the federal standard.\nNationally, 4.7 percent of hourly workers toil for $7.25 an hour or less (It can be less due to various exemptions in labor law, such as for employees who receive tips and others. Plus, many people making the minimum round it down to $7 when responding to the survey).\nThat\u2019s about 3.6 million people 16 or older, based on conservative estimates drawn from the monthly Current Population Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Salaried workers are not part of the mix.\nWomen, residents of the south, never-married workers, part-timers and service employees are more likely than their counterparts to work for $7.25 or less. Restaurant and other food service workers make up the biggest group.\nTeenagers overall are more likely than other age groups to work for the minimum, but even in that group nearly 80 percent of the teens earned more than $7.25.\nHere are the labor bureau\u2019s findings on age:\n-- \"Minimum wage workers tend to be young,\" the labor bureau said in a February 2013 report that looked at numbers for 2012. \"Although workers under age 25 represented only about one-fifth of hourly paid workers, they made up about half of those paid the federal minimum wage or less.\"\n--Teenagers (16 to 19) make up about one-quarter (24.1 percent) of hourly paid workers making $7.25 or less, or 31 percent of those right at the minimum wage.\n\n\n\n\nAge range of worker\n\n\nBreakdown of workers at minimum or less\n\n\nBreakdown of workers at exactly minimum wage\n\n\n\n\n16 to 19 years old\n\n\n24.1 percent\n\n\n30.9 percent\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a020 to 24\n\n\n26.5\n\n\n24.1\n\n\n\n\n25 to 34\n\n\n20.3\n\n\n15.5\n\n\n\n\n35 to 44\n\n"}

And if he had been comparing apples to apples, that might have been a reasonable conclusion.\nBut it turns out, he was off on the logic.\n\nThe team behind the report says Doing Business rankings should be examined independently of each other. Countries go up or down on the Starting a Business leaderboard if other countries\u2019 have improved, if data has changed, if other countries are added to the list, and other factors--not necessarily because the United States\u2019 own situation has gotten worse.

That is a disgrace.\"\nWe fact checked McAuliffe\u2019s statement and found it on the mark.\nMcAuliffe was governor from 2014-2018 and stepped down because Virginia is the only state that bars its governor from serving successive terms. He faces four opponents in a June 8 Democratic primary, all of whom are also promising to increase teachers\u2019 pay.\nRenzo Olivari, McAuliffe\u2019s campaign spokesman, said McAuliffe\u2019s claim is based on an article posted in August 2020 in business.org., a website that offers information and product reviews aimed at small businesses.\nThe article was headlined, \"The Best and Worst States for Teachers.\" It compared each state\u2019s average teacher\u2019s salary in the 2018-19 school year to its average 2019 salary for all full-time, year-round employees. Average teacher salaries were taken from data compiled by the National Center for Education Statistics; average employee salaries came from the U.S. Census Bureau.\nVirginia\u2019s average teacher salary of $52,466 was 28% lower than the $72,833 average of all full-time workers - the largest discrepancy in the nation. That backs McAuliffe\u2019s claim. But one potential problem remained. The Census Bureau updated its 2019 average employee salary figures after the article ran. So we ran the new numbers against the teacher pay data.\nVirginia still had the largest discrepancy or, as McAuliffe says, was last in the nation. The average pay of full-time, year-round employees was $73,890 - 29% higher than the average teacher salary of all workers. Nationally, the average for full-time employees was $67,787 compared to $61,730 for teachers - a 9% difference.\u00a0\nVirginia has the 8th highest average salary for full-time workers and ranks 34th in average teacher pay.

He\u2019s challenging Troy Balderson, a Republican who won the mid-Ohio seat temporarily after a special election in August 2018.

Balderson backs a massive tax giveaway for them by slashing Medicare and Social Security for us.\"\nThese dots supposedly go from corporate donations to tax cuts for companies to slashed retirement programs. Let\u2019s see where they actually lead.\nBasic facts\nThe basic facts on campaign contributions are simple and taken from public filings.\n\n\nBalderson is raising campaign money. Based on publicly filed campaign finance records through Sept. 10, he has raised nearly $1.8 million, with about $240,000 of it coming from political action committees of businesses. Whether that\u2019s an \"avalanche of cash\" is relative, but for the sake of comparison, O\u2019Connor, the candidate making the claim, has raised much more money: $5.5\u00a0million -- but he shuns money from corporate PACs.\n\n\nThe ad\u2019s announcer singles out three kinds of corporations. One is \"the insurance giants.\" Yet nearly a quarter, or $11,900, of the industry\u2019s total came from a single hometown insurer, Nationwide, based in Columbus, mostly from the company PAC.\n\n\nBalderson has received more than $30,000 from commercial banks so far. Yet the overwhelming share of it -- $15,500 -- was from another hometown company, Columbus-based Huntington Bancshares. O'Connor got $2,500 from Huntington's PAC in April\u00a0but gave it back\u00a0in June.\n\n\nBalderson got $14,900 from pharmaceutical and health products companies, records show. But 40 percent of that drug industry money, or $6,000, came from Cardinal Health, a Columbus-based pharmaceutical distributor.\n\n\nThe 'giveaway'\nThe ad then says Balderson \"backs a massive tax giveaway\" for his corporate donors\nThis refers to the corporate tax rate reductions in the late 2017 income tax overhaul.

From his earliest days in politics, he has repeatedly invoked their memory as role models for the kind of selfless, rugged and generous person that he hoped voters would find him to be.\nIt was of little surprise then that, as he appeared with immigrant activists to sign a controversial law putting limits on policing of the undocumented, Rauner retold his own favorite story of immigrants -- the Ericksons from Sweden.\n\"My grandparents were proud immigrants to the United States of America, here to Illinois in the late 1800s,\" Rauner said. \"My grandparents did not speak English when they were young.\"\nVariations of the Erickson story have been staples of Rauner appearances for years. But the key word here is \"variations,\" because the governor has not always been consistent in the telling.\nSo what is the real immigrant story of those grandparents Rauner is always talking about? We decided to check.\nImmigrant cred\nFirst, a little context. Bruce Rauner grew up in the upscale North Shore suburbs of Deerfield and Lake Forest as well as Scottsdale, Ariz., and his father was a high-ranking executive at electronics giant Motorola. Rauner went to Ivy League colleges, became enormously wealthy as a private equity investor and was the owner of nine luxury homes and ranches when he launched his campaign. \u00a0\nHis campaign was clearly sensitive to how that might play with voters as it sought from the first to portray him as a regular guy.\nEarly campaign ads featured Rauner with his $18 Timex watch and a two-decade old family van that he said his children dubbed the \"rolling trash can.\" The Chicago Tribune asked in 2014 about comparisons to wealthy private equity investor turned politician Mitt Romney, and Rauner bristled: \"He came across as a blue blood, I'm a regular guy. I drink beer. I don't drink Courvoisier or whatever the hell that stuff is. I drink beer and I smoke a cigar and I ride a Harley and I love to fish.\"\nCue the Ericksons as a key component of Rauner\u2019s down-to-earth cred.\nHere\u2019s the story as highlighted on Rauner\u2019s campaign website:\n\"Bruce\u2019s grandfather was a Swedish-speaking, small-town dairyman who taught Bruce about fishing and hunting, the value of hard work and the importance of giving back.\"\nAnd here is how Rauner described his grandfather during a campaign stop in Wauconda in October 2013:\n\"My best friend growing up was my grandfather on my mom\u2019s side. Swedish immigrant. Didn\u2019t speak much English. Lived in a double wide trailer in a cornfield outside Whitewater, Wisconsin. Dairy farmer. Taught me to milk cows. Taught me about huntin\u2019 and fishin.\u2019 Taught me about hard work and giving back.\"\nA year later, he was quoted in the Pekin Daily Times this way: \"America's built on immigration, my grandparents were immigrants, and I would like to see us a welcoming state for immigrants from all over the world.\"\nMore recently, when Rauner was interviewed in June 2017 by the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University, he again talked of his grandfather. \"He was my best buddy growing up. He was an immigrant, didn't speak much English.

Gov. Dan Forest told a group of young Republicans that the flu had actually killed more people than the novel coronavirus.\nForest, who\u2019s running for governor against incumbent Democrat Roy Cooper, has suggested that North Carolina\u2019s stay-at-home order might be disproportionate to the effects of COVID-19 in his state.\nIn a video interview, Forest said:\n\"You know, we\u2019ve still had more deaths to the flu this year than we\u2019ve had COVID-19,\" Forest said, adding: \"There\u2019s been about three times more deaths for HIV/AIDS, remember that was a pandemic at one time that still has no vaccine. This one\u2019s bad. It\u2019s obviously worse than the normal flu year, but it hasn\u2019t hit the extremes of other pandemics yet.\"\nForest also compared COVID-19 with HIV. But let\u2019s focus on Forest\u2019s claim about the flu, since that\u2019s what it\u2019s most commonly compared with.\nIt isn\u2019t clear from Forest\u2019s claim if he is talking about the United States or North Carolina. So we\u2019ll address those stats at the both state and national level.\nIs Forest right?\u00a0\nNo. And there are several reasons why Forest\u2019s comparison is neither fair, nor accurate:\n\n\nHe compared diseases that entered the United States at different times.\n\n\nWhen it comes to flu deaths across the U.S., he based his claim on an estimate \u2014 and cherry-picked the worst case scenario from that estimate.\n\n\nHe overlooked data from his home state, where publicly available information showed there had been more COVID-19 deaths than flu deaths.\n\n\nIt\u2019s important to note first that the flu and COVID-19 did not enter the U.S. at the same time. While the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention started tracking the flu in 2019, authorities didn\u2019t report the first case of the novel coronavirus until Jan. 20. The first death occurred on Feb. 29.\nIf the diseases were in a race, the flu got several months of a head start.\u00a0\n\"Comparing deaths from laboratory confirmed cases of COVID that occurred between Feb. 29\u2013April 24 to statistical model estimations of all flu deaths (detected and undetected) from October 1\u2013April 4 is not at all equitable,\" said Dr. Ben King, clinical assistant professor of public health at the University of Texas Dell Medical School.\u00a0\nWith that said, let\u2019s look at the numbers that are available.\nFlu and COVID-19 deaths\nAs of April 25, the day after Forest made his claim, more than 50,000 people had died from COVID-19, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The estimate has grown to 65,700 by May 4.\nSome experts believe the CDC\u2019s numbers to be low. A study released by the Washington Post and the Yale School of Public Health on April 27 found that experts missed as many as 15,000 coronavirus deaths in the first weeks after the virus arrived in the U.S.\nWhat about flu deaths? The CDC doesn\u2019t have up-to-date flu death numbers. Forest based his claim on the CDC\u2019s estimate that flu deaths could be as high as 62,000, Forest spokesman Andrew Dunn told PolitiFact in an email.\nA problem for Forest\u2019s claim? That CDC estimate also predicted flu deaths could be as low as 24,000. That\u2019s a wide range, which has recently drawn criticism.\nIn an April 28 Scientific American column titled, \"Comparing COVID-19 Deaths to Flu Deaths Is Like Comparing Apples to Oranges,\" a Harvard Medical School instructor explains the CDC\u2019s prediction methods \u2014 and argues they should change.\n\n"}

Scott grew Columbia/HCA into the nation's biggest hospital system. It then became the center of a multi-state federal investigation in 1997 that centered around whether Columbia/HCA defrauded Medicare and Medicaid. Scott resigned under pressure in 1997 as the scope of the investigation grew.Paragraph 2. Columbia/HCA eventually settled the fraud cases, paying a record-setting $1.7 billion in fines. The company pleaded guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies. Four people also were indicted; two were convicted, but those convictions were overturned on appeal. Scott himself was not indicted or questioned in the case.Largest fine ever. $1.7 billion. Resigned under pressure.A third-party group, the Alliance for America\u2019s Future, has crafted a 30-second ad attacking Scott's record at Columbia/HCA. And there's a baiting Twitter account, ScottFraudFiles, being pushed by supporters of Bill McCollum, Scott's Republican primary rival.The attacks are being countered by Scott, who has deep pockets and already has spent millions of dollars on television advertisements.Scott launched a website, www.truthaboutrickscott.com, to refute claims about his time leading Columbia/HCA.

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Donald Trump \"Our new (health care) plans are up to 60% less expensive and better\" than Obamacare.", "evidence": "In his wide-ranging State of the Union address, President Donald Trump returned to a favorite theme: the cost of health insurance.\nHe cited the high cost of premiums for people who buy their coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces and said his administration has provided new, less costly coverage.\n\"I moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives. Our new plans are up to 60% less expensive and better,\" Trump told the lawmakers gathered at the Capitol.\nSo we wondered, to which new alternatives was he referring? We reached out to the White House to ask.\nSpokesperson Adam Kennedy responded that the president was talking about short-term, limited-duration plans. But that got us thinking: Are they really less expensive and better? Or simply better than nothing?\u00a0\nFirst, are they new?\nThey are not. As background, short-term insurance plans have been around for decades in various iterations and are generally considered a stopgap solution for people between jobs or attending school. They provide some protections, usually paying a percentage of hospital and doctor bills after the policyholder meets a deductible.\nBut they\u2019ve always been a bit controversial.\nUnlike the ACA plans now available, short-term plans can bar people with health conditions from enrolling or exclude coverage for specific conditions or treatments. They also offer fewer benefits \u2014 meaning they are not required to comply with the health law\u2019s mandated essential benefits requirement.\nSo, for example, they don\u2019t have to cover prescription drugs, or mental health services or substance abuse treatment \u2014 and many don\u2019t. In addition, they can set annual or lifetime caps on benefits. Almost all exclude maternity care.\nIf a person develops a health condition during the coverage term, insurers can look through their medical records and, in some cases, retroactively cancel the plans \u2014 or refuse to renew the coverage at the end of the policy\u2019s term.\nThe Obama administration restricted these policies, which still cannot be sold on the ACA marketplaces and do not qualify for subsidies, to a maximum coverage period of 90 days, down from the 364 days that applied previously.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Trump administration reversed that time-limit restriction in 2018 and built on it by allowing insurers to offer policies renewable for up to three years.\nOfficials, including Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, said at the time that these short-term plans provide an alternative but aren\u2019t a good fit for everyone.\nFor instance, the Trump rules require the policies to carry a warning that they aren\u2019t \"required to comply with federal requirements for health insurance.\" They also state that consumers should \"check the policy carefully to make sure you understand what the policy does and doesn\u2019t cover.\"\nAre these plans less expensive?\nThe White House pointed us toward a January 2019 report produced by the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation as the source for the president\u2019s assertion that these plans are 60% less expensive.\nIt quickly becomes clear that the analysis is very wonky and complex.\nAfter all, it\u2019s not easy to project what benefits insurers will include in short-term plans or what they will charge individuals, which can vary based on their health. Even the analysts called the estimating process \"challenging.\"\u00a0\nWhen it came right down to it, they hedged: Short-term plans are likely cheaper than the lowest-cost ACA plan for some consumers, but more expensive for others. For example, people who get a federal tax credit to buy ACA-compliant insurance or those who are older or less healthy would likely pay more in premiums for a traditional short-term plan, the analysts said.\u00a0\n\n"}

But claiming banks invested in Heck and then received tax breaks takes an acrobatic chronology of what actually happened.\nDonations\nOver his entire congressional career, Heck has actually raised more than the $300,000 amount from the banking industry referenced in the ad. The most recent figure from the \"secruities and investment\" category on the nonpartisan opensecrets.org is $473,819.\nHowever, this is a career-wide total, and it includes the $381,700 raised for his ongoing Senate run. Heck raised $92,119, a much more modest figure, for his other three congressional runs combined.\nThat\u2019s a lot of money, but it\u2019s worth taking the typically massive size of congressional fundraising hauls into consideration.\nFor example, Heck\u2019s $35,472 in donations from the \"securities and investment\" industry during his successful 2014 re-election bid is a drop in the bucket compared to the total $2.4 million raised throughout that campaign.\nAnd as for references to \"investing,\" the tax breaks mentioned in the ad actually refer to a bill Heck championed as a state senator \u2014 years before the $300,000 in donations referenced in the ad.\nHeck did take campaign funds from banks and their associated PACs during this time. A PolitiFact tally found that Heck received around $21,800 from the banking industry through his four years in the state Senate.\nAgain, that isn\u2019t a small figure, but it\u2019s a much smaller amount than what Heck raked in from the state\u2019s casino giants and the medical industry over the same time period.\nTax breaks\nRegardless of the donations, Heck did sponsor an ultimately failed piece of legislation in the state Senate that sought to reduce the payroll tax burden on Nevada financial institutions \u2014 what the ad calls \"$44 million in tax breaks for banks.\"\nThough the ad prominently features a looming image of the U.S. Capitol Dome, the bill would have only applied to Nevada banks.\nWe\u2019ve previously explored the somewhat confusing history of Nevada\u2019s payroll tax (also called the Modified Business Tax, or MBT), created as a compromise to fund new K-12 education programs during a fierce 2003 battle over new taxes.\nState lawmakers historically fiddle with the exact rates and exemptions levels for the payroll tax, but there has been one constant \u2014 banks and other financial institutions are charged at a higher rate than any other business (2 percent), and also pay so-called \"franchise taxes\" for each branch office past the first one in each county ($7,000 a year).\n\n"}

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Chris Van Hollen \"Between the year 2000 and 2006, (insurance) premiums in this country doubled.\"", "evidence": "As the debate over a Republican effort to repeal the health care reform law kicked into high gear on Jan. 18, 2011, Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., argued against repeal and began by citing a couple of statistics to set the stakes.\n\n\"I'm interested to hear my colleagues say that they can identify with all the problems in the health care system,\" Van Hollen said from the floor of the House. \"Between the year 2000 and 2006, premiums in this country doubled, health insurance company profits quadrupled, and this Congress did nothing.\"\n\nThis statistic is nothing new in the health care debate.\n\nIn fact, we first visited a very similar claim when Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., wrote a Sept. 21, 2009, opinion piece for the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call in which he said, \"Insurance companies have seen their profits soar by more than 400 percent since 2001, while premiums for consumers have doubled.\"\n\nAs we did then, we'll break this into two fact-checks. We'll deal with the claim about premiums in a separate item.\n\nHere we'll address Van Hollen's claim that health insurance company profits quadrupled between 2000 and 2006. And we'll borrow heavily from our fact-check of that similar claim made by Rockefeller in September 2009.\n\nRockefeller took his numbers about insurance company profits from a study sponsored by Health Care for America Now. Researchers for HCAN looked at financial data submitted by 10 large, publicly held health insurers to the Securities and Exchange Commission, covering the years between 2000 and 2008. The 10 companies are Aetna, Amerigroup, Centene, CIGNA, Coventry, Health Net, Humana, UnitedHealth Group, Universal American Group and WellPoint.\n\nHCAN is a liberal group that supported the Democratic health care reform efforts, so we checked a few of HCAN's numbers by looking at some of the original disclosure forms on the SEC website and found no notable discrepancies. So the study appears sound.\n\nThe researchers found that the collective profits of these 10 companies rose from $2.41 billion in 2001 to $12.87 billion in 2007 \u2014 a 466 percent increase, meaning that, over that period of time, they more than quadrupled.\n\nWe dinged Rockefeller a bit for cherry-picking years, because, if you used, instead, the years 2001 through 2008, the data show that profits rose from $2.41 billion to $8.40 billion \u2014 a 249 percent increase. That's still a whopping jump, but it's not as high as the increase Rockefeller cited. The general dropoff in the economy had a lot to do with the lower profits in 2008, said Alex Lawson, a health care researcher for Campaign for America's Future, a liberal group, who co-authored the HCAN study, in a 2009 interview with PolitiFact.\n\nMeanwhile, there's another caveat for HCAN's study. The group didn't adjust the profit statistics for corporate takeovers. When big companies absorb smaller ones, the net effect may be to enlarge the profits of the biggest companies (including many of the 10 giants in HCAN's study) even as the total size of the health insurance industry \u2014 the broader entity that Rockefeller seemed to be referring to \u2014 stays roughly the same. While doing such adjustments would have been logistically difficult, and maybe even impossible, the fact that they weren't done puts limits on how this data can be interpreted.\n\nA health industry analyst, Steve Shubitz of Edward Jones, told us in 2009 that consolidation is \"a very large part of this overall increase\" in the higher profits by the remaining 10 companies. \"Of course, these companies have increased profits, too, outside of acquisitions, but nowhere near to the extent that's implied by those stats,\" Shubitz said.\n\n"}

A dozen states \u2014 as Boyle noted \u2014 require no permit.\nTraditionally, states have decided for themselves whether to honor out-of-state permits, a legal concept known as \"reciprocity.\"\nUnder the broad strokes of the House-passed Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, having a concealed-carry permit issued by one state makes it legal to carry in any state.\nAnd according to Boyle, the Republican measure would supersede state and local laws concerning the carry of concealed weapons in school zones.\nBut a close reading of the interplay between the House-passed bill and state gun laws shows that\u2019s not the case.\nThe Gun-Free School Zones Act\nBefore discussing what Boyle gets wrong, it\u2019s worth noting that his claim would have been more accurate if he\u2019d taken aim at federal law, not state law.\nThe federal Gun-Free School Zones Act generally prohibits concealed carry in a school zone, which is defined as a distance of 1,000 feet from the grounds of a public, parochial or private school.\nBut the law makes an exception for people who hold a concealed carry permit from the state in which the school zone is located, according to David Kopel, a policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute.\n\n"}

Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., and Rep.

Now, the group is pushing for the law to go even further so that more workers can take off -- and be paid -- during emergencies.\nAmerica is far behind the modern world in the area of paid leave, said Cycle guest Vicki Shabo, director of work and family programs at the National Partnership for Women and Families, on Dec. 12, 2013.\n\"About 40 percent of workers don\u2019t even have a single paid sick day,\" Shabo said, \"much less the long-term leave that the FAMILY Act would provide.\"\nWe wondered if her statistic was accurate.\nHer source: the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 2013 National Compensation Survey.\nThe data show 61 percent of all private-sector workers were offered paid sick leave, leaving about 40 percent without it.

{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Charlie Smith The federal government could save $500 million annually by circulating $1 coins instead of $1 bills.", "evidence": "You have to spend money to make money. And one former Georgia lawmaker offers that advice to the federal government.\n\nCharlie Smith, a former state representative from St. Mary\u2019s, says if the U.S. really wants to save money, it would replace the $1 bill with the not-so-popular $1 coin. Smith, now an attorney with a Brunswick firm, has been beating this drum for years. He kept the momentum going this month in a newspaper article.\n\nSmith told a Brunswick News reporter that the federal government could save $500 million a year by circulating $1 coins instead of $1 bills, and that there were four studies to support the savings claim.\n\nAt PolitiFact, we\u2019re fond of money, be it paper or coin. So Smith\u2019s savings claim was intriguing. We decided to investigate further.\n\nDuring his 10 years in the state Legislature, Smith was a floor leader for then-Gov. Roy Barnes. These days he\u2019s still leading, but he admits his coin cause is almost unwinnable.\n\n\"They\u2019ve started calling me Charlie \u2018Don Quixote\u2019 Smith because I\u2019m fighting windmills,\" he told us about his campaign to phase out $1 bills.\n\nSmith said he was slightly misquoted in the Brunswick News article. He did say the government could save $500 million a year with the $1 coins, but that amount was cited in just one study. And since then the savings figure has been revised downward.\n\nThe studies that Smith references are those done by the independent, nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office, which works for Congress and acts as a watchdog for how the federal government spends taxpayers\u2019 money.\n\nThe GAO has released several reports over the past decade on the net benefit to the government of replacing the $1 bill with a $1 coin. A report released in 2000 included the $500 million annual savings figure that Smith mentions. But since that year, the GAO studies have estimated less in annual savings.\n\nLast year, in testimony before a congressional committee, the GAO estimated a savings of about $4.4 billion over 30 years, or an average of about $150 million per year. It also repeated a recommendation that the dollar bill be phased out over a four-year transition period.\n\nThe savings included in the studies is based on economics. Coins last longer than paper bills, and dollar coins don\u2019t cost more than they are worth to produce (for example, it costs more than twice the face value of the penny and nickel to produce them).\n\nThe life span of a dollar coin is 30 years. On the other hand, it costs 5.4 cents to produce every $1 bill, which has a life span of 5.9 years.\n\n"}
{"label": "pants-fire", "claim": "Paul Ryan President Barack Obama \"has doubled the size of government since he took office.\"", "evidence": "On his congressional website, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., makes a striking claim that President Obama has doubled the size of goverment.\n\nRyan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, is perhaps the leading Republican voice for a fiscally conservative approach to taxing, spending and reducing the federal debt.\n\nSo when a reader recently pointed out the doubling-government claim on a web page devoted to Ryan\u2019s views on tax policy, we thought it was worth a look.\n\nHere\u2019s an excerpt from the Web page:\n\n\"At a time when Wisconsinites are facing economic uncertainty, a high unemployment rate and a rise in the costs of living, the last thing our country needs are tax increases. President Obama, however, has proposed $1.6 trillion in new taxes on families, small businesses and job creators and tripling the debt since he was elected. At the same time, the president has doubled the size of government since he took office. Instead of chasing higher spending with ever-higher taxes, Congress needs to make our tax code fair, competitive and simple. Unfortunately, our current tax system fails on these three elements.\"\n\nFurther down the page, Ryan adds a bit more detail about his doubling-government claim.\n\n\"Strong leadership is needed in the White House, but despite repeated acknowledgments of the gravity of the federal government\u2019s fiscal outlook, the president seems to have ignored the warnings of his own experts and punted on the (fiscal year) 2012 budget. The budget proposal he submitted to Congress last year continues down the same unsustainable path: doubling the size of government since the President took office, imposing $1.6 trillion in new taxes on families, small businesses and job creators and tripling the debt since the President was elected. This crushing burden of debt is holding back economic growth. President Obama\u2019s budget was defeated by a vote of 0 to 97 in the Senate. We have tried to borrow, spend,and tax our way to prosperity, and it hasn\u2019t worked. The President is expected to put forward his budget proposal for (fiscal year) 2013 in the near future. I remain hopeful that he will work with Congress to address these important challenges facing our country.\"\n\nAccording to the second passage above, Ryan is referring to Obama\u2019s fiscal year 2012 budget proposal -- the one released in early 2011, rather than the current one, which was released in early 2012. So we\u2019ll focus on Obama\u2019s fiscal year 2012 proposal.\n\nWe didn\u2019t hear back from Ryan\u2019s office, but we think the most obvious way to interpret his statement is by measuring the size of federal outlays -- that is, the money spent by the federal government. Ryan is, after all, talking about budget figures.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at the amount of federal outlays when Obama \"took office.\" According to the Office of Management and Budget, federal outlays for fiscal year 2009 -- the fiscal year that was underway when Obama was inaugurated -- totaled $3.5 trillion.\n\nTo look at federal outlays for subsequent years, we turned to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress. The numbers are broadly similar to OMB\u2019s, but since CBO is an independent agency, rather than part of the Obama administration, budget experts suggested that we use CBO\u2019s numbers instead.\n\nCBO concluded that by fiscal year 2012 -- the current fiscal year -- the president\u2019s budget proposal would increase federal outlays to $3.7 trillion. That\u2019s a 6 percent increase -- a far cry from doubling.\n\nIf you take a longer time horizon, the outlays come closer to doubling, but still not close. By fiscal year 2021 -- the final year for which CBO provided its analysis and long after Obama will have left office -- federal outlays would reach $5.8 trillion. That\u2019s an increase of 66 percent, which is still not double.\n\nHowever, even if that figure truly represented a doubling, using the 2021 figure is misleading. When Ryan said that Obama \"has doubled the size of government since he took office,\" it sounds like he\u2019s saying Obama has already doubled the size of government -- not that his spending blueprint will lead to doubled federal outlays at a point five years after Obama\u2019s theoretical second term in office will have come to an end.\n\n\"I think it is pretty clear\" that Ryan\u2019s claim \"in a straight budget sense is false, because it implies it has already happened,\" said Steve Ellis, the vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense.\n\nJust to be sure, we also looked at the figures for federal outlays as a percentage of gross domestic product. These numbers actually decline from 25.0 percent in fiscal 2009 to 23.6 percent in fiscal 2012, and then moves within a narrow range, ending up at 24.2 percent in fiscal 2021. No doubling here, either.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the question of whether Obama would be to blame even if the doubling claim was true. Roy T. Meyers, a political scientist at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County who specializes in budget issues, is skeptical\n\n\"Were all the increased outlays because of Obama's actions? Of course not,\" Meyers said. \"Many of them were the result of \u2018mandatory\u2019 policies in place before he took office, and those policies responded to unfavorable economic conditions -- deposit insurance, food stamps, Medicaid, unemployment insurance and so on.\"\n\nIndeed, discretionary spending -- the line items that Obama had the most control over when he assembled his budget -- represented between 25 and 40 percent of federal outlays during most of the 10 year period that CBO studied. The rest -- a clear majority -- consists of mandatory spending and net interest on the federal debt.\n\nFinally, while we doubted this is what Ryan meant, we also looked at whether the number of federal employees had doubled under Obama. Federal employment has never risen by more than 10 percent above its January 2009 level, excluding temporary Census jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And there is no reliable statistical way to measure changes in the federal government's regulatory burden, said Stan Collender, a former staff member of the House and Senate Budget Committees, who is a partner at Qorvis, a public relations firm.\n\nOur ruling\n\nEven Ryan\u2019s out-of-date budget data offers no support for the notion that Obama \"has doubled the size of government since he took office.\"\n\nAs the House's budget leader and a key spokesman for his party\u2019s budgetary proposals, Ryan should have known better"}
{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Daniel McKee Central Falls \"schools are overfunded by state money by as much as $8 million.\"", "evidence": "The financially-troubled city of Central Falls filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection on Aug. 1, 2011, after receiver Robert Flanders Jr. was unable to get enough concessions from past and current employees.\n\nFlanders took the action because of the city\u2019s dire financial problems, driven in part by a grossly underfunded pension plan for police officers and firefighters. According to the filing, unless major changes are made, the city will have a deficit of $5.6 million by June 30, 2012.\n\nCentral Falls is the first municipality in Rhode Island history to file for bankruptcy.\n\nIn reacting to the development, Daniel McKee, mayor of bordering Cumberland, suggested in a radio interview that the tiny city's financial problems might be solved by shifting money the state is spending on Central Falls schools into the municipal budget. \n\n\"Just on the state funding formula alone, you know that the schools are overfunded by state money by as much as $8 million,\" he told WPRO talk show host Dan Yorke. \"In terms of the student base and the student count, the new school funding formula details somewhere in the vicinity of about $8 million more than they need to operate the schools.\"\n\nMcKee went on to say that \"just basic math says if they're four to five million under in the municipal side and eight million over on the school side, I know if that was in Cumberland, if I added the two together, I'd be running a plus $3 million. I think there are dollars on the table that, on a long term, hopefully the people who are going to make the decisions there are going to figure that out.\"\n\nSo does Central Falls really have $8 million allocated to schools that it could use to cover the shortfall in its municipal budget?\n\nFirst, a little background on the unique nature of the Central Falls school system.\n\nIn 1991, following years of financial difficulties in the city, the state took over operation and financing of the city\u2019s school system. A board of trustees appointed by the Rhode Island Board of Regents now oversees the system.\n\nRhode Island taxpayers pay almost the entire cost of running the schools -- a total of $42.9 million in the fiscal year that ended June 30. (The city pays only to maintain the school buildings.) All other Rhode Island school systems are financed through a combination of local tax revenue and state and federal aid.\n\nNow, back to McKee. We asked the mayor where he got his $8-million estimate.\n\nHe sent us to a web page from the state Department of Education, dated June 10, 2010, outlining year-by-year changes in the amount of money the state was planning to give the various school systems. The web site referred to overfunding for Central Falls schools.\n\nTo understand what the numbers mean, some explanation, courtesy of department spokesman Elliot Krieger.\n\nUp until the mid-1990s, Rhode Island had a formula to determine how much state money to send to school districts. But the General Assembly froze the aid formula in the 1994-1995 fiscal year, opting instead to simply increase the amount each year in various ways that didn't necessarily reflect important elements such as student enrollment or poverty levels. It eliminated the formula altogether three years later.\n\nAfter that, the increases varied year to year.\n\nA year ago, the General Assembly passed a new funding formula that takes into account several factors, including enrollment, student need and local taxing capacity. Under the new formula, some school districts get a lot more money, and some a lot less.\n\nApplying the new funding formula immediately would have been a huge shock to the system, at least for the communities that -- according to the formula -- had been getting far more state money than they deserved. So, under the plan, the overfunded communities would get their allotment cut, in steps, over 10 years. Underfunded communities would see their aid levels rise over 7 years.\n\nAccording to the latest calculation from the Department of Education, the Central Falls school system is actually overfunded this fiscal year by about $14.3 million. The $42.9 million it received during the last fiscal year will be reduced by $1.4 million per year over the next decade, an amount that the state will adjust as enrollment and the city's demographics change.\n\nThat means this year the city is getting nearly $13 million more for its school system than the state says it should need -- $5 million more than McKee\u2019s estimate.\n\nMcKee said that when he cited the $8-million figure, he was trying to avoid exaggerating the potential for savings.\n\nBut there is another problem with McKee\u2019s statement and his underlying point.\n\nJust because the state says a community SHOULD be able to run its school system on the level of funding calculated by the state doesn't mean that it CAN. Some expenses, such as teacher salaries, can remain locked in by contract for a few years.\n\nMcKee argues that things are different now that Central Falls is in bankruptcy proceedings. The bankruptcy judge, at the recommendation of the state-appointed receiver, can make unilateral changes in just about everything, including contracts, and quickly bring expenses into line.\n\nThe result, he contends, would be immediate savings in the school budget that can be transferred to the municipal side of the ledger to solve the city's short-term fiscal problems.\n\n\"You've already got enough money internally inside of that community right now to operate without pestering the taxpayers of the state of Rhode Island,\" he said. \n\nFinally, and fundamentally, it's not at all clear that the \"excess\" money can be tapped by the bankruptcy court. According to Krieger, the education spokesman, those funds are in the state general fund and not earmarked for Central Falls itself. \n\n\"Basic math,\" as McKee puts it, may not apply here. We'll have to wait and see.\n\nBut that issue goes beyond the scope of the statement that we're checking. \n\nIn the end, while he was right about the overfunding, the dollar amount he cited was off by so much, we rate his statement Half True.\n\n(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

Amber Alert is the system that draws the public into the hunt for an abducted child.\nThe Right Scoop carried the message to a wider audience. At around 5 p.m. Sunday, it posted that the U.S. Justice Department Web page for the Amber Alert program was down. \"I\u2019m sure you care about your lost child but Obama doesn\u2019t \u2013 at least not while he\u2019s trying to \u2018win\u2019 the government shutdown,\" the blog post said.\nThe Drudge Report put that item on its homepage with the headline, \"Amber Alert website shut down, Michelle\u2019s \u2018Let\u2019s Move\u2019 stays up.\" By the next morning, the Washington Examiner\u2019s Mark Tapscott had an article titled, \"Obama shutters Amber Alerts as government shutdown enters second week.\"\n\"Somebody, somewhere in the Obama White House or the Obama Justice Department decided to shut down the Amber Alerts, despite the system's long and stellar record of helping locate missing children,\" Tapscott wrote.\nTwo congressmen, Stephen Fincher, R-Tenn, and Steve Stockman, R-Texas, added their own tweets into the mix, echoing the theme that Obama was playing politics with kids.\nBy mid-morning Monday, the government Web page was back up, but chastising tweets continued.

{"label": "true", "claim": "Clayton County Schools \"Clayton County Public Schools recently achieved a milestone that has eluded other\nmetropolitan districts across the state\" by meeting federal guidelines for having a highly qualified staff.", "evidence": "It\u2019s the beginning of a new school year, and for one local school district, that meant time to do some bragging.\n\nClayton County officials recently sent out a press release with a claim that a PolitiFact Georgia reader asked us to read and grade.\n\n\"Clayton County Public Schools recently achieved a milestone that has eluded other\nmetropolitan districts across the state,\" it read. \"When school opens on August 13, Clayton County will have a 100 percent Highly Qualified Staff.\"\n\nThe school district has had some rough times in recent years. Its accreditation was revoked in 2008, thanks to infighting among school board members. It was fully restored in May 2011.\n\nThe district\u2019s teachers had little to do with those problems, but PolitiFact Georgia and others still wondered about the accuracy of this claim. It\u2019s pretty tough to get 100 percent on any exam. How about claiming all of its estimated 3,300 teachers are highly qualified? Another question we had is whether this distinction has eluded other districts.\n\nFirst, what does it mean to be a Highly Qualified teacher?\n\nAs part of the No Child Left Behind education regulations that became law during the administration of President George W. Bush, the states were asked to have their teachers meet certain guidelines that show they are highly qualified to be in the classroom.\n\nTo be deemed highly qualified, teachers must:\n\n1) have a bachelor's degree\n2) have full state certification or licensure\n3) prove that they know each subject they teach\n\nThe first criteria for Highly Qualified status, a bachelor\u2019s degree, appears standard these days. In fact, the bar seems to be what percentage of teachers have a master\u2019s degree. In 1999, virtually all public school teachers had at least a bachelor's degree, and 42 percent had a master\u2019s degree, according to the National Science Board. In 2011, New York City reported that at least 75 percent of its eighth-grade teachers have a master\u2019s degree. \n\nThe percentage of Georgia public school teachers not fully certified in 2010-2011 was 9 percent in math and 9.7 percent in science, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in 2011, citing the Georgia Professional Standards Commission. It seems, though, many teachers have trouble passing the test, which some say is not meant to be rigorous. Channel 2 Action News reported last year that 12,455 teachers failed at least one part of the Georgia Assessment for the Certification of Educators test, 708 people failed five times or more and 56 had failed 10 times or more. One teacher failed 18 times. Some Georgia teaching advocates counter that the percentage of failures is small.\n\nThe Highly Qualified status has not been so highly regarded in some parts of the country. In 2011, a federal circuit court ruled that California illegally classified thousands of teachers in training as \"highly qualified\" in violation of the federal No Child Left Behind Act, The Associated Press reported. The lawsuit, filed by some civil rights activists, claimed more than 100,000 intern teachers nationwide are classified as \"highly qualified.\"\n\nClayton district spokesman David Waller said teacher interns are not a part of its Highly Qualified staff.\n\nClayton school district officials have been trying to have all of their teachers meet the guidelines since 2002 and began to aggressively recruit teachers who meet the Highly Qualified standards about five years ago.\n\nThe Georgia Professional Standards Commission tracks which school districts have met the Highly Qualified criteria. During the 2010-11 school year, which was the most recent year available, 99.56 of Clayton\u2019s teachers and paraprofessionals met all three criteria, the state said. Clayton officials forwarded us an email sent earlier this month from a commission official congratulating the district for reaching the 100 percent plateau for the 2011-12 school year.\n\nClayton is not the first metro Atlanta school district to reach 100 percent Highly Qualified status. In the 2010-11 school year, the others were Forsyth County Schools, Decatur City Schools and Marietta City Schools. Clayton, with nearly 51,000 students, has more students than the others. Other districts in metro Atlanta area were close, said Anne Marie Fenton, the state agency\u2019s assessment program director. \n\nGwinnett County Schools, which has more students than any district in the state, had 99.84 percent of its teachers and paraprofessionals who met the Highly Qualified status. Cobb County also came real close, at 99.41 percent, the state said.\n\nWhile pleased with the ranking, Waller said the press release certainly wasn\u2019t intended to disparage other districts. Waller said he was aware that there have been other districts that have met the guidelines.\n\n\"It was not intended to imply no one else has done this,\" he said.\n\nClayton did meet the 100 percent threshold for this school year, as the press release said. There are other metro districts that have come very, very close, but have not reached that mark yet"}

It shows the net total reductions as $4.9 billion, which the campaign rounds up to $5 billion.\nYet Kansas, not Ohio, consistently rises to the top of searches for \"largest tax cut.\" A fellow with the Show-Me Institute, Andrew Wilson, called Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback\u2019s tax reduction \"the biggest tax cut of any state, relative to the size of its economy, in recent history,\" in a June 2015 article in The Week. (The Show-Me Institute is a right-leaning think tank in Missouri.)\nShawn Sullivan, the director of budget and business processes for the state of Kansas, provided data on Brownback\u2019s tax cuts. The Kansas state budget office projects that between 2014, when Brownback\u2019s tax cuts fully went into effect, and 2019, the cumulative tax reduction will be $3.9 billion.\nAt face value, it would seem that Ohio\u2019s tax cuts under Kasich, at $5 billion, are larger. But the major hurdle that makes the numbers difficult to get a handle on, Davis says, is consideration for population differences between states.\n\n"}

It accompanies an image of a phalanx of helmeted police with guns raised at a suspect whose hands are raised in surrender.\nThe meme was created by represent.us, which was founded in 2012 and describes itself as \"building a fiercely nonpartisan movement to pass tough anti-corruption laws in cities and states across America.\" Its board members range include former Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer, GOP strategist Mark McKinnon, former disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig and D.C.-based think tanker Norm Ornstein.\nWe thought the meme merited a closer look.\nChecking the number\nThe source of the statistical claim was not hard to find. It originated with a study done using an online tool created by MapLight, a website that tracks and analyzes money in politics.\nThe study looked at how lawmakers voted on an amendment to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2015 (H.R. 4870) that would have prohibited the use of funds to transfer various types of surplus military vehicles and gear to local and state police forces through a Pentagon program established in the late 1990s known as the 1033 program.\nThe amendment in question was offered by Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., on June 19, 2014. It failed by a vote of 62-355, but the MapLight study found some interesting statistics.\nThe study tallied up all of the donations to lawmakers from the defense industry between Jan. 1, 2011, and Dec. 31, 2013, using seven categories of industrial sectors tracked by the Center for Responsive Politics. It determined that lawmakers who voted against the amendment took in $53,153 from defense-related donors, while those who voted in favor of the amendment took in $31,240 from those same industries.\nThat means the \"no\" voters received 70 percent more in defense donations than did the \"yes\" voters. That\u2019s slightly off from the 73 percent cited in the meme, but it\u2019s pretty close. (We found an older article on Maplight that said \"73\u00a0percent\"; MapLight staff told us the difference likely arose when a legislator returned a contribution, and the data automatically updated.)\nSo the number is close to the mark. But what about the significance of this finding? This is less certain.\nWhat does the connection actually mean?\n\n"}
{"label": "false", "claim": "Diane Allen Says Ocean Spray is moving its Bordentown processing facility to Pennsylvania largely because of costs associated with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.", "evidence": "Editor's Note: This Truth-O-Meter ruling is the subject of a story found here.\nBefore Gov. Chris Christie announced plans in late May to withdraw from a cap and trade program, Republicans had added a new ingredient to the ongoing debate: cranberries.\n\nIn early May, Ocean Spray announced plans to close its Bordentown facility, where the growers' co-op makes beverages, and relocate operations to the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania.\n\nOn May 9, Republicans held a news conference and issued a press release to call for an end to the state\u2019s involvement in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Under RGGI -- or \"Reggie\" as it\u2019s called -- energy companies buy allowances to comply with a cap on carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nState Sen. Diane Allen (R-Burlington/Camden) cited Ocean Spray's move as an example of how the RGGI was hurting the state's businesses.\n\n\"As a former president and CEO of a small business, I can attest to the impact rising energy rates have on an employer\u2019s ability to add jobs and expand,\" she said in a May 9 news release. \"Just ask Ocean Spray, which last week announced it will be moving its Bordentown processing facility to Pennsylvania, in large measure due to the costs associated with RGGI.\"\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey dug into her claim and quickly found it didn't have much juice: Five news articles and two TV segments about Ocean Spray's move didn\u2019t mention any connection between the decision and RGGI.\n\nWe checked with Adam Bauer, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans, who said Allen\u2019s comments were based on information she received from longtime cranberry grower Bill Haines Jr. According to Ocean Spray, Haines served on the Ocean Spray board of directors between 1996 and 1999, and then again in 2002.\n\nHaines never called us back, so we asked Ocean Spray.\n\nCompany spokesman John Isaf said in an email that higher energy rates factored into the decision to leave Bordentown, but \"not the RGGI program or its contribution to the rate.\"\n\nThe decision, he said, \"was based on a variety of factors -- lower energy costs, improved transportation and distribution (warehousing/freight) logistics; proximity to supply chain partners and customers; lower labor costs; other utility cost advantages (water/wastewater/gas); and a more efficient and modern infrastructure and facility,\" Isaf said in the statement.\n\n\"While energy costs were one of several considerations that went into our decision, and NJ\u2019s costs are significantly higher than other states, we were looking at the total rate paid, not the RGGI program or its contribution to the rate,\" Isaf said.\n\nThat's enough for the Truth-O-Meter, but we thought it was also worth exploring the senator's underlying point, that the cap-and-trade portion is driving up electricity costs.\n\nUtility representatives and experts have an answer: not so much.\n\nAccording to Karen Johnson, spokeswoman for Public Service Electric and Gas, which supplies power to the Bordentown area, the cap-and-trade portion doesn\u2019t affect electricity bills very much for a customer in Ocean Spray\u2019s rate class.\n\nFor the average customer in that rate class, the cap-and-trade portion -- meaning the cost of purchasing allowances -- accounts for 0.4 percent of the annual bill, Johnson said.\n\nJudi Greenwald, vice president of Innovative Solutions at the Virginia-based Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said the effects of RGGI on utility costs have been mostly undetectable.\n\n\"The rate impacts have been miniscule and probably not even perceptible,\" Greenwald told us.\n\nAcross the 10-state region within the RGGI, the emissions cap accounted for between 0.24 and 0.61 percent of average residential electricity bills in 2010, according to a fact sheet prepared by RGGI. That impact represents 46 extra cents per month for a typical household\u2019s electricity usage, according to the RGGI.\n\nIn many cases, electricity prices in New Jersey are based on bids submitted by suppliers in non-RGGI states, according to Peter Shattuck, a carbon markets policy analyst for Environment Northeast. For instance, if a supplier in Pennsylvania, which is not part of RGGI, sets the price, New Jersey utilities are not facing RGGI-related charges, he said.\n\nSo let\u2019s review:\n\nAllen claimed that Ocean Spray was leaving Bordentown \"in large measure due to the costs associated with RGGI.\" Yet Ocean Spray said it did not consider RGGI and its impacts on the energy rate.\n\nOn top of that, a PSE&G spokeswoman and energy experts said RGGI has had a minimal impact on utility costs"}

Under the law, any double-digit proposed rate increase by individual or small group market insurers must be closely examined \"to make sure it is justified.\"\n\nFlorida intended to use its $1 million award to expand its rate review coverage to large group and out-of-state companies; create new premium filing requirements; hire more actuaries; and make it easier for consumers to search premium increase filings on the state insurance regulators\u2019 website.

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Chain email \"Obama has proposed a 1.4% pay increase for active duty military in 2011. This is THE LOWEST SINCE 1973 ... A LOWER PAY INCREASE THAN WELFARE RECIPIENTS!!!\"", "evidence": "Here at PolitiFact, we're huge fans of social media. So when readers requested we check a claim that had gone viral over Facebook, we jumped at the chance.Here's what they sent us:\"Obama has proposed a 1.4% pay increase for active duty military in 2011. This is THE LOWEST SINCE 1973! Nice to know that during a time of rampant inflation, while war is fought in 2 theatres, our men and women in uniform get A LOWER PAY INCREASE THAN WELFARE RECIPIENTS!!! Please repost if you support our troops\"This is a first for us; the claim is part status update, part chain e-mail. To check this claim, it's important to understand how the government typically treats military pay raises. By law, the administration is required to propose pay increases that match increases in the Employment Cost Index, a quarterly economic report that details changes in the costs of labor for businesses. Military pay is tied to this measure to ensure that pay keeps up with salaries in the private sector. Now, while the administration is required to match the ECI, the law does give the president some discretion. In national emergencies or \"serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare\" the president can propose an alternative pay adjustment up or down. In fact, the last president to use this authority was Bill Clinton, who actually proposed no pay increase for the military in 1994, according to Colonel Michael Hayden, deputy director of government relations for the Military Officers Association of America. But Congress ultimately approved a 2.2 percent increase.Obama recently released his budget for 2011, and it included a 1.4 percent pay raise for military personnel, which, again, is in line with the ECI. Clearly, that's lower than the 2.9 percent increase Obama requested last year. But that's because wages and salaries in the private sector only increased 1.4 percent during 2009, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which collects and publishes the data. It's the smallest percentage change since the BLS started collecting such data in 1975. So, it's true that Obama has proposed a 1.4 percent pay increase for the military in 2011. By law, it's what he was required to propose. In fact, because the pay raises come out of the Department of Defense budget, it has asked Congress not to exceed the 1.4 percent pay raise, because the department needs those funds for other programs, including $50 billion to fully fund the Defense Health Program and sustain benefits for about 9.5 million beneficiaries, $2.2 billion for the care of wounded soldiers, and a $500 million increase in funding for family support programs, according to the Department of Defense.But the smallest since 1973, as the Facebook message suggests? It seems that number came from news reports that, if approved, the pay increase would be the smallest since the military became an all-volunteer force in 1973 and military pay rates were overhauled to match private sector pay for civilian workers with similar skills, education and experience. So, setting 1973 as the benchmark sets up a reasonable comparison. But Hayden also sent us the a copy of page 51 of the Fifth Edition of the the Military Compensation Background Papers, which includes data going as far back as 1945. According to that document, military personnel got no pay increase in 1962, making Obama's proposal the smallest since then. The last part of the claim -- that the military pay increase is lower than what welfare recipients are getting this year -- was nearly impossible to sort out. That's because the term \"welfare\" refers to an array of programs, including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Medicaid, the Child Nutrition Program and food stamps. Many of these programs are administered by the states. For example, with TANF the federal government gives block grants to states, which use these funds to operate low-income benefits. That funding has not increased since 1996, according to Liz Schott, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.It's worth noting that the food stamp program got a funding boost in the stimulus bill; the legislation allocated $295 million to states to administer the program and a $19.9 billion temporary benefits increase for recipients. But Congress doesn't approve an annual \"pay increase\" for welfare recipients as it does for the military. So, there's really no comparison.So, this viral Facebook update is correct that Obama proposed a 1.4 percent pay increase for military personnel in 2011. Depending on the time frame, it's the smallest since 1973 or 1962. But there are some big inaccuracies about this claim as well. First and foremost, there's really no such thing as a pay increase for welfare recipients, so it's impossible to compare military pay to support for low-income communities. Furthermore, the claim leaves out important details about why Obama chose a 1.4 percent pay increase; in short, he's required to by law. And while Congress can approve a larger number -- and under extenuating circumstances, the president can propose an alternative pay raise -- the administration is discouraging Congress from doing so in order to keep other military programs, such as health care, well funded"}

{"label": "false", "claim": "Bloggers Sheldon Whitehouse and 18 other senators \"voted to censor the internet.\"", "evidence": "As the WikiLeaks\u00a0 controversy rages and concerns about web censorship in China percolate, another Internet debate has erupted closer to home.\n\nBloggers, legal scholars, tech gurus and a host of others have accused 19 U.S. senators, Rhode Island's Sheldon Whitehouse among them, of voting to censor the Internet.\n\nThe claims are intense -- hundreds of them sprinkled all over the Internet -- and they are angry.\n\nThe vote they're talking about happened Nov. 18, when the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously approved the \"Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act,\" a bill they say would help the Justice Department crack down on websites that \"sell or distribute\" counterfeit or illegally copied goods, such as music or prescription medication.\n\nIf passed, the law would allow the U.S. attorney general to seek a court order to block a web address \"dedicated to infringing activities,\" in other words, sites whose only function is to traffic in counterfeit or unauthorized goods. If and only if a judge were to agree, the federal government could order the Internet provider to essentially remove that site from public view. The site wouldn't actually be gone. It would still be available through its I.P. address, a numerical identification code, for users savvy enough to find it that way.\n\nThe goal of the infringement bill is to curb online piracy and protect intellectual property by policing sites that violate the policy, according to its co-sponsor and Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.\n\n\"Rogue websites are essentially digital stores selling illegal and sometimes dangerous products. If they existed in the physical world, the store would be shuttered immediately and the proprietors arrested,\" Leahy wrote in a Dec. 7 commentary in The Hill, a congressional publication. \"There is no excuse for this behavior simply because it happens online and owners operate overseas. The internet needs to be free -- not lawless.\"\n\nThe bill awaits consideration by the full Senate, which probably won't take up the issue before the lame-duck session ends.\n\nBut that didn't stop the buzz on the blogosphere. That same day, Wired.com posted a story under the headline \"Web censorship bill sails through Senate committee.\" Techdirt, a leading technology blog, offered its own version: \"The 19 Senators who voted to censor the Internet.\"\n\nButtressing those allegations was a strongly worded letter to the committee from a group of 49 prominent law professors who offered a grim assessment: \"For the first time, the United States would be requiring Internet service providers to block speech because of its content.\"\n\nFirst amendment groups and others expressed similar opposition.\n\nThe bill may be meant to target counterfeiters and pirates, but skeptics say they worry that, regardless of the original intent, it could create a framework that might one day allow zealous judges to block sites such as YouTube and Facebook, where users may unwittingly share copyrighted material. The threat to free speech is hard to ignore, they say.\n\n\"The genesis of law is to go after the worst of the worst offenders, but I fear it\u2019s going to lead to Internet censorship down the line,\" said David L. Hudson Jr., a scholar at the First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University.\n\nThose opposed say the legislation would also allow the Justice Department to blacklist websites with limited judicial review, blocking access to them through \"prior restraint\" before it is determined that the site is operating unlawfully.\n\nAbove all, critics say the bill threatens the very freedoms that make the Internet's flow of ideas so valuable.\n\n\"One thing people are really worried about is a worst case scenario -- for example, a politically biased AG using the bill if it became law to shut down a website just because he or she doesn\u2019t agree with it,\" said Roger Williams University School of Law Assistant Prof. Zoe Argento, who was among the professors who signed the letter to Congress.\n\nArgento cited the potential example of a blogger reprinting large portions of former President George W. Bush's new memoir for the purposes of criticizing it. A politically motivated attorney general could use the law to block the website, as opposed to going through the traditional process of a legal challenge where both sides are heard.\n\nOn the other side of this very heated issue, supporters, among them the entertainment industry and even the American Newspaper Association, say something must be done to protect intellectual property from online thieves. As of now, there are only a few means of recourse against such infringement: going after the individuals -- college students, etc. -- who purchased counterfeit materials, or by suing Internet service providers, thereby engaging in a protracted civil court battle. \u00a0\n\nThe infringement legislation, they say, will allow them to use the federal justice system to go straight to the source of a costly problem.\n\nThey dismiss concerns about the bill's so-called slippery slope, stressing the rigorous judicial review that all cases would have to undergo to ensure that the law applies. Websites can be blocked only if the U.S. attorney general can prove that it\u00a0 \"has no demonstrable, commercially significant purpose or use other than\" to traffic in infringed or counterfeit goods.\n\nIn instances when copyrighted material has been stolen, the original, legitimate site will not be touched. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"The law is meant to go after offenders who are the worst of the worst violators of intellectual property law. They are profiting off others work and the Supreme Court has held that such violations are not protected speech,\" said Matt Thornton, a spokesman for Whitehouse.\n\nLeahy in his commentary piece agreed. \"Some have argued the conduct should be excused as free speech because it happens on the Internet,\" he wrote. \"That argument contradicts the basic tenet of copyright law, which, as Justice [Sandra Day] O'Connor explained, is the very 'engine of free expression.' \"\n\nEven if you believe the bill is flawed, said Villanova School of Law Associate Prof. Michael Risch, \"when you view it in the most technical way, it's not censorship because the website is still up, you can still get to it through the I.P. address.\"\n\nNow back to the initial claim. It's clear the 19 senators voted unanimously to approve the bill, but does that constitute censoring the Internet? We argue that it does not. Censorship is defined as the deletion of speech or content considered objectionable. For example, when the Chinese blocked websites related to Tiananmen Square, that was censorship.\n\nIn this case, the sites this law could be applied to do not offer free speech of any kind, they distribute stolen or counterfeit goods. Even if you don't agree with that interpretation, consider what Hudson of the First Amendment Center told us: \"I fear it\u2019s going to lead to Internet censorship down the line.\"\n\nThe key there is the phrase \"down the line.\" That may well be true. The threat of censorship could loom. But we simply do not know that for sure. And that was not the intention of the senators who voted in favor of the bill.\n\nHad the bloggers proclaimed that the vote \"could lead to censorship,\" they'd be offering an opinion and we'd let them off the hook. But they didn't qualify their statements. They made bold allegations that relied on conjecture, not fact, thereby declaring that the bill will immediately censor the Internet.\n\nIt will not"}

Bernie Sanders \u2014 so we decided to head to the Truth-O-Meter with the ad\u2019s claim that Clinton gave speeches to banks \"who paid her over $1 million and are contributing millions more to elect her.\"\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Future45 has taken in hundreds of thousands of dollars from individuals in the financial industry \u2014 including a $250,000 donation from Kenneth Griffin, CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and another $250,000 from Paul Singer, founder of hedge fund Elliott Associates. The PAC has spent more than $600,000 against Clinton so far this cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics\u2019 OpenSecrets website. \u00a0\nSpeaking fees\nClinton has delivered several dozen paid speeches for various corporations, professional associations and financial institutions since she left the State Department in 2013, making upwards of $200,000 for nearly every appearance\nBased on records released by her campaign, we found that she made nearly $4 million speaking to financial services firms. She earned about half of that money speaking to big Wall Street banks like Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, UBS, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs, where she spoke three times in 2013, each appearance raking in $225,000.\nWe don\u2019t have many details regarding what Clinton talked about in those speeches. As the Future45 ad points out, she has declined to release transcripts until other candidates release transcripts from their own paid speeches.\nIn any case, she has earned several million dollars in speaking fees from banks. Now on to her campaign contributions.\nCampaign contributions\nClinton\u2019s campaign and outside groups working on her behalf have received millions of dollars from Wall Street, $23.5 million to be exact, according to her OpenSecrets file. (If you\u2019re browsing the file yourself, we combined donations from securities and investment with miscellaneous finance.)\nIn total, almost $190 million has been raised to support her election, so the amount coming from the financial sector accounts for about 12 percent of all campaign and outside group funds. \u00a0\nMost of that money goes to outside groups working on Clinton\u2019s behalf. The top-five\u00a0organizations contributing to those groups are in the financial sector: Soros Fund Management ($7 million), Euclidian Capital ($3.5 million), Pritzker Group ($2.8 million), Paloma Partners ($2.5 million)\u00a0and Saban Capital Group ($2.5 million).\nTo be clear: The money doesn\u2019t come from the firms themselves. Rather it comes from individual employees or members of the organizations, or the organizations\u2019 political action committees.\nThe Future45 ad, though, makes it seem like the big banks that paid Clinton for speeches are the same ones that are donating millions to elect her. Not so, at least not yet.\nOpenSecrets ran some numbers for us and found that donors from these five big Wall Street banks \u2014 Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, UBS, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs \u2014 have contributed a combined $628,435 to her campaign and allied outside groups so far. That\u2019s far less than \"millions.\"\nClinton has received more money from the financial sector than any of the remaining candidates.\n\n\n\n\nCandidate\n\n\nTotal money raised (campaign and outside groups)\n\n\nTotal money raised from the financial sector\n\n"}
{"label": "false", "claim": "John Boehner The Bush tax cuts \"created about 8 million jobs over the first 10 years that they were in existence. We've lost about 5 million of those jobs during this recession.\"", "evidence": "During an interview on NBC\u2019s Today show, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, offered some job-creation statistics to cast a favorable light on the tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003.\n\nHost Matt Lauer said to Boehner, \"You talk about creating jobs. When the Bush era tax cuts were passed in 2001, unemployment in this country was 4.5 percent. Today it's at 9 percent, just down from 10 percent. So why are the Bush era tax cuts creating jobs?\"\n\nBoehner responded that the tax cuts \"created about 8 million jobs over the first 10 years that they were in existence. We've lost about 5 million of those jobs during this recession.\"\n\nSeveral readers suggested that we check Boehner\u2019s statistics. So we did.\n\nBoehner's statement actually has several problems. One is the question of whether the tax cuts actually caused the job growth; more on that later. First, we\u2019ll point out something more basic -- that Boehner\u2019s chronology is off.\n\nThe first of the tax cuts was passed in June 2001, so we haven\u2019t hit a full 10 years since the first cut was enacted, and we\u2019re only about eight years past the enactment of the second round of cuts. We\u2019ll give Boehner the most generous parameters possible -- from the signing of the first tax cut in June 2001 until the pre-recession employment peak, which came in January 2008. (When we contacted Boehner\u2019s office, they confirmed that this is the comparison he had in mind.)\n\nWe turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- specifically, figures from the Current Employment Statistics series, which is calculated using a broad survey of employer payroll data. Here are the numbers:\n\nJune 2001: 132,047,000 people employed\nJanuary 2008: 137,996,000 people employed\nIncrease during that six-and-a-half-year period: 5,949,000 people \n\nThat\u2019s roughly 6 million jobs -- significantly below the 8 million Boehner cited.\n\nNow let\u2019s turn to the jobs lost during the recession. We once again calculated the numbers in the way most favorable to Boehner -- from the peak of employment (January 2008) to the lowest point (February 2010). Here are the figures:\n\nJanuary 2008: 137,996,000 people employed\nFebruary 2010: 129,246,000 people employed\nDecrease during the roughly two-year period: 8,750,000 people \n\nThat\u2019s almost 9 million jobs lost -- almost twice what Boehner had said on Today.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on?\n\nWhen we reached Boehner\u2019s office, spokesman Michael Steel provided a different set of numbers -- numbers that we determined were from a different set of BLS statistics, known as the Current Population Survey.\n\nThe numbers from the CPS data are produced by a smaller survey of individuals and families. They are best known for producing the widely tracked national unemployment rate, but the data also include an estimate of the raw number of employed Americans, which is what Boehner used.\n\nHere are the CPS figures for the same periods we looked at above:\n\nJune 2001: 136,873,000 people employed\nJanuary 2008: 146,407,000 people employed\nIncrease over about six and a half years: 9,534,000 people \n\nJanuary 2008: 146,407,000 people employed\nFebruary 2010: 138,698,000 people employed\nDecrease over about two years: 7,709,000 people \n\nSo using the CPS figures, Boehner actually underestimated the jobs created after the passage of the Bush tax cuts, rather than overestimating them. And his number of jobs lost in the recession was closer to the CPS number than to the CES number.\n\nIn other words, using one set of data, Boehner\u2019s way off, and using another set, he\u2019s closer. What gives?\n\nFor the periods studied, the two data sets\u2019 varying methodologies appear to have produced large differences in the number of jobs created and lost. While both statistics have their advantages and disadvantages, the CES numbers are \"usually preferred when talking about job growth or loss,\" said Stacey Standish, a BLS spokeswoman.\n\nAnd there\u2019s this problem: What if we had used Boehner's 10 year figure rather than the six-and-a-half-year upswing of jobs? Over the full 10 years, employment has actually fallen by more than 1 million jobs using CES numbers and risen by 2.8 million according to the CPS figures. Either way, both figures are well below the job gains Boehner touted for the full 10-year period.\n\n"}

{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Rand Paul \"Income inequality is worse in towns run by Democrat mayors than in towns run by Republican mayors.\"", "evidence": "During a recent interview with NPR, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., took aim at the belief -- widely held among Democrats -- that Republican policies are encouraging greater income inequality.\n\"I think inequality can be a problem, and interestingly seems to be getting a little bit worse under this administration,\" Paul said. \"Income inequality is worse in towns run by Democrat mayors than in towns run by Republican mayors.\" (Here\u2019s the full transcript.)\nA reader asked us to check whether Paul\u2019s claim about cities under Democratic and Republican mayors is correct. So we did.\nWe located a study by the Brookings Institution released earlier this year that ranked the top 10 and bottom 10 cities by income inequality -- and there does appear to be something to what Paul said.\nOf the study\u2019s 10 most unequal cities, nine have Democratic mayors. They are Atlanta, San Francisco, Boston, Washington, New York, Oakland, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Baltimore. Of the 10 most unequal cities, only Miami has a Republican mayor.\nBy contrast, seven of the 10 most equal cities have Republican mayors -- Oklahoma City; Omaha, Neb.; Fort Worth, Texas; Colorado Springs, Colo.; Mesa, Ariz.; Arlington, Texas; and Virginia Beach, Va. The other three either have a nonpartisan mayor (Raleigh, N.C., and Las Vegas) or a Democrat (Wichita, Kan.).\nSo on the numbers, Paul has a point. The question is, does this discovery mean anything? Experts we spoke to urged taking the claim with a grain of salt -- if not a whole shaker. Here are a few reasons why.\nMayors aren\u2019t all-powerful players in the local economy.\nWhere claims of this sort are made, PolitiFact tries to establish whether credit or blame is deserved. In this case, then, is it reasonable to attribute patterns of inequality exclusively, or even primarily, to a mayor?\nNo -- many factors play into a city\u2019s economic success. The mayor of Detroit doesn\u2019t have much power over the international market for automobiles, and no mayor of New York can take all the credit for the economic juggernaut of Wall Street. While mayoral policies may have an effect on the margins, such factors as the state and national business cycle, broad demographic patterns and international business trends tend to have a much greater impact on economic inequality in cities.\nIn addition, it\u2019s worth remembering that \"cities attract people on the basis of many factors, of which the party of their political leaders is probably a minor one,\" said William Frey, a senior fellow in Brookings\u2019 Metropolitan Policy Program.\nInequality patterns in cities may be at least as much about population size and geographic patterns as they are about partisan leadership.\nFocusing on the partisan differences obscures a more fundamental difference between the most and least unequal cities. The more unequal cities tend to be very big, and the less unequal cities tend to be more modestly sized.\nThe median population of the 10 most unequal cities on the Brookings list is about 630,000, compared to about 430,000 for the most equal cities. (If you used the mean, rather than the median, the average population of the 10 most unequal cities would be even higher -- almost 1.9 million residents per city.) So it\u2019s not exactly apples-to-apples if you compare the attributes of New York, Los Angeles and Chicago on the one hand with those of Colorado Springs, Virginia Beach and Arlington on the other.\n\n"}

They come to the ribbon cuttings.\"", "evidence": "Whoa, talk about a change in tune. Are Republicans now trying to take credit for parts of the health care bill? Are the Yankees rooting for the Red Sox? Are dogs and cats getting along?\n\nIn an Aug. 12, 2010, op-ed for Politico headlined \"GOP touts preventive care it opposed,\" Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., and Rosa DeLauro , D-Conn., touted the benefits of preventive and wellness care. As survivors of breast and ovarian cancer, respectively, they said that preventive care saved their lives. But if Republicans have their way, the Democrats said, they would roll back a provision of the Affordable Care Act that requires no co-pay for preventive care \u2014 including cancer screenings, health checkups, flu shots, mammograms and immunizations.\n\nThat's pretty standard fare from Democratic supporters of the health care bill. But here's the part of the op-ed that caught our attention:\n\n\"Even Republicans who voted against the health care reform law and went out of their way to prevent its passage have now lauded these reforms. Recently, on the Senate floor, Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) actually took credit for the preventive care provision. 'One of the things we did in the health care legislation,' Kyl said, 'was to provide a lot of different incentives for preventive care.'\"\n\nAnd, they wrote, \"This is not the first time Republicans have taken credit for health care provisions that they had tried to derail. After the act passed, and every Republican attempt to gut the bill had failed, House Minority Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio) took credit for provisions that banned the practice of rescissions \u2014 dropping people\u2019s health coverage when they get sick \u2014 and allowed young adults to continue being covered by their parents\u2019 plans until age 26.\n\n\"To paraphrase President John F. Kennedy, success has a thousand fathers, while defeat is an orphan. So we understand why Republicans now like to laud health care reform \u2014 particularly when one considers that, after a decade of congressional control with eight years holding the White House as well, they had failed to do anything about the issue.\"\n\nThat Republicans are now lauding the health care bill was news to us. So we decided to check out the two examples cited in the op-ed.\n\nKyl's comments about preventive care came from the Senate floor on July 12, 2010. The topic was the White House's controversial recess appointment of Dr. Donald M. Berwick as Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\nHere's what Kyl said:\n\n\"Dr. Berwick expressed his disapproval for costly cutting-edge medical technologies and has said prevention services such as 'annual physicals, screening tests, and other measures' are 'over-demanded.' One of the things we did in the health care legislation was provide a lot of different incentives for preventive care, for screening, to try to help people avoid illnesses on the theory that it would be a lot cheaper if we didn\u2019t do a lot of treatment that was unnecessary. If you could identify in advance that an individual had a need for some treatment, maybe you could catch the disease, say, the cancer, early and not have the expensive treatment, the end-of-life kind of care that is frequently very expensive.\"\n\nKyl's new use of the royal \"we\" didn't quite mesh with his vocal opposition to the bill. In a health care debate last year -- that ended up a minor hit on YouTube -- Kyl argued against mandating blanket coverages.\n\n\"I don't need maternity care, and so requiring that to be in my insurance policy is something that I don't need and will make the policy more expensive,\" Kyl said.\n\nSo were Kyl's recent comments from the Senate floor an endorsement of the health care bill's preventive care provisions, and was he now taking credit for it?\n\n\"Sen. Kyl did not, in fact, 'take credit for' anything in his remark,\" said Andrew Wilder, a spokesman for Kyl. \"'We' was a factual reference to Congress, and did not contain a partisan context, as some now assert presumably for political reasons.\"\n\nStill, Democrats note that Kyl's tone appears to have changed, saying \"we\" instead of the more typical reference to the bill as \"the Democrat health care bill.\"\n\n\"The way he's talking about it, he's talking about it like it's a good thing,\" said Brian Cook, press secretary for Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., chair of the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee.\n\nWhether that amounts to taking credit for the idea is getting into a bit of semantics. Certainly Republicans -- and Kyl in particular -- have forcefully opposed the health care bill, and repeatedly spoken of it in terms that liken it to a disaster. And so we can understand Democrats' frustration when a strong opponent of the bill cites a provision of of the bill that \"we did\" -- especially in light of his earlier comments against requiring insurers to carry preventive services -- like maternity care -- that not everyone would use. But we think it's a bit of a stretch to suggest that Kyl was \"taking credit\" for that provision.\n\nThe \"taking credit\" moniker better fits the comments regarding Boehner.\n\nIn an April 30, 2010, interview with Boehner on National Public Radio, a reporter said, \"As you know, Democrats are already pointing to things that are already changing in America because of this (health care) bill. They will point to the fact that college seniors who would have been kicked off their parents' insurance when they graduated will get to stay on. Insurance companies are now saying they are going to end the practice of rescissions, or at least modify it...\"\n\nBoehner interjected, \"Both of those ideas, by the way, came from Republicans and are part of the comments and ideas that we ought to have in the law.\"\n\nMichael Steel, a spokesman for Boehner, noted that both provisions -- abolishing rescissions and encouraging extended coverage of young adults on their parents\u2019 insurance through age 25 -- were included in the Republican alternative health care plan proposed by Boehner last November.\n\nBut the ideas were in the Democrats' health plan long before that. And if they were Republican ideas, asked Cook, the Democratic spokesman for the Ways and Means committee, then why was it never a part of the Republicans' legislative agenda when they held the majority?\n\n\nWe weren't able to pinpoint who originated the ideas, but we can say these were two ideas with rare bipartisan support -- as they were both in the Democratic and Republican health care proposals. It's certainly true that Republicans aggressively fought the health care bill, and are now aggressively seeking to overturn it. But it is misleading to suggest Republicans tried to derail the health care bill based on these two provisions.\n\nSo are Wasserman Schultz and DeLauro correct that Republicans are now \"taking credit\" for provisions of the health care bill \"that they had tried to derail\"?\n\nIn the case of Kyl comments, we think it's a stretch to say he took credit for the preventive care provisions in the health care bill. But Boehner did credit Republicans for provisions to abolish rescissions and allow young adults to continue being covered by their parents\u2019 plans until age 26. Yet those specific provisions were not the target of the GOP opposition, which focused on larger issues of cost and the growth of government"}
{"label": "false", "claim": "Mike Pence Says Donald Trump \"hasn\u2019t broken his promise\" to release his tax returns.", "evidence": "Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns became a fiery point of contention between vice presidential nominees Tim Kaine and Mike Pence in their first and only debate.\n\"Donald Trump started this campaign in 2014, and he said, \u2018If I run for president, I will absolutely release my taxes,\u2019 \" Kaine charged. \"He's broken his first \u2014 \"\n\"And he will,\" Pence interjected.\n\"He's broken his first promise,\" Kaine insisted.\n\"He hasn't broken his promise,\" Pence said. \"Look, Donald Trump has filed over 100 pages of financial disclosure, which is what the law requires. The American people can review that. And he's going -- senator, he's going to release his tax returns when the audit is over.\"\n\"Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit,\" Kaine countered accurately, before the moderator directed the discussion to Social Security.\nKaine was referencing a 2014 interview Trump did with Irish TV. While he didn't use those exact words, Kaine's quote is largely accurate. That was before Trump was actually running for president.\u00a0\nBut Trump has said he would release his tax returns multiple times since annoucning his candidacy as well.\u00a0\n\"Will you release any of your tax returns for the public to scrutinize?\" NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd asked Trump in January 2016.\n\"Well, we're working on that now. I have very big returns, as you know, and I have everything all approved and very beautiful and we'll be working that over in the next period of time, Chuck. Absolutely,\" Trump replied.\nA few weeks later, Trump told the Today Show\u00a0in February 2016 that\u00a0he\u2019ll release his tax returns \"probably over the next few months.\"\nSince those comments, Trump has repeated the promise but with conditions. Recently, he\u2019s said he would release them once Clinton releases all of her emails. And as Pence mentioned, Trump has said repeatedly he has yet to do so because an ongoing IRS audit.

{"label": "false", "claim": "Bill Haslam \"Personal income is growing faster in Tennessee on average than any other state in the country.\"", "evidence": "In a speech to the Carter County Republican Party\u2019s \"Reagan Day\" gathering, Gov. Bill Haslam hailed the accomplishments of himself and Republicans controlling the state legislature in leading Tennessee to better times.\n\nAfter repeating some oft-heard declarations about cutting the state budget and \"aggressive\" pursuit of new jobs by creating a business-friendly environment, he added a new claim to exemplify the results of Republican leadership.\n\n\"In Tennessee \u2013 personal income is growing faster in Tennessee on average than any other state in the country,\" the governor said as he concluded his remarks.\n\nWe hadn\u2019t heard that and decided to check the veracity. And because the claim was made as he touted his accomplishments, we'll also factor in the extent to which the growth in income was created by the official or their policies.\n\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), an arm of the U.S. Department of Commerce, released its latest report on personal income growth on March 28, providing a 50-state list based on 2011 figures.\n\nHere is the first paragraph of the BEA\u2019s news release:\n\n\"State personal income rose an average 5.1 percent in 2011 after rising 3.7 percent in 2010, according to estimates released today by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. State personal income growth ranged from 3.4 percent in Maine to 8.1 percent in North Dakota. Inflation, as measured by the national price index for personal consumption expenditures, increased to 2.5 percent in 2011 from 1.8 percent in 2010.\"\n\nNorth Dakota, then, not Tennessee, is deemed No. 1 in the nation.\n\nThe tables accompanying the release show Tennessee\u2019s per capita growth in personal income for 2011 was 5.4 percent, increasing from $34,921 to $36,533. That was the 16th highest percentage increase in the nation, which is pretty good, but some distance from the top.\n\nDavid Smith, spokesman for the governor, said the BEA report was, indeed, the source of his information and noted that there were media reports stating that Tennessee had the highest percentage increase in the Southeast and that the rate \"was one of the best in the nation.\"\n\nHe and Alexia Poe, communications director for the Haslam administration, acknowledged the governor had made a mistake. The comment came at the end of a long day that included events in Nashville and Knoxville before making it to Elizabethton for the evening partisan speech. Poe said Haslam \"perhaps melded two comments together\" \u2013 that Tennessee leads in the Southeast and that is one of the highest averages in the nation.\n\nAs for being tops in the Southeast, a couple of points may be worth noting to put Tennessee\u2019s standing in perspective. One is that Texas is not considered part of the Southeast. And another -- the Southeast ranked lowest in average personal income among the eight regions listed by the BEA. The top region is New England with an average income of $51,074.\n\nThe Southeastern per capita personal income average in 2011 was $37,472 versus the national average of $41,683. And Tennessee\u2019s average income, even after the growth in 2011, is still below the Southeastern average.\n\nIn rating states for average personal income, not growth, Tennessee last year was No. 36 in the nation, up one notch from 37th in 2010.\n\nAs for credit for the income growth? When we evaluated Haslam\u2019s claim about job growth, we determined it was a stretch to say a governor in his first year in office had much real impact on improved economic numbers, based in part on the evaluation of economists.\n\nMalcolm Getz, a Vanderbilt University economics professor, said it\u2019s also a little premature of Haslam to start claiming or otherwise implying credit for income growth. \"Governor Haslam's programs are unlikely to have had any significant effect in 2011,\" he said. \"For the most part, the effect of policy shifts accumulate over several years. The main forces that drive economic growth are out of the control of governors.\"\n\nOne huge \"force\" is the national economy, and Tennessee\u2019s 5.4 percent growth was just above the national average. So even if this involved a governor who had been in office for several years, it\u2019s clear that Tennessee benefitted from national patterns not directly related to specific state policy.\n\nOur ruling\n\nEven if it was a mistake made at the conclusion of a long day, Haslam told an audience that personal income was growing faster in Tennessee than in any other state -- something that we see on video and that was then reported by a newspaper. In fact, 15 states showed better per capita income growth than Tennessee did, and the state only outpaced the national average by 0.3 percent.\n\nHe also, in our determination, is trying to take premature credit for income growth that for the most part occurred before any of his policies had been put into place"}

Since his new book Immigration Wars was released this week, Bush has been accused of changing position.\n\n\"@JebBush a flip-flop-flip on immigration? Wow. I fashioned you more of a baseball player than a gymnast. My bad. #notsurprisedatall,\" Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz quipped in a tweet on March 5, 2013.\n\nBush, 60, has enjoyed distinction as an elder statesman in the Republican party since leaving elected office in 2007. But with the release of his book, Bush has indicated he\u2019s considering a future presidential run (\"I\u2019m not saying yes, I\u2019m just not saying no,\" he told MSNBC).\n\nWe found that Bush, now a definite maybe for 2016, has indeed said conflicting things over time about eventual citizenship for illegal immigrants.\n\n \u2018Start deporting people\u2019\n\nBush, a Texas native who calls Florida his adopted home state, plunged into politics in 1994 with a run to unseat Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles.\n\nBack then, there was virtually no talk of turning millions of illegal immigrants in the U.S. into citizens. When asked what to do with them, Bush had one word: deportation.\n\nIn an interview with the Miami Herald, he was asked, \"There are something like 4 million illegals in the United States . . . . What would you do with the ones that are here?\"\n\n\"Start deporting people,\" he answered. \"We have an asylum process . . . . It shouldn't take five years. We need to reform our system. ... I don't blame them for wanting to come to our country, but I don't believe it's necessarily our responsibility to allow them to come in.\"\n\nBut he also made it clear he was not in favor of closing the border. \"I believe in open, legal immigration,\" Bush said.\n\nHe lost that election, but stormed back four years later and won the governor\u2019s race.\n\nBy 2006, Bush was well-established as Florida\u2019s chief executive, and he wasn\u2019t afraid to criticize members of his own party. His views, it seems, had evolved beyond \"start deporting people.\"\n\nIn an email exchange with the Los Angeles Times that year, Bush weighed in with support for proposed federal immigration reform legislation, calling it \"just plain wrong\" to charge illegal immigrants with a felony and opposed \"penalizing the children of illegal immigrants\" by denying them U.S. citizenship.\n\nHe endorsed the idea of a broad guest-worker program, but the Los Angeles Times noted then that he \"offered no specificity on how to treat current immigrants and whether they should be granted a path to citizenship.\"\n\nIn 2009, Bush co-chaired a bipartisan task force for the Council on Foreign Relations, which studied immigration challenges and came up with a set of proposals. In an interview about the group\u2019s recommendations, Bush said that if reform doesn\u2019t happen, \"we ignore an issue that needs to be solved, which is what do we do with people who are here permanently, who have made contributions, who if given a path to citizenship would do what's right and take the necessary steps to achieve legalized status and citizenship.\"\n\nHowever, in a separate op-ed about the task force recommendations, Bush simply said reform should include \"a fair and orderly way to allow many of those currently living here illegally to earn the right to remain legally.\"\n\n2012: Bush stakes his position\n\nLast year, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney declared that he would pursue an immigration policy so austere that illegal immigrants would self-deport -- a position later faulted for Republicans\u2019 poor showing among Hispanic voters.\n\nBush, meanwhile, continued his call for more welcoming rhetoric and a \"broader approach\" to legislation that dealt with issues beyond border security and cracking down on illegal migration. In an interview last summer with Charlie Rose, he made a clear declaration that he favored citizenship.\n\n\"You have to deal with this issue. You can\u2019t ignore it. And so, either a path to citizenship, which I would support and that does put me probably out of the mainstream of most conservatives; Or a path to legalization, a path to residency of some kind,\" he said.\n\nFast forward past the election. It\u2019s now 2013, and Republicans are smarting from their losses and pledging to remake their platform into one that appeals more to Hispanics and other minorities. A bipartisan group of Senators is working on reform legislation that includes citizenship.\n\nBut Bush\u2019s book, which reportedly went to the printer in late 2012, split the concepts of citizenship and legal residency. And in print, Bush opposed citizenship and instead proposed \"a path to permanent legal resident status.\"\n\n\"Permanent residency in this context, however, should not lead to citizenship. It is absolutely vital to the integrity of our immigration system that actions have consequences \u2014 in this case, that those who violated the laws can remain but cannot obtain the cherished fruits of citizenship. ... A grant of citizenship is an undeserving reward for conduct that we cannot afford to encourage.\"\n\nIllegal immigrants, he and co-author Clint Bolick wrote, could return to their homeland and apply for citizenship through regular channels.\n\nAfter immediately catching heat over the book -- and how it conflicts with his past position -- Bush began softening up.\n\n\"We wrote this book last year, not this year, and we proposed a path to legalization, so anybody that had come illegally would have immediately a path to legalization,\" Bush said on MSNBC.\n\nHe added: \"If you can craft that in law, where you can have a path to citizenship where there isn\u2019t an incentive for people to come illegally, I\u2019m for it. I don\u2019t have a problem with that.\"\n\nHe told CNN: \"I have supported both \u2014 both a path to legalization or a path to citizenship \u2014 with the underlying principle being that there should be no incentive for people to come illegally at the expense of coming legally.\"\n\nJaryn Emhof, Bush\u2019s communications director, told PolitiFact in an email, \"The book outlines a proposal by which immigrants -- whether they are coming to work temporarily, to go to school, to live and work as permanent residents or seeking citizenship -- can do so through an immigration process that would be much more open than before. So, it is talking about future immigrants, not those currently here illegally.\"\n\nWe think it\u2019s clear, however, that the book\u2019s passages about legal status vs. citizenship very clearly refer to those already here.\n\nOur ruling\n\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz -- admittedly a bit player in this story but for her tweet -- said Bush has made a \"flip-flop-flip\" on immigration.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick chronology:\n\n\u2022 Early in his political life, Bush expressed a hard-line, deportation-driven opinion and made no mention of granting citizenship or legal status to illegal immigrants.\n\n\u2022 Sometime between 2009 and 2012, he \"flipped\" to being in favor of a path to citizenship. He supported federal legislation in 2007 that allowed children of illegal immigrants to become citizens, and wrote frequently that Republicans should adopt a more welcoming approach. In June 2012, he clearly articulated support for a pathway to citizenship.\n\n\u2022 His \"flop\" came this month with the release of his book, in which he explicitly opposed citizenship, calling it an \"undeserving reward\" for people who came here illegally.\n\n\u2022 That was followed by a quick \"flip\" back to support of either citizenship or permanent legal status in the heat of television interviews.\n\nOver the years Bush has said he favored citizenship or legal residency, demonstrating openness to proposals that could be considered within a wider reform effort. So at times he has embraced both, or either one.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt, though, that the Jeb Bush in the book had a different opinion from the Jeb Bush on the book tour"}

Florida Blue anticipated an increase because some other insurers, such as UnitedHealthCare and Aetna, exited the marketplace where consumers can shop for policies.\n\"The number fluctuates throughout the year, but historically the enrollment numbers actually increase within the few months following the open enrollment close date, so that number will probably rise slightly over the next couple of months,\" Kluding said.\nFlorida Blue sells plans in all Florida counties and is the largest insurer participating in the federal marketplace in Florida.\nWith all insurers combined, about 1.7 million Floridians enrolled through the federal health care law for 2017. So Florida Blue is the largest insurer on the marketplace.\nSebelius and Geraghty both attended an annual health care conference at the University of Miami on March 3. At the conference, Kluding said, Geraghty told Sebelius \"that the company is now serving approximately 1 million individual members, and that Florida Blue has operated this ACA business profitably.\"\n\n"}

Michael W. Chippendale rose on the House floor earlier this month to steer his colleagues away from a bill mandating more studies before any future road projects are completed.\n\nThe bill (H7352) required the state Department of Transportation -- whether it was constructing a new highway or putting in a crosswalk -- \u00a0to use \"complete street design principles\" that considered the \"mobility needs of all users.\" The department would then have to issue a report showing it had considered, for example, the needs of bicyclists and pedestrians \"of all ages.\"\n\nChippendale, a Republican from Foster, called the bill arduous and costly. He said he\u2019d rather see the money that would go toward design studies used to improve the state\u2019s roads, because, he said, the state has the \"worst-maintained bridges in the United States of America . . . and we have the second-worst maintained roads only to Alaska.\"\n\nThe poor condition of the state\u2019s bridges and roads has been a focus of attention for years. Rhode Island, like many other states, just doesn\u2019t have enough money to repair and rebuild all those needing attention. But we wondered whether we really have among the worst roads and bridges in the nation.\n\nOn the House floor, Chippendale attributed his information to the National Highway Safety Association, a transportation entity we searched in vain to find. But Chippendale might be forgiven for mixing up the name, considering the multitude of groups that have weighed in on state road conditions.\n\nAmong them: The Governors Highway Safety Association; the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials; the Surface Transportation Policy Project; TRIP, a private transportation research nonprofit; U.S. PIRG, the federation of state public interest research groups; the Reason Foundation -- the list goes on.\n\nAll the groups use the same basic data that state highway agencies submit each year to the Federal Highway Administration on road and bridge deterioration and spending. Researchers for the groups then choose their own various criteria from the data to study and compare, to suit their objectives.\n\nWhen we contacted Chippendale, he acknowledged that he attributed his statement incorrectly on the House floor. He said the basis of his claim came from a report he had filed away with information from his 2010 campaign. He then e-mailed us a copy of the 19th Annual Report on the Performance of State Highway Systems, issued in September 2010 by the Reason Foundation, a \u00a0Libertarian research group that monitors government spending and efficiency.\n\nChippendale said he had also seen other reports, as well as newspaper stories that supported his statement.\n\nThe Reason Foundation report \u00a0is based on 2008 data compiled by the Federal Highway Administration. It indeed rated Rhode Island\u2019s bridges and roads the worst overall in the country. (The state Department of Transportation doesn\u2019t dispute the findings. It says the problem is an issue of money.) Alaska came in right behind us at 49th.\n\n(By \u00a0the way, Massachusetts was ranked 44th and Connecticut, 41st. New Hampshire was the best ranked New England state, at 27.)\n\nThe states that ranked best -- North Dakota and Montana, for example -- had roads that were in good condition and had small transportation budgets. The foundation reported that \"Rhode Island is spending about two to three times the national average, per mile, on its state road system . . .\"\n\nOther recent reports have offered similar findings about the Ocean State\u2019s roads and bridges.\n\nIn 2009, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that sets standards for road design and construction, ranked Rhode Island the third worst state in the country for \"poor\" roads, with only New Jersey and California having worse roads.\n\nIn 2010, the consumer group U.S. PIRG, a federation of consumer activist groups from around the country, issued a report that said Rhode Island had the highest percentage of \"structurally deficient\" bridges (27 percent) in the country. The group, using Federal Highway Administration data, defined structurally deficient as meaning \"a bridge has a major defect in its support structure or its deck is cracking and deteriorating.\"\n\nThat percentage has since dropped to around 22 percent -- the fourth worst in the country -- because the Route 195 relocation project eliminated about a dozen of those bad bridges, a state DOT spokesman says. The findings are also in a report from Transportation For America, another coalition of road budget watchdogs.\n\nOur ruling\n\nState Rep.

{"label": "false", "claim": "Michael Riley The Congressional Budget Office \"has already doubled its estimate for the cost (of Obamacare) so far from roughly $800 billion to $1.7 trillion.\"", "evidence": "Cost is one of the key objections critics raise when the topic is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nThe issue came up July 26 during a debate on the public access program State of the State among Republican candidates for Rhode Island\u2019s 2nd Congressional District seat. (It will begin airing Aug. 4.)\n\n\"I have a problem with almost every aspect of (Obamacare),\" said one of the candidates, Michael Riley. He said it would create too many new agencies and \"we also have skyrocketing health-care costs, even in the first two years of implementation. The CBO has already doubled its estimate for the cost (of Obamacare) so far, from roughly $800 billion to $1.7 trillion.\"\n\nThe CBO is the Congressional Budget Office, the widely respected nonpartisan agency that generates estimates and reports about the effect that proposed laws will likely have on the federal budget.\n\nWe asked Riley\u2019s campaign for his backup and, while we waited for their response, began our own research.\n\nPolitiFact has checked similar claims and found them, to be kind, less than factual.\n\nThe CBO's initial estimate on March 2010 was that the gross cost from 2012 to 2019 would be $931 billion.\n\nIts newer estimate from March 2012 put the gross cost at $1,762 billion, which is where the complaints about doubling originated. But that was for a different time frame -- from 2012 to 2022.\n\nPolitiFact National found that if you compare the CBO figures for 2012-2019, a period covered by both reports, the estimate of the gross cost hadn't doubled, as Riley claimed. It had risen 8.6 percent, from $931 billion to $1.01 trillion.\n\nThe $1.7 trillion figure was so widely misused, the CBO issued a statement saying that its estimates had not shifted significantly. \"The projections for each given year have changed little, on net, since March 2010,\" the statement said.\n\nBut wait, as they say in the commercials, there's more.\n\nThe $1.7 trillion estimate doesn't include money saved from spending cuts, revenue from new taxes on the wealthy, penalties paid by individuals and workers who decide not to buy insurance, and other cost-saving measures included in the law.\n\nWhen the CBO took all of that into account, which it did in a 2010 report, it concluded that the health-care law would actually save money, lowering the deficit by about $132 billion between 2012-2019.\n\nIn a 2011 update, it found that the projected deficit reduction had slipped to $119 billion, but it was still a net savings.\n\nIn July, before Riley made his statement, the CBO updated some of its estimates in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to uphold most of the 2010 law. The CBO said the cost would be lower still, although the new projected savings would come from the fact that several states have vowed not to expand the eligibility requirements for Medicaid to help more uninsured people, invoking an exemption opened up by the Supreme Court ruling.\n\nAt the same time, the CBO estimated that if the Affordable Care Act were to be repealed, that would add $109 billion to federal budget deficits from 2013 to 2022.\n\nRiley responded to our question by sending us a handful of links, most of them editorials from the conservative Washington Examiner that compared estimates from different time frames or disputed Obamacare supporters who say the cost estimates haven\u2019t doubled.

Here's why: Since 1976, the federal government has been guided by the Hyde Amendment, a law that prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is in peril. Due to that amendment -- which must be renewed every year -- abortion services are not provided in health care plans offered to federal employees and for active and retired military.\nBut the health care reform bill proposes a health care exchange in which private insurance companies could compete for the business of people who do not get their insurance through an employer. The question then: Should private companies be allowed to offer abortion coverage (as most already do)? And what if the people buying policies are getting government subsidies to buy insurance?\nIn the House, Stupak helped add an amendment that bars anyone who accepts federal subsidies for health coverage from buying a plan with abortion coverage on the exchange. The amendment does let them choose a plan with abortion coverage if they pay for it without using federal subsidies. And those who accept subsidies can still buy an abortion \"rider\" -- that is, a separate policy covering abortion -- as long as they pay for it entirely with their own money.\nThe Senate took a different tack. The Senate language on abortion, written by an abortion opponent, Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., would allow companies in the exchange to offer abortion services, even to people who get federal subsidies. But Nelson inserted measures to ensure abortion services would be paid through patient premiums, not federal subsidies. In order to accomplish that, the Senate bill requires that anyone who selects a plan that covers abortion must pay $1 a month toward a segregated fund that would pay for abortion services. One plan in every state exchange must offer coverage that does not include abortions, so there would be an option for those who morally object to $1 of their premiums going toward abortion services. Legislators supporting the bill -- along with President Obama -- insist that segregation of funds stays true to the Hyde Amendment restriction on federal funds for abortions.\n\n"}

Experts and human rights advocates we spoke with say that improving economic conditions have indeed produced better living conditions for many Chinese citizens.\nAs it is, when Chinese leaders claim progress in human rights, they are mostly referring to \"human welfare,\" said Patrick Keenan, an expert in human rights and international law at the University of Illinois.\n\"They're thinking about China's incredible economic growth and the ways that that economic growth has improved the lives of poor people in China,\" Keenan said. \"China's growth hasn't helped everyone, of course, but it is true that poor people, on average, are better off than they were a generation ago.\"\nThe reform era of the 1970s that opened China\u2019s doors to a degree to the rest of the world resulted in a vast economic expansion, especially in the urban centers. Some social freedoms followed, such as the ability to move or take different jobs.\nHowever, such gains only accrued to certain sectors of the population. For example, according to Human Rights Watch, millions of farmers and herders who are Tibetan \u2014 an ethnic minority in China \u2014 have been subjected to a mass rehousing-and-relocation policy that forced them into socialist villages. And more generally, outside China\u2019s rapidly growing cities, the economic gains have been less significant.\nThere are two other notable areas of progress, each with limits.\nFirst, China has signed several international conventions and treaties pertaining to human rights. While there are clear examples of these agreements being ignored, the simple fact that China has agreed to them \"is important because it creates an opportunity to make claims against the state,\" said Richardson of Human Rights Watch. All told, China has signed 10 of the 16 United Nations agreements pertaining to human rights.\nHowever, in most cases, China has attached a stated \"reservation\" that says they won\u2019t abide by parts of the agreement that interfere with state laws.

Because hospitals by law cannot refuse emergency care, uninsured patients may be left with no option beyond the E.R. even to treat minor health issues. Yet this is an expensive solution for the health care system, since E.R. care costs much more than routine medical care dispensed by general practitioners. By increasing insurance coverage, the thinking went, patients would be steered toward providers who charge less than emergency rooms, saving money for insurers and, ultimately, for patients and taxpayers.\nSo has it worked?\nThe official statistics on emergency-room visits are published on an annual basis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, the most recent report -- released in 2014 -- covers 2011, which was well before most elements of the health care law kicked in.

As it turns out, the vast majority of the 300,000 found coverage -- with Florida Blue.\n\"More than 80 percent of the approximately 300,000 members remained with Florida Blue,\" company spokesman Paul C. Kluding told PolitiFact.\nThat would leave at most 60,000 people -- not 300,000 -- who lost their health insurance as a result of that provision of the law. But even that number is probably high.\n\n"}
{"label": "false", "claim": "Donald Trump \"Libya supplies the oil for China. We get no oil from Libya.\"", "evidence": "Donald Trump has said he\u2019s thinking about running for president, and while he\u2019s gotten a lot of attention for questioning President Barack Obama\u2019s birth certificate, he\u2019s also made several provocative statements about foreign policy.\n\nIn an interview on Fox News, Trump discussed the Middle East, starting out with the war in Iraq, then moving on to U.S. air strikes in Libya.\n\n\"You know in the old days, when you won a war, to the victor belongs the spoils. You kept it,\" Trump said. \"We win a war, and we hand it over to some people we don't know and we leave.\"\n\n\"And we lose the contracts to China,\" interjected one of the Fox anchors.\n\n\"Yes, China will be another one,\" Trump agreed. \"By the way, Libya supplies the oil for China. We get no oil from Libya. What are we doing?\"\n\nWe thought Trump\u2019s statement about Libya and China was interesting, so we decided to look into it. We asked a Trump spokesman for comment, but we didn't hear back.\n\nSo we turned to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), a federal agency that collects data on energy. We\u2019ll take Trump\u2019s statement in two parts.\n\n\u00a0\u2022 Libya supplies the oil for China. Libya does supply some oil to China, but it\u2019s not as large as Trump\u2019s statement implies.\n\nThe EIA showed that Libya\u2019s No. 1 customer is Italy, which bought 28 percent of Libya\u2019s exports in 2010. Italy was followed by France, at 15 percent, then China, at 11 percent. After that, Libya sold to Germany, 10 percent; Spain, 10 percent; Greece, 5 percent; the United Kingdom, 4 percent, and United States, 3 percent. (More on that 3 percent in a bit.) Other countries combined to buy 14 percent of Libya\u2019s exports.\n\nWe also wanted to know what share of China's imported oil comes from Libya. We found that in 2009, China bought most of its imported oil from Saudi Arabia, which supplied 21 percent. That was followed by Angola, 16 percent; Iran, 11 percent; Russia, 8 percent; Sudan, 6 percent; Oman, 6 percent; Iraq, 3.5 percent; Kuwait, 3.5 percent and then Libya at 3.1 percent. Libya is followed by Kazakhstan at 2.9 percent and Venezuela at 2.6 percent. Other countries combined supplied 17.4 percent of China\u2019s imports.\n\nSo China is a big customer of Libyan oil, but not the biggest, and there are many other customers. And Libya is far from being China\u2019s chief supplier. It ranks ninth.\n\n\u00a0\u2022 We get no oil from Libya. The United States doesn\u2019t get much oil from Libya.\n\nIn 2010, the U.S. imported 25.7 million barrels of oil from Libya, down from a recent high of 42.8 million barrels in 2007. The U.S. didn\u2019t import any oil from Libya between 1982 and 2004, due to an oil embargo first imposed by President Ronald Reagan.\n\nLibya is such a small source that it doesn\u2019t make it into the list of the top 15 countries from which the United States imports oil.\n\nU.S companies are working to develop Libya\u2019s oil sector, however. In 2009, a deputy assistant secretary of state told Congress that U.S. companies are \"probably the most active and the most successful\" in helping Libya revitalize its oil sector.\n\n\"They're seeking our technology because it's the best in the world and we're doing quite well,\" said the U.S. State Department\u2019s William Hudson. \"The Chinese are also active, but our companies have really taken the lion's share so far of bidding on plots for oil production.\"\n\nTrump said, \"Libya supplies the oil for China. We get no oil from Libya.\" His point in the first sentence was clearly that Libya was a major supplier of oil for China. But the data do not support his claim. Libya is far from being China\u2019s chief supplier. It ranks ninth.\n\n"}

Sounds like those young whippersnappers aren\u2019t spending much time behind the wheel of Daddy\u2019s T-Bird.\n\nThe referendum is up for a vote July 31 and would raise $7.2 billion over 10 years to upgrade roads and transit across the region.\n\nWe called up Dickerson and took a closer look at the data, which comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n\nThe National Household Travel Survey tracks how and why people travel. It takes place sporadically. The most recent ones were conducted in 2001 and 2009.\n\nIn April of this year, the consumer group U.S. PIRG, a federation of state public interest research groups, and Frontier Group, an environmental think tank, issued \"Transportation and the New Generation,\" a report that analyzed data from this and other surveys. \u00a0\n\nWe found Dickerson used the correct percentage.\n\nThe report found that the average number of miles traveled on transit by a person in this age group increased by 40 percent between 2001 and 2009. Our own analysis of NHTS data and the report\u2019s calculation confirms this. \u00a0\n\nIn fact, the survey\u2019s other findings indicate these bright young things are relying on ways to travel that don\u2019t involve a car. \u00a0\n\nThe number of bike trips per person in Generation Y is up about 27 percent, NHTS data said. Walking increased about 16 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, the average number of trips these youngsters take in personal vehicles declined about 18 percent, according to the survey. The miles they travel is down 23 percent. \u00a0\n\nBackers of public transit list a host of reasons why.\n\nThe report says higher gas prices have pushed younger people to try other means of transportation, as have more stringent state age requirements for driver\u2019s licenses.\n\nDarnell Grisby, director of policy development and research with the American Public Transportation Association, a transit industry group, mentioned findings by a real estate market research company that show that members of Generation Y overwhelmingly prefer walkable communities, whether in the suburbs or city. \u00a0\n\nAlso, the share of teenagers with driver\u2019s licenses has dropped in recent decades.\n\nIn 1983, about 87 percent of 19-year-olds had their licenses, according to a University of Michigan study. By 2008, 75 percent did.\n\nBut one NHTS finding about transit use made us wonder whether the dramatic statistic Dickerson used during the debate told the whole story. \u00a0\n\nWhile the average number of person miles that younger people travel on transit skyrocketed, the number of trips they took on transit did not. These increased by only about 4 percent\n\nIt appears that 16- to 34-year-olds are hopping on public trains and buses slightly more often but are taking much longer trips.\n\nWhy might this be? Baruch Feigenbaum is a transportation policy analyst for the Reason Foundation, a think tank that favors free-market solutions to policy issues.\n\nSince such a small percentage of Americans use transit on their daily commutes, a small jump in the number of people who ride buses and trains might translate into a big percentage increase.\n\n\"While transit usage has increased, the gains may not be as impressive as they appear,\" \u00a0Feigenbaum said.\n\nHow do we rule?\n\nWe found that the number of per capita passenger miles traveled did increase by 40 percent, the number Dickerson used.\n\nBut Dickerson\u2019s use of the word \"ridership\" might have led viewers to think that younger people are taking 40 percent more trips on transit. This number ticked up by only about 4 percent.\n\nBy either NHTS measure, it\u2019s fair to say that younger people are leaving Daddy\u2019s T-Bird in the driveway and relying more heavily on transit.\n\nBut Dickerson could have been much more precise"}

But virality and retweets don\u2019t make a claim accurate, and this meme distorts the facts.\nEach claim is either misleading or outrageously wrong. We'll explain why.\u00a0\n\u2018$6 billion lost at the State Department\u2019\nThis echoes reports from many conservative pundits and outlets (and some nonpartisan news sites) about a State Department Inspector General alert in March 2014.\nThe alert warned that files for over $6 billion worth of contracts from 2008 to 2014 \u2014 spanning the entirety of Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 \u2014 \u00a0\"were incomplete or could not be located at all.\"\nA spokesman for the Office of the Inspector General told PolitiFact the alert speaks for itself, but many seemed to misinterpret what it actually said. The confusion prompted Inspector General Steve Linick to pen a clarification in the Washington Post.\n\"Some have concluded based on this that $6 billion is missing. The alert, however, did not draw that conclusion,\" he wrote. \"Instead, it found that the failure to adequately maintain contract files \u2014 documents necessary to ensure the full accounting of U.S. tax dollars \u2014 \u2018creates significant financial risk and demonstrates a lack of internal control over the Department\u2019s contract actions.\u2019 \"\nIn other words, the State Department was terrible at paperwork. The $6 billion figure refers to the total amount affected by file mismanagement. It\u2019s akin to spending $20 on lunch and losing or not asking for a receipt. Documentation over where that $20 went was lost, but not the $20 itself.\nSo the State Department under Clinton, who wasn\u2019t mentioned in the alert, may have been financially disorganized, but it didn\u2019t \"lose\" $6 billion.\n\u2018Sold uranium to the Russia through my faux charity\u2019\nTrump offered\u00a0a more nuanced (but still Mostly False) version of this claim: \"Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department approved the transfer of 20 percent of America\u2019s uranium holdings to Russia, while nine investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.\"\nThe State Department didn\u2019t unilaterally greenlight Russia\u2019s purchase of a company with U.S. uranium assets. It was one of nine government agencies, along with federal and state nuclear regulators, that approved the deal. Moreover, there is no evidence that Clinton personally advocated for approval.\nNine people related to the company did give to the Clinton Foundation at some point in time, but most of their donations occurred before the Russian deal.\nCohen\u2019s meme is a more outlandish. Given the available evidence, the most that can be said is the State Department had a hand in the approval process, and Clinton Foundation donors were linked to the company Russia purchased. That may look fishy, but there\u2019s no proof of quid pro quo.\n\u2018Illegally deleted public records\u2019\nThis part of the meme refers to Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server. While Clinton\u2019s actions in deleting some 31,000 emails certainly broached the rules of record keeping, the meme\u2019s use of the word \"illegally\" is premature.\nBefore she turned over the server to the State Department, she and her staff deleted half of all the emails without government review, saying they were personal correspondence. Her decision is the subject of FBI scrutiny.\nBut was this illegal? It depends, according to Douglas Cox, a law professor at City University of New York who studies records preservation.\n\"If Clinton destroyed work emails knowing they should have been kept and was intentionally trying to remove them from the public record, then yes, that is illegal and it is a crime,\" he said. \"In the end, I think there is not enough public information available to know whether Clinton did \u2018illegally\u2019 destroy public records.\"\n\n"}

The topic: the deaths of four Americans in a 2012 attack on a U.S. complex in Benghazi, Libya.\n\"Here's an interesting one: Sidney Blumenthal,\" Trump said to boos, referring to a longtime confidant of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Trump, speaking in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., on Oct. 10, continued (at about the 44-minute\u00a0mark.):\n\"Do you remember when Ambassador (Chris) Stevens in Benghazi was calling, and writing -- they were desperate for help. They say like 600 times, right? The only one she was speaking to is Sidney Blumenthal,\u00a0who's a sleaze. He's a sleaze. In fact, Obama wanted her restricted (so) that she couldn't speak (to him).

{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Marcia Fudge \"More than a quarter of mortgage borrowers are underwater, and 11 percent of all homes are vacant.\"", "evidence": "Mortgage foreclosure problems have been a top concern the past several years for many politicians including, Democratic Rep. Marcia Fudge.\n\nFudge, of Warrensville Heights in suburban Cleveland, took to the House of Representatives floor on Dec. 15 \u00a0to call for legislation to revitalize neighborhoods plagued by vacant and abandoned homes.\n\n\"Remnants of the foreclosure crisis linger everywhere,\" said Fudge, citing home values pummeled by the plague of blighted and abandoned houses. \"More than a quarter of mortgage borrowers are underwater and 11 percent of all homes are vacant.\"\n\nFudge\u2019s statistics on underwater mortgages and home vacancies certainly sounded alarming so we asked Fudge\u2019s office where she got them.\n\nAccording to spokeswoman Laura Allen, Fudge got her data on underwater mortgages from the Zillow real estate information and sales service. The group\u2019s number crunchers found that in the third quarter of 2011, 28.6 of the nation\u2019s mortgage borrowers owed more money on their houses than their property was worth.\n\nBorrowers can end up underwater on their mortgages if their homes decline in value or if their mortgage debt increases. Sometimes the two factors combine. Negative equity makes borrowers more vulnerable to foreclosure because it makes it harder to sell or refinance their houses if they can\u2019t keep current on their mortgage payments.\n\nUnderwater borrowers who can still afford their mortgage payments sometimes walk away from the loss and allow their homes to enter foreclosure. Such \"strategic defaults\" add to the glut of vacancies and further drag down home prices.\n\nStatistics that Zillow provided to Fudge\u2019s office indicated 41.5 percent of single-family homes with mortgages in the Cleveland metropolitan area were underwater during the third quarter of 2011. To compute its statistics, Zillow looks at the total amount of loans taken out by a homeowner at the time of purchase and compares it to the current value of the home. It obtains its raw data from county recorders\u2019 offices around the nation.\n\nBut those statistics only look at the borrowed amounts and the property valuations. A Zillow spokeswoman acknowledged the statistics don\u2019t reflect equity that a longer-term homeowner could build up over years of making payments.\n\nWe also checked with another organization, CoreLogic, which incorporates the extra home equity accrued by longer-term homeowners into the negative equity statistics it compiles. CoreLogic\u2019s latest study found that 22.1 percent of all mortgaged residential properties were underwater during the last quarter of 2011.\n\nFudge obtained her home vacancy numbers from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nIts data on the nation\u2019s housing showed an 11.4 percent vacancy rate in 2010: 14,988,438 empty residences out of a total of 131,704,730. But further examination of that national data reveals that \u00a031 percent of those empty homes were \"for seasonal, recreational or occasional use,\" 27.6 percent were for vacant rental properties, and 12.7 percent were unoccupied \u00a0homes for sale.\n\nIn hard-hit Cuyahoga County, Fudge\u2019s home county and Ohio\u2019s most populous, 2010 Census figures showed a vacancy rate of 12.3 percent, with 42 percent of those vacancies for rent and 12.6 percent for sale. A mere 3.2 percent of Cuyahoga County\u2019s vacancies consisted of seasonal or recreational property.\n\nSo while the 11 percent figure for vacancies is on point, it appears there are many reasons homes can be unoccupied. So has the foreclosure crises has had a lasting impact? In her floor speech, she mentions it as she discussed \"remnants of the foreclosure crisis.\"\n\nTo examine whether the foreclosure crisis actually boosted the vacancy rate, we looked at national data from the 2000 Census, which was taken long before the foreclosure tsunami hit. It showed a 9 percent vacancy rate that year - or 10,424,540 vacancies out of a total 115,904,641 units.\n\nA comparison of data from the two Censuses shows a the proportions of vacant units for sale and for rent both increased slightly since 2000. Over that 10-year period, the ratio of vacant homes that were for sale rose from 11.6 percent to 12.7 percent. The ratio of rental vacancies rose from 25.1 to 27.6 percent. A higher proportion of the vacant homes in 2000 were categorized as being for \"seasonal, recreational or occasional use\" - 34.3 percent.\n\nU.S. Census Bureau statistician Melisa Kresin said the Census Bureau does not measure foreclosures, and its survey of vacant homes would not accurately measure them. She noted that homes can be vacant for numerous reasons, and that many people continue to occupy their homes while the foreclosure process is underway. She attributed some of the increased vacancies to the rise in multigenerational households.\n\n\"Once a child graduates, there is a greater chance now that it will move in with parents instead of getting an apartment,\" said Kresin. \"There are lots of factors that go into these rates.\"\n\nFudge\u2019s claim is partially accurate. The Zillow number she used for mortgage borrowers who are underwater does exceed 25 percent, although that data doesn\u2019t consider payment history that could affect the results. CoreLogic\u2019s negative equity analysis produced a smaller number by using a different methodology. That number was less than 25 percent, but in the ballpark.\n\nHer statement that 11 percent of the nation\u2019s homes are vacant is technically accurate. But there are many reasons that those homes are unoccupied and a researcher for the source of her figure, the U.S. Census Bureau, cautioned that its survey of vacant homes would not accurately measure foreclosures.\n\nAnd, the fact that 9 percent of homes were unoccupied in the 2000 survey, long before the foreclosure crisis took hold, indicates a large proportion of the vacancies Fudge cites are not foreclosure-related.\n\nThat\u2019s important information that puts her claim into context"}

It's never happened in the history of our nation. But we seem to be expecting more but willing to sacrifice less.\"\n\nHave taxes ever been cut during wartime?\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey found taxes have generally increased during war, but there are exceptions -- most notably in the last decade.\n\nThe mayor\u2019s spokeswoman said Booker was \"referring to the tax cuts that were enacted during the tenure of President [George W.] Bush,\" specifically reductions in the federal income tax rate.\n\nIn summer 2001, Bush, a Republican, lowered federal income tax rates and enacted other tax breaks. In 2003, amid wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Bush signed legislation that sped up the timeline for when those cuts took effect. \u00a0\n\nSo, taxes have been cut during wartime recently, but what about historically?\n\nThe national PolitiFact site researched a similar issue two years ago. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman said \"if you want to talk firsts for Bush, this was the first time in American history that a president took us into a war and cut taxes.\" \u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s review that article.\n\nPolitiFact started with the Civil War and found that then, as well as during World Wars I and II, taxes increased.\n\nCongress hasn\u2019t officially declared war since World War II, but PolitiFact also looked at taxes during the wars in Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf and Iraq. \u00a0\n\nDuring those wars, taxes were cut only once: President John F. Kennedy lowered the income tax rate in a bill that took effect in 1964. But experts dismissed the Kennedy tax cut because it was passed before the conflict in Vietnam seriously escalated -- and when the war intensified, taxes increased.\n\nPolitiFact also noted that in 2009 President Barack Obama signed the economic stimulus package, a bill with hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks. But Krugman said Bush was the first president that \"took us into war\" and cut taxes, whereas Obama inherited the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Krugman\u2019s statement was rated Mostly True.\n\nWe need to note two differences between what Krugman said and Booker\u2019s statement.\n\nFirst, Krugman made his statement in 2009, before the Bush tax cuts were extended under Obama. And second, Booker did not make the distinction, as Krugman did, that Bush was the first president to take us into war and cut taxes.\n\nSeveral experts we spoke with argued that in extending the Bush tax cuts, Obama maintained the status quo.\n\n\"If a tax rate is scheduled to go up and you don\u2019t allow it to rise, is that a tax cut or the avoidance of a tax increase? I consider it the extension of current law,\" said Scott Hodge, president of the Tax Foundation, a pro-business group.\n\nAs for the stimulus plan, some experts argued that the tax breaks included in the package differ from the Bush tax cuts because of how they worked or because they intended to jumpstart a weak economy.\n\nBut, Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, said they\u2019re still tax cuts\n\n\"I\u2019m of the opinion that if it is in the tax system, and if it raises or lowers your taxes, it is either a tax cut or a tax increase,\" he said.\n\nBut the measures enacted by Obama came during the same wartime -- the \"war on terrorism\" -- when Bush first reduced taxes.\n\nLet\u2019s recap.\n\nBooker claimed that \"for the first time ever we've gotten tax breaks during wartime.\"\n\nThe national PolitiFact website rated a claim that Bush was the first president to lead us into war and cut taxes Mostly True. Booker\u2019s spokeswoman told us the mayor was referring to the Bush tax cuts.\n\nThough Booker didn\u2019t make the same distinction Krugman did regarding Bush, we find his overall point sound.\u00a0\n\nTaxes technically were cut in 1964. But as the war in Vietnam escalated, taxes increased.\n\nSince the start of the \"war of terrorism,\" taxes have only gone down -- first under Bush, then under Obama"}

He repeated it during the July 13 debate with his three Democratic challengers, saying the city now has \"the lowest crime rate in three decades.\"\n\nIn addition, the mayor's website says, \"Under his leadership, Providence has seen crime drop to its lowest rate in 30 years.\"\n\nWe asked the campaign for numbers to support that assertion. They provided statistics collected by the Providence Police Department on various crimes going back to 1960.\n\nCicilline is basing the claim on the sum of all reports of murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft, which the police call the \"crime index.\"\n\nThose numbers show that in 2009, there were 9,252 such crimes reported in the capital city. The last time the number was that low was in 1965, when 8,521 crimes were logged in those categories. That's a span of 44 years.\n\nSo by that measure, Cicilline's claim is understated. The annual number of reported crimes hasn't been this low in more than four decades, not three.\n\nBut is the mayor's leadership responsible for that decline?\n\nWhen we invited Karen Watts, the mayor's director of communications, to address that issue, she responded in an email that, \"I think I'll just let the facts speak for themselves.\"\n\nWe compared the rise and fall of crimes in Providence to the national pattern, using numbers from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, part of the U.S. Department of Justice. Over the years, the Providence trends have been very similar to the U.S. numbers. The number of crime reports rose steadily, except for some sporadic dips, throughout the 1960s, '70s and '80s.\n\nAround 1990, things began to change. Nationally, the numbers began a gradual decline. Chris Menton, a professor of criminal justice at Roger Williams University, said there are lot of theories for the trend, but one of the most solid holds that when there are more young people in a population, the crime rate is higher.\n\n"}

In New York and Connecticut, Obama attended two events for the Democratic National Committee and one for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\nObama traveled to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York via Air Force One, which is the call sign for one of two 747 jets specially equipped with communications gear so the president is always able to respond in an emergency. According to a 2012 report from the Congressional Research Service, the policy arm of Congress, the hourly cost of Air Force One is $179,750. On domestic trips, a cargo aircraft and a backup aircraft normally accompany Air Force One.\nFor the purposes of Trump\u2019s calculation, that would put the total cost of the air travel between $360,000 and $1.6 million, assuming a range of two and nine hours of usage time for Air Force One.\nNote: Under the rules of presidential travel, when the purpose of a trip is political, not official, the president\u2019s political organization reimburses the government. For airfare, the price is based on the cost of a commercial ticket for the president and all those who accompany him. In this case, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee would be on the hook.\nIn addition to the aircraft, there would have been a Secret Service cost, but those figures are classified. There also would be security costs for the New York Police Department.\nTo get a fuller picture of what the cost of presidential travel is, we have to go back to 1999 for a more comprehensive accounting. That year, the Government Accountability Office, Congress\u2019s auditing division, looked at the price tag for three foreign trips taken by President Bill Clinton. Again, these numbers don\u2019t include the Secret Service\u00a0expenses, or the pre-trip planning. But they do include pretty much everything else. (We adjusted the 1998 dollars to account for inflation.)\n\n\n\n\n\nTrip\n\n\nTotal days\n\n\nDaily cost (2014 dollars)\n\n\n\n\nAfrica - six nations\n\n"}

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Peter DeFazio Oregon families pay an extra $1,400 a year on higher insurance premiums to cover those who do not have insurance.", "evidence": "Don\u2019t look now, but the health care debate, in all its high-decibel, combustible glory is revving up again. The House has already approved a bill calling for the 2010 law to be repealed. The Senate considered a similar proposal but Democrats defeated it.\n\nAnd now, Rep. Peter DeFazio is stepping into the battle with legislation that would dismantle a central element of the law -- the so-called \"individual mandate\" that requires every American to carry health insurance.\n\nDeFazio says doing away with the requirement would end legal challenges questioning its constitutionality and save people money.\n\n\"Congress can quickly resolve the issues of constitutionality and the limits of the federal government by reforming the individual mandate with an opt-out clause that allows for full personal responsibility. I believe buying insurance should be a choice, not a matter of federal coercion,\" DeFazio writes in a Feb. 1, \"Dear Colleague\" letter.\n\nMoney, though, is a central element of his pitch. \"Oregon families pay an extra $1,400 a year ... on higher insurance premiums to cover those who do not have insurance,\" DeFazio wrote in his letter.\n\nThe clear inference is that if a person voluntarily decides to live without health insurance, the rest of us are off the hook if something bad happens.\n\n\"If they waive their right to the federal health care backstop, then they alone are burdened with their future health care costs,\" DeFazio writes.\n\nIt\u2019s a clever device that accentuates the emotional argument while conveniently side-stepping some important nuances.\n\nFirst is the question of cost. DeFazio\u2019s claim that the average Oregonian with insurance absorbs a $1,400 surcharge to cover those without insurance is correct. The practice is called cost shifting and it means that those who have insurance pay higher rates than necessary to cover the cost of those who do not.\n\nDeFazio\u2019s letter suggests, but does not explicitly say, that people\u2019s health insurance premiums would cost less if the mandate is removed. The reason, he says in the letter, is that anyone who makes the choice not to carry insurance would have to sign an affidavit and agree to pay all medical costs.\n\nMultiple studies over the years have analyzed the practice. Most agree that nationally, the cost of health insurance for a family is $1,100 higher as a result of the uninsured. (Politicians from both sides have used the figure, including President Barack Obama.)\n\nOne of the first studies came in 2005 from the interest group, FamiliesUSA, which calculated the cost to a family would be $992. Ironically, the group cited that surcharge as a reason for requiring everybody to have insurance since that would spread the cost -- and the coverage -- over a larger population.\n\nAs the health care debate intensified, the 2005 work was updated. In 2008, the left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress calculated that the \"hidden tax\" jumped, on average, to $1,000. It also provided state-by-state estimates, with the surcharge in Oregon calculated to be $1,400.\n\n\"This \u2018hidden tax\u2019 on health insurance arises from a failure to continuously cover all Americans and accounts for roughly 8 percent of the average health insurance premium. This cost-shift amounts to $1,100 per average family premium in 2009 and $410 per average individual premium,\" the center said in a 2009 report.\n\nSo it\u2019s well established and mostly beyond debate that premiums for those with health insurance are higher to absorb some of the cost for those who don\u2019t have it.\n\nBut things break down for those like DeFazio, who try to draw a straight-line cause and effect.\n\n\"We do not necessarily assume that the private revenues used to subsidize care to the uninsured inevitably cause higher private payments and insurance premiums,\" the Kaiser Family Foundation study found.\n\n\"In particular, the Families USA approach omits the possibility that providers who treat substantial numbers of uninsured people have lower profits. In fact, we are highly skeptical that the high and growing cost of private insurance is strongly related, if at all, to the amount of uncompensated care delivered by private providers or to the growing number of uninsured people,\" Kaiser analysts concluded.\n\nDeFazio\u2019s claim about the \"hidden tax\" is based in fact but he fails to provide sufficient nuance to a complex and emotionally wrought question"}
{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Rob Teilhet Said he is the only Democratic candidate for state attorney general who has \"represented the entire state of Georgia.\"", "evidence": "Politicians are always looking for an edge in a close race. In the contest between the two Democrats for attorney general, candidate Rob Teilhet is using his time under the Gold Dome to try to claim an advantage over his opponent, Ken Hodges.Elected four consecutive times since 2002 to serve a portion of Cobb County in the Georgia Legislature, Teilhet said in a questionnaire that he \"represented\" the entire state.\"As the only Democratic candidate (for attorney general) who has represented the entire state of Georgia, I'm uniquely positioned to introduce and implement groundbreaking public policy designed to curtail crime, consumer fraud and public corruption,\" Teilhet wrote.We were curious about this one. Teilhet explained.\"You are elected to represent a district, but you also serve the state of Georgia,\" he said.Teilhet pointed us to the oath of office for the 180-member state House of Representatives.Here's the first part of the oath: \"I do hereby solemnly swear or affirm that I will support the Constitution of this state and of the United States and, on all questions and measures which may come before me, I will so conduct myself, as will, in my judgment, be most conducive to the interests and prosperity of this state.\"So does Teilhet represent the entire state as he claimed?Teilhet was elected by voters from a portion of east Cobb County that includes Marietta, Smyrna and the Dobbins Air Reserve Base. He has been in the Legislature since 2003. The Hodges camp duly noted the boundaries of Teilhet's district as part of its argument against his claim.\"It's the first line in his campaign bio,\" Shannon Marietta, Hodges' campaign manager, wrote in an e-mail.Hodges, who served 12 years as Dougherty County's district attorney, had to pledge that he would support the Georgia Constitution.The state constitution says representatives should be elected from \"representative districts of the state.\" They have the power to write local legislation and the mandate to approve a balanced budget. They do not have the power to approve contracts or regulate charges for public utilities.Teilhet worked with other House members on about two dozen pieces of legislation earlier this year that were designed to have an impact across the state, such as a bill to take DNA samples of people accused of felonies -- that bill failed. A handful focused on issues that were of particular interest to Cobb residents, such as a bill imposing up to 20 years in prison for theft in a disaster area. Cobb County was hardest hit during September's record flooding. He also wrote about a dozen resolutions that ranged from commending the county manager, David Hankerson, to honoring the South Cobb High School marching band for performing at President Barack Obama's inauguration.George Hooks, whose 20 years in the Georgia Senate is longer than that of any of his colleagues, said lawmakers have dual roles of representing the district and constituents across Georgia. Sometimes, Hooks said, he supports legislation that people in his South Georgia district may not like, but it benefits the state, such as a bill earlier this year that could offer new funding sources for transportation.\"I voted for it because I see it as benefiting the state,\" Hooks said. \"If it benefits Atlanta, it will benefit the state.\"University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock, whom Teilhet said was one of his college professors, said some representatives work as \"trustees,\" serving the interests of everyone. Others act as \"delegates,\" taking care of the people in their home district.Steve Anthony, who has worked at the state Capitol and is a lecturer at Georgia State University, believes Teilhet is \"playing loose with verbiage.\" \"If he had said he represented the interests of the state of Georgia, he would be correct,\" Anthony said. \"He didn't represent Georgia. He represented the interests of Georgia.\"Anthony also took issue with the second part of Teilhet's statement, saying the candidate cannot introduce legislation as attorney general. \"He can get some friend to introduce it for him.\"Teilhet replied: \"By that standard, the governor has never introduced a bill.\"Teilhet and others have different interpretations about the role of members of the Georgia House of Representatives. The state constitution does not say whether representatives are elected to serve the entire state. The oath does say that representatives should work toward goals that are \"conducive to the interests and prosperity of this state.\" Teilhet said he has talked on the campaign trail about the oath of office directing representatives to serve the interests of the state. \"Maybe that would have been a little tighter [to say in the questionnaire],\" Teilhet said. We agree that Teilhet would have been better served if he said he represented the \"interests\" of the state. As even Hooks said, Teilhet's statement is \"broad"}

{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Joseph McNamara \"About 22 percent of adults in Rhode Island and approximately 30 percent of youth (ages 10-17) are considered obese.\"", "evidence": "Obesity is a heavy topic. Too many extra pounds add to our risk of heart disease, diabetes, stroke, sleep disturbances and a host of other problems. Research shows that, as a nation, we are getting fatter.\n\nThat's more than a problem just for people who are overweight. When obesity levels rise and the population becomes less healthy, it drives up health costs, which affect all of us.\n\nBut is it really true that more than 1 in 5 Rhode Islanders and nearly one-third of our teens and preteens aren't just overweight, they're obese?\n\nThat was the contention of Rep. Joseph McNamara, a Warwick Democrat, when he introduced bills requiring restaurants to provide more nutrition information in hopes of combating the problem.\n\n\"About 22 percent of adults in Rhode Island and approximately 30 percent of youth (ages 10-17) are considered obese,\" he is quoted as saying in a legislative news release.\n\nObesity is determined by your body-mass index, a number that's cumbersome to calculate, in part because it's often defined in metric units, which is one reason why many people don't know what their BMI is.\n\n(To calculate your BMI, take your weight in pounds and multiply it by 703. Next, convert your height to inches and multiply that number by itself. So if you\u2019re 65 inches tall, multiply 65 by 65 to get 4,225. \u00a0Then, you take the weight number and divide it by the height number, you get your BMI. Alternatively, you can go online at www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/ and have the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute do the calculation for you.)\n\nIf your body-mass index is 25 or higher, you're overweight. If the number is 30 or higher, you're obese. In easier-to-understand terms, a 5-feet-2-inches tall, 164-pound person is obese. So is a 6-footer who weighs 221 pounds.\n\nWhen we called McNamara's office to find out if that many Rhode Islanders really score 30 or more, we were directed to an online report from Eliza Lawson of the Health Department's Initiative for a Healthy Weight. Lawson, in turn, said McNamara's numbers are supported by reports based on the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.\n\nThe state-by-state rankings compiled in 2009 by the Trust for America's Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation show that Rhode Island has an adult obesity rate of 21.7 percent, which would round up to the 22 percent cited by McNamara.\n\nThe 2009 report also offers statistics for children age 10-17. That's where we found a Rhode Island number of 30.1 percent, matching McNamara\u2019s number.\n\nBut there's one big problem.\n\nThat 30.1 percent figure isn\u2019t for obese children. It includes all overweight children.\n\nTo get the correct number for obese children, we went to the 2010 version of the report, which shows that the obesity rate for Rhode Island's youth, based on a 2007 survey, is much lower than McNamara states -- 14.4 percent.\n\nSo how does Rhode Island rank?\n\nAs adults, we have one of the lowest obesity rates in the United States. In the 2009 report, we were 48th among the 50 states and the District of Columbia; only Connecticut, Massachusetts and Colorado had lower obesity rates. In 2010, our obesity rate rose by 1.2 percentage points and we moved to 45th.\n\nRhode Island's teens and preteens ranked 28th, essentially at the national average.\n\n(The adult percentages have a margin of error of plus or minus 0.9 percentage points. The childhood percentages, because the numbers are small, have a larger margin of error: plus or minus 3.2 points.)\n\nWhen we told McNamara that the data showed a much lower rate among children than he had cited, he produced a copy of an \"Eat Smart, Move More\" newsletter that gives the 30-percent figure. But that newsletter incorrectly quotes a 2010 Rhode Island Department of Health report, which had the correct figures on overweight and obesity.\n\nIn summary, McNamara's assessment of adult obesity in Rhode Island is correct, if a bit outdated, and he fails to note that Rhode Island ranks as healthier than a large majority of other states. But his statistic on childhood obesity is way off - roughly half of what he said it was"}

He or she could be accused of manslaughter, the unlawful killing of someone without malice. That could mean killing in the heat of the moment, or accidentally causing someone\u2019s death.\nThird, these numbers reflect ICE's administrative arrests, meaning the agency's officers arrested the immigrants for a civil violation of U.S. immigration laws, not for murder.\nFourth, and perhaps most importantly, the 2,028 figure doesn\u2019t represent the number of crimes committed in a given year.\n\n"}

Common scenarios that led to exonerations include cases where evidence was withheld by the prosecution, or where the defendant had ineffective trial counsel and then got a new trial that resulted in acquittal or dropped charges, said Richard Dieter, executive director of the center.

{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Rod Smith Says Rick Scott's proposed budget \"would lay off 20,000 teachers.\"", "evidence": "In his first State of the State address, Florida Gov. Rick Scott boldly told legislators that he has created the \"most fiscally conservative state budget in the country.\"\n\n\"Our jobs budget is targeted to create private-sector jobs, increase accountability and reduce the size of government,\" Scott told a joint session of the Legislature on March 8, 2011.\n\nMoments after Scott finished his 27-minute address, Florida Democratic Party Chairman Rod Smith offered a dramatically different interpretation of Scott's spending plan.\n\n\"Since he took office, Floridians have seen that Rick Scott only cares about imposing his rigid and extreme philosophy on our state, rather than working to implement common-sense solutions for Florida,\" Smith said in a statement. \"Whether he is killing high-speed rail, proposing his spending plan that would lay off 20,000 teachers, or putting communities at risk by ending critical law enforcement tools to stop pill-mills, Rick Scott's agenda is doing real harm to our state.\"\n\nThe thing that jumped out at us in Smith's claim is that Scott's budget \"would lay off 20,000 teachers\" -- a huge amount. We'll explain how huge in a minute.\n\nBudget cuts don't spare education\n\nTo balance the state budget as required in the Constitution, lawmakers must trim at least $3.62 billion from this year's $70.5 billion budget. Scott's proposal goes further -- reducing the budget by $4.6 billion to $65.9 billion.\n\nPreK-12 education funding is hardly spared as part of Scott's proposed cuts.\n\nScott's budget proposal for 2011-12 reduces the total amount of state PreK-12 education funding from $18.2 billion, to $16.5 billion -- a total cut of about $1.7 billion. That number includes local property taxes the state mandates school boards collect (the required local effort), the state contribution from sales tax revenues and trust funds, and federal dollars passed through the state.\n\nThe cuts break down this way (we're rounding a bit, so everything might not add up exactly):\n\n\u2022 The state's contribution would remain the same at about $8.9 billion.\n\n\u2022 Required local education taxes would shrink by about $660 million, and discretionary local taxes would shrink an additional $200 million -- shrinking the local contribution from about $8.4 billion to nearly $7.5 billion.\n\n\u2022 And the state also would not replace about $873 million in federal stimulus funds.\n\nIn total, Scott's budget proposals would reduce the amount of per-student funding by 10.19 percent, from about $6,900 per student to nearly $6,200 per student. (Some of that reduction could be offset for one year, Scott says, by requiring teachers to pay 5 percent of their salary toward their retirement and by using temporary federal funds given to school districts in 2010.)\n\nScott budget chief Jerry McDaniel has told lawmakers that the proposed budget would result in some teacher layoffs, though he did not offer a hard estimate. The budget document itself -- while cutting funding -- also does not explicitly say school districts should lay off 20,000 teachers.\n\nSo we turned to Smith's spokesman, Eric Jotkoff, to understand where the figure came from.\n\nBasis of Smith's 20,000 teacher-layoff claim\n\nJotkoff said the figure originated from an article that appeared in the Gainesville Sun on Feb. 21, 2011, aptly titled \"Worst-case scenario for education is 20,000 layoffs in Florida.\"\n\nThe article itself doesn't cite the origin of the 20,000-teacher layoff number; rather, it details Scott's proposed cuts, including a nearly 10 percent reduction in per-pupil education spending.\n\n\"While promising to create a world-class education system, Gov. Rick Scott has simultaneously proposed the deepest cuts for Florida public schools by any governor in recent history,\" the article states. \"In a worst-case scenario, they would lead to more than 20,000 layoffs of teachers and other personnel in the state's 67 school districts.\"\n\nThe article does acknowledge that Scott's complementary proposal to make teachers contribute to their retirement could free up local school district dollars to offset some of the proposed education funding cuts.\n\nJotkoff referenced numbers presented in the article to help make his case.\n\n\u2022 $1.75 billion -- the total of PreK-12 education funding cuts (we say $1.7 billion because of the way we rounded the numbers).\n\n\u2022 80 percent -- the percentage of education funds that the article says goes to personnel costs (we're not stating that number as fact and the Sun article didn't cite a source).\n\n\u2022 $46,708 -- the average salary of a Florida teacher (a figure generated by the National Education Association).\n\nJotkoff said that if 80 percent of education spending is for personnel costs, that represents $1.4 billion of the overall proposed cuts. Divide those cuts by the average salary of a teacher and that equates to the salaries of 29,973 teachers -- even more than cited in the Sun article.\n\nWe found two issues with that calculation, however. First, the salary figure does not include teacher benefits. Second, while Education Week has reported that about 80 percent of school districts' budgets are personnel costs, that is a broad estimate that could vary depending on the school district, and also includes school district employees who are not teachers.\n\nOn top of that, there's a much simpler way to measure the impact of Scott's proposed cuts on teachers.\n\nThe Florida Department of Education said that at the start of the 2010 school year, school districts employed 169,540 teachers and 22,924 additional workers classified as instructional staff, a group that includes guidance counselors, school social workers, librarians.\n\nThat's 192,464 people classified as \"instructional staff.\"\n\nUsing that number, Scott's 10.19 percent per-pupil funding cut would be the equivalent cut of 19,612 teachers and instructional staff. That's pretty close to the 20,000 teachers Smith is claiming would be fired under Scott's budget.\n\nBut you need to read the fine print.\n\nMore than just the numbers\n\nAs we've already said, Scott's budget cuts funding, not teachers. Specific cuts would be left to individual school districts.\n\nBut there are also two impediments to the large-scale teacher cuts Smith is warning of. The first is rooted in the state Constitution. In November 2002, Florida's voters approved an amendment to the Constitution that sets limits for the maximum number of students in a classroom starting with the 2010-11 school year. The Legislature tried to loosen the restriction through a second constitutional amendment in 2010, but the amendment failed to receive the needed 60 percent of voter approval.\n\nSince 2003, the state has spent about $16 billion to implement the amendment, mainly by hiring some 30,000 additional teachers. It would be virtually impossible to cut 20,000 teacher jobs and still comply with the constitutional mandate.\n\nSecond, Scott proposes making school district employees contribute 5 percent of their salary toward their retirement. He says employee contributions would free up local school district funding to brace against some of the other education cuts. If that proposal were to pass, school districts would effectively see a per-pupil funding cut of about $505, Scott says, a 7.36 percent reduction. That would be the equivalent of 14,165 teachers and instructional staff.\n\nBut again, that doesn't mean that will be how many get laid off if Scott's education plan passes.\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn offering a counter to Scott's budget message of fiscal restraint, Smith says Scott wants to recklessly lay off 20,000 teachers.\n\nScott is proposing major cuts to education funding. And even Scott's budget chief acknowledges layoffs will occur.\n\nBut trying to estimate a number is tricky. Yes, you can divide the number of teachers and instructional staff by proposed per-pupil cuts to reach a figure, but that ignores the Florida Constitution, which requires small class sizes, and local school district decisions, in how they will spend their money. Also, Scott's proposal to make school district employees contribute to their retirement could dilute some of the cuts being pushed by Scott.\n\nThat said, Scott's budget plan would strip a significant chunk of funding out of school districts, equivalent to the amount of around 20,000 teachers"}

Robin Vos, the Republican from Rochester who was elected Nov. 13, 2012 as speaker of the state Assembly.\n\nVos made clear in a recent WisPolitics interview that his top priority is a middle-class income tax cut.\n\n\"If you\u2019re poor in Wisconsin, it is one of the best places in the country to be poor. We\u2019re in the bottom 10 states as far as paying taxes if you\u2019re poor,\" Vos said in the interview. \"If you\u2019re successful, we are in the middle. I think we\u2019re number 15 or 16 ...\"\n\n\"But if you\u2019re a person in the middle class, somebody who makes $20,000 to $200,000, you\u2019re in the top 4 or 5 worst places in the country to be a middle-class income taxpayer.\"\n\nVos went on to tell WisPolitics that Republicans want an across-the-board income-tax cut, though the \"primary benefits\" would go to the middle class. When we asked him to clarify what he meant, he told us fiscal constraints might preclude -- for now -- reducing income tax rates on upper-income earners for whom legislative Democrats and Gov. Jim Doyle raised the top rate in 2010.\n\nSo, is Vos right about how the income tax burden affects low and middle-income earners?\n\nWhen asked for backup, Vos pointed us to research presented to the bipartisan Steering Committee on Income Tax, a study group chaired by Vos that was set up through the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Council.\n\nLower-income workers: Vos said their income tax burden is in the bottom 10, and it\u2019s clear from the complete interview he meant among the 41 states that levy a personal income tax.\n\nIn a November 2009 study, the nonpartisan, liberal Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) ranked the burden on the lowest one-fifth of Wisconsin\u2019s earners as the 29th-lowest among those 41 states.\n\nThat\u2019s not quite bottom 10, but the group\u2019s executive Matthew Gardner told us the difference between Wisconsin and the lowest rung of the bottom 10 was so \"trivially small\" as to be meaningless.\n\nAnother 50-state study, by the Minnesota Taxpayers Association in 2011, ranked the low-income burden in Wisconsin as either 32nd- or 34th-lowest for married couples at $10,000 or $20,000. Both are bottom 10.\n\nIn Wisconsin, as in several other states, the working poor often have a \"negative\" income tax bill -- they get tax credits that wipe out their tax liability and in some cases result in a payment to them from the state.\n\nWisconsin would be lower in these rankings, but some states pay even larger credits.\n\nMiddle-income earners: Vos said this group faces a top-five burden.\n\nIncome taxes paid by Wisconsin married couples and single heads of household in the $75,000 to $100,000 income range are fifth-highest in the country, based on the Minnesota study. The Wisconsin Department of Revenue indirectly cited the Minnesota study in testimony before the Vos-chaired study group.\n\nA sub-group of all married couples -- senior couples making $100,000 -- have the fourth-highest.\n\nThe Minnesota group\u2019s research director, Aaron Twait, said he considers the $100,000 mark for two earners a classic middle-class household, based on average incomes in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nIn addition, the ITEP study shows only four states collecting a higher average tax rate than Wisconsin in the $57,000-$88,000 range.\n\nSo Vos has evidence to back up this part of his claim.\n\nBut when you look at other levels within Vos\u2019s middle-class range of $20,000 to $200,000, the burden is not quite as heavy as Vos said.\n\nFor example, at the $150,000 level in the Minnesota study, the rankings are No. 10 for singles, No. 8 for married couples filing jointly and No. 9 for single heads of household. Again, that\u2019s among the 41 states with an income tax.\n\nAt $50,000, we found a mix of rankings between No. 3 and No. 7.\n\nFinally, Vos mentioned one other income group, the \"successful,\" by which he meant upper-income. It\u2019s not part of the claim we\u2019re testing, but Vos said that group\u2019s income-tax burden was in the middle of the 41 states.\n\nThat\u2019s basically on target. We found tax-burden rankings from No. 11 to No. 17 for top earners in categories such as $250,000, $500,000 and $1 million annual income. These rankings were from the Minnesota study. The ITEP study also shows the rankings falling as income rises.\n\nOur rating\n\nVos said that when it comes to income taxes, Wisconsin is \"one of the best places in the country to be poor\" but \"top 4 or 5 worst\" for middle-income earners.\n\nHe\u2019s mostly on target here, based on credible tax studies showing a very low burden on the working poor, compared to a very high burden on many middle-income earners.\n\nNot all the middle-income earners face a top-5 tax burden, though: It\u2019s top-10 for some in the middle-class as he defined it"}

The comparison refers to average price paid by a full-time student for one year of undergraduate enrollment.\nFor 2014-15, the lowest was Wyoming at $4,646, followed by Arkansas at $6,138; Utah at $6,177; New Mexico at $6,190; Montana at $6,279, and then Florida at $6,351.

Basically, Sanders had two opportunities to show his support for auto bailout funds through Senate votes. He supported the bailout in one instance but not the other.\nIn October 2008, Congress approved the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The money was intended to assist financial institutions, but it also ended up bailing out the auto industry.\nThat December, Congress tried to pass a separate $14 billion bailout program specifically for the auto industry, which was in really bad shape. But the measure failed in the Senate, so President George W. Bush instead used his authority to allocate some of the TARP funds to General Motors and Chrysler.\nJust days before President Barack Obama started his first term in January 2009, some members of Congress tried to block the release of the the second half of the $700 billion TARP funds, a package that included some auto bailout money. The attempt failed, and the TARP funds went out to the banks and motor companies.\nSo Sanders could have shown his support for the auto bailout in December 2008 when Congress tried and failed to pass an auto bailout and again in January 2009 when members considered blocking TARP funds.\nSanders (and Clinton, too) voted in favor of the December separate auto bailout.\n\n"}

One program is aimed at reintegrating homeless veterans back into society, another provides health care, one offers dental care, and another identifies and coordinates services.\n\nWithin Veterans Affairs, we found a Compensated Work Theory that, according to the FY 2009 report, \"endeavors to match and support work-ready veterans in competitive jobs, and to consult business and industry regarding their specific employment needs.\" The VA budgeted $26.6 million toward that program. The Labor Department has a Veterans' Reintegration Program, which is \"the only nationwide program exclusively focused on assisting homeless veterans reintegrate into the workforce.\" Its budget was $26.3 million.\n\nThe federal Health and Human Services Department has two programs that, in part, try to assist homeless people with mental health issues.

That\u2019s the second-highest number of cases reported in the United States since the contagious virus was eliminated from the country in 2000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nBut a Facebook post from that same day cast doubt on the seriousness of this measles outbreak compared with the risks of the vaccine that the CDC recommends be administered to all children to inoculate them against measles, mumps and rubella, commonly referred to as the MMR vaccine.\n\"Measles kills 11 people in 19 years (since 2000),\" the post says. \"MMR vaccine kills 445 infants in 1 year (since 2018). Why aren\u2019t you afraid of vaccine?\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe post includes a link to a blog called \"The Mom Street Journal.\" But the blog post \u2014 \"Doctors disagree with charges against Dr. Bob Sears, assert vaccine safety is a concern\" \u2014 is from 2016, two years before the earliest baseline date cited in the Facebook post. It also doesn\u2019t mention measles.\nWe asked Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute For Vaccine Safety at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, about the Facebook post.\n\"It\u2019s not true,\" he said.\nFirst, let\u2019s look at measles deaths.\nSince 2017, approximately 110,000 people worldwide died from measles, according to the World Health Organization. Before the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1963, widespread epidemics happened every two to three years or so, and an estimated 2.6 million people died annually.\nBecause the Facebook post claims measles has killed 11 people since 2000, a fraction of the number of people who died from measles globally, we\u2019ll focus our fact-check on the United States.\nBenjamin Haynes, a spokesman for the CDC\u2019s infectious disease media team, said three people have died from measles since 2000. Two people died in 2003, Haynes said, and one more died in 2015.\nNext, let\u2019s look at the Facebook post\u2019s claim that the Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine killed 445 infants in one year, \"since 2018.\"\nHaynes said the CDC doesn\u2019t have precise data on deaths caused by the MMR vaccination.\n\"CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) monitor reports of adverse events and deaths that occur after vaccination using several different systems including the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS),\" Haynes said. \"Since VAERS data cannot determine causality, we cannot use it to provide numbers of severe injuries or deaths caused by vaccination.\"\n\n"}
{"label": "false", "claim": "Victoria Taft \"A $250 fine if you're caught with a plastic bag coming out of a store. Plastic bag police anyone?\"", "evidence": "On Monday, talk-radio host and conservative Victoria Taft sent two tweets regarding a proposed plastic bag ban pending in Salem. The first: \"$250 fine for possession of plastic bag if ban goes thru.\" The second: \"\u2018Plastic\u2019 Bag Ban: A $250 fine if you're caught with a plastic bag coming out of a store. Plastic bag police anyone?#5vtshow.\"\nPolitiFact Oregon knows that under proposed legislation there would be a 5-cent charge for each paper bag. But a $250 fine for mere possession of a bag? A plastic bag police? Those were intriguing concepts.\n\nTaft has received one Pants on Fire and one False from PolitiFact Oregon, so we understand her reluctance to talk to us about her tweets. (Her email response to our query asked more questions than it answered.) That said, we did some checking and found that the $250 fine is rooted in reality: It\u2019s the penalty levied on a retailer -- not a shopper -- for continuing to hand out single-use plastic bags at checkout.\n\nPalmer Mason, a legislative analyst with the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, said if the ban becomes law, the agency likely would use the first year not to fine, but to educate retailers on a new bag ban.\n\n\"This is a huge behavioral change.This affects most of the retail transactions in the state of Oregon and it will take time for consumers and retailers and for the industry to change their behavior and change what they\u2019ve been doing for many years,\" he said.\n\n(That said, Mason wants retailers to know that DEQ isn\u2019t afraid to ticket flagrant flouters in year one.)\n\nTo be absolutely fair to Taft, the original language of Senate Bill 536 states that DEQ \"may impose a civil penalty on a person\" who violates Section 2 -- but again, Section 2 applies to retailers and what the establishments may or may not provide in terms of checkout bags. And, an amendment dated March 3, way before she tweeted, clarifies the original bill to strike out the words \"a person\" and replace the term with \"a retail establishment.\"\n\nTaft is right when she says there is a $250 fine for plastic bag abuse. But her second tweet, which \u00a0reads in part -- \"a $250 fine if you're caught with a plastic bag coming out of a store\" -- gives the impression that the individual shopper would be fined for possessing a plastic bag. And that\u2019s just not true.\n\nWe would give Taft\u2019s tweet a Pants on Fire if she had plucked the amount of the fine out of thin air. We could give this a Barely True, in that the statement contained an element of truth -- the $250 fine -- but failed to mention that it applied to retailers, which would have given a different impression.\n\nBut instead, we rate her statement a False. A shopper who is \"caught with a plastic bag\" does not merit a fine, and indeed, it may not even merit the retailer a fine since shoppers are allowed to bring in their own bags. DEQ officials will not be prowling supermarket exits to pounce on single-use plastic bag users. The statement is not accurate.\n\u00a0\n\n"}
{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Newt Gingrich In every committee when the health care bill was considered, Democrats voted against an amendment that would require members of Congress and their staff to take the government-run public option as their health care plan.", "evidence": "To build opposition to a public health insurance option, Republicans have been challenging Democratic lawmakers and White House officials to enroll in the government-run plan.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"If Members of Congress believe so strongly that government-run health care is the best solution for hard working American families, I think it only fitting that Americans see them lead the way,\" said Republican Rep. John Fleming, who is sponsoring a resolution encouraging lawmakers to enroll in the public option, in a statement on his Web site.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOn the Aug. 9, 2009, episode of\n\nThis Week\n\n, Former Speaker Newt Gingrich told host George Stephanopoulos that Democrats are squarely against the idea.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"An amendment was offered in every committee to ... have the members of Congress and their staff in any government option as a mandate. And if this is good enough for the American people, it's good enough for the politicians,\" Gingrich said. \"In every committee, the Democrats voted no. Now, why is it they want to insist on a government-run system for ... people other than the Congress, but the Congress and their staff would be exempt?\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe wondered whether Gingrich's vote count was correct. To find out, we sifted through all the health care amendments offered in the House and the Senate committees.\n\n\nCurrently, members of Congress receive health insurance under the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program, which offers plans that range from basic coverage to plans that pay for special treatments and drugs. The system has earned high markets for efficiency, making it one of the models the White House has studied in coming up with its own ideas for health care reform.\n\n\nIt's important to note that under the Democrats' plan, the public option is just one choice that people would have in the health care exchange. The public option would provide basic coverage, but other plans would offer more extensive coverage likely at a higher price. Under the legislation now pending in Congress, no one would be forced to take the public option.\n\n\nAn amendment offered during the House Ways and Means Committee July 16 debate of the bill would have changed all that \u2014 but just for members of Congress and their staffs. Nevada Republican Dean Heller offered an amendment that would have required them to take the public plan. His amendment was rejected 18-21, with 21 of the 26 Democrats on the committee voting against it.\n\n\n"}
{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Newt Gingrich \"I never lobbied under any circumstance\" for Freddie Mac.", "evidence": "Is Newt Gingrich a conservative firebrand who can take the fight to Obama? Or just more Washington same-old, same-old?\n\nPut Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., down for the second option. She laid into him at a Republican debate for the presidential nomination for his work with Freddie Mac, a mortgage company giant connected to the federal government.\n\n\"Well, it's the fact that we know that he cashed paychecks from Freddie Mac. That's the best evidence that you can have, over $1.6 million,\" Bachmann said on Dec. 15, 2011, in Iowa. She added, \"We can't have as our nominee for the Republican Party someone who continues to stand for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. They need to be shut down, not built up.\"\n\nWhen asked for his response, Gingrich, the former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, said, \"Well, the easiest answer is, that's just not true. What she just said is factually not true. I never lobbied under any circumstance. I never went in and suggested in any way that we do this.\"\n\nThe conversation got weird after that, with Bachmann claiming that \"after the debates that we had last week, PolitiFact came out and said that everything that I said was true.\" That\u2019s not true, and we gave her a Pants on Fire for saying it.\n\nGingrich, meanwhile, said his policy now is to break up both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. He also claimed that he was too well off to sell influence: \"I want to state unequivocally, for every person watching tonight, I have never once changed my positions because of any kind of payment, because the truth is, I was a national figure who was doing just fine, doing a whole variety of things, including writing best-selling books, making speeches.\"\n\nHere, we decided to examine Gingrich\u2019s statement, \"I never lobbied under any circumstance.\"\n\nOur research showed that Gingrich is technically correct: If you search public records databases for registered lobbyists, you won\u2019t find Gingrich\u2019s name.\n\nBut his statement doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.\n\nTo be clear, Gingrich acknowledges that he worked for Freddie Mac, and his campaign released a statement affirming that Nov. 6, 2011.\n\nThe statement, which you can read in full, said that Gingrich\u2019s consulting group was retained by Freddie Mac in 2006. \"To be clear, Speaker Gingrich did no lobbying of any kind, nor did his firm. This was expressly written into the Gingrich Group contracts. Instead, the Gingrich Group was hired to offer strategic advice to Freddie Mac on a number of issues,\" the statement said.\n\nThe statement said Gingrich advised Freddie that it was dangerous to buy mortgage-backed securities based on questionable home loans. He also told Freddie on how to lower prescription drug costs for its employees. Finally, Freddie Mac \"was interested in advice on how to reach out to more conservatives.\"\n\nBecause he was not a registered lobbyist, neither Freddie Mac nor Gingrich is required to disclose how much Gingrich was paid nor the exact dates of his work. Bachmann said it was $1.6 million. This number likely came from news stories from Bloomberg News, which reported last month that Gingrich received between $1.6 million and $1.8 million in fees from two separate contracts. We've seen nothing questioning the accuracy of that report, but the number also came from unnamed sources, so we can\u2019t confirm or refute the number Bachmann mentioned.\nBloomberg also reported that Gingrich worked with Mitchell Delk, Freddie's chief lobbyist. Delk told Bloomberg that Gingrich provided \"counsel on public policy issues,\" but did not do formal lobbying work.\n\nSo Gingrich was paid for \"strategic advice\" without having to register as a lobbyist. How does that work?\n\nTo be a registered lobbyist, one has to meet a number of detailed rules laid out in federal law. One of the main rules is that a person has to register if he or she holds two or more meetings with elected officials or staff in any quarter of the year n behalf of a client. Also, the lobbying activities must constitute 20 percent or more of the lobbyist\u2019s time during any three-month period. (Want more detail? Read 27 pages of guidance on disclosing lobbying activities via the U.S. Senate website.)\n\nExperts we spoke with and the research we reviewed showed the \"strategic advice\" category is a way of using influence without having to register as a lobbyist.\n\nThey said strategic advisers can do quite a bit for clients like Freddie Mac without acquiring the lobbyist label. They can stay at the client\u2019s office and give their best advice on with whom to meet and what to say. They can give instructions to someone who is a registered lobbyist, again telling the lobbyist with whom to meet and what points to address. They can take their clients to meetings with groups that aren\u2019t part of the government, such as grassroots political groups. They can even have one big meeting with an elected official to make a case for a client.\n\n\"There\u2019s a lot of activity that ordinary people would think of as lobbying that doesn\u2019t trigger the obligation to register as a lobbyist under federal law. Strategic advice is one of those kinds of things that doesn\u2019t,\" said Joseph Sandler, an attorney with the Washington law firm Sandler Reiff Young & Lamb.\n\nSandler was one of four co-chairs of an American Bar Association task force that recommended changes to federal lobbying laws to improve disclosure and reduce conflicts of interest. One of its recommendations was that people who give strategic advice disclose their work under a new category of \"lobbying support.\"\n\nWe should also note that both parties play this game. Former U.S. Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., was a \"policy adviser\" at the lobbying firms Alston & Bird and DLA Piper. He had to answer many questions about his work when President Barack Obama selected him to be U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. (Daschle ended up withdrawing over tax issues connected to another client giving him the use of a car and driver.)\n\n\"Newt Gingrich is certainly not alone among well-heeled political players who say they just offer consulting services or strategic advice -- without needing to register as lobbyists. But it's a stretch to claim that they aren't part of the influence game,\" said Michael Beckel, a spokesman with the Center for Responsive Politics, via e-mail. The nonpartisan group monitors lobbying and campaign spending.\n\n\"The distinction isn't as important as Gingrich is making it out to be,\" he added.\n\nOur ruling\n\nGingrich is technically correct that he was not a registered lobbyist for Freddie Mac. But it appears he took pains to avoid being subject to the rules. Giving strategic advice is widely considered a way of using political influence without having to register"}

{"label": "true", "claim": "American Crossroads \"The Clintons' foundation took millions from foreign governments\" including United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.", "evidence": "A group founded by Karl Rove launched one of the first salvos of the 2016 presidential election cycle with a Web video attacking presumed Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton.\nAmerican Crossroads released a video Feb. 23 that features audio of a speech from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat from the party\u2019s progressive wing, warning that \"powerful interests have tried to capture Washington and rig the system in their favor.\" The video shows photos of Clinton meeting with various foreign delegates and leaders.\nText on the screen alleges that \"the Clintons' foundation took millions from foreign governments\" including \"up to $5 million\" from the United Arab Emirates and \"up to $25 million\" from Saudi Arabia.\nWe should note off the bat that Warren's remarks were ripped from two separate speeches aimed at\u00a0limiting money from corporations and Super PACs in politics, and they were merged together and cut in such a way to eliminate those references. They certainly weren't about Clinton or foundations or foreign governments.\nStill, we wanted to check whether Bill and Hillary Clinton's\u00a0foundation has indeed received large sums of money from foreign governments.\nFormer President Bill Clinton started the William J. Clinton Foundation in 2001 as a nonprofit philanthropy for global development. The organization partners with government, non-government organizations and businesses to tackle quality-of-life issues, such as AIDS, poverty and climate change.\nWhen Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009, the foundation agreed to disclose its donors at the request of the White House. According to a memorandum of understanding, the foundation could continue to collect donations from countries with which it had existing relationships or running grant programs. If contributions from those countries increased significantly or a new foreign government wanted to make a donation, the State Department would have to first approve (more on that in a bit).\nWe should emphasize there is nothing illegal about the contributions. Candidates for office are prohibited by law from accepting campaign contributions from foreign governments, but foundations have no such restriction. The main issue is that the foundation presented ethical quandaries when Clinton was a candidate for president in 2008 and when she was Secretary of State. But at this time, the foundation was her husband\u2019s project, not hers.\nThat changed when Clinton left the State Department. In 2013, the foundation became the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton foundation, with Hillary Clinton taking an active role in fundraising.\nThroughout the years, donors have included celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz, businesses like eBay and Pepsi, and other nonprofits, like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. And, yes, some governments.\nSo which countries and foreign governments have donated to her organization? Not just Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, it turns out.\nWe pulled the information from the Clinton Foundation website, which tracks donors by contribution range. As it is, we don\u2019t have exact amount for each donation, nor do we know when the contribution was made \u2014 except donations made in 2014, which were marked on the site.\nHere\u2019s what we found.

{"label": "true", "claim": "Barack Obama Says he eliminated an EPA rule that treated spilled milk like it was oil.", "evidence": "U.S. Rep. H. Morgan Griffith is milking his opposition to the Environmental Protection Agency for every last drop.\n\nThe Republican stressed his contempt for the agency throughout a heated campaign last fall in which Griffith unseated Democrat Rick Boucher, a 14-term congressman from coal-rich Southwest Virginia. In his victory speech, Griffith vowed to go to Washington and \"fight to rein in the EPA.\" Since taking office, he has fired out a barrage of anti-EPA statements.\n\nIn a February newsletter to constituents, Griffith claimed that new EPA rules treat milk spills the same way they treat oil spills. He titled the newsletter \"Crying over spilt milk.\"\n\n\"What do spilt milk and oil have in common?\" he wrote. \"Quite a bit, according to the EPA. In fact, a new ruling by the EPA would force dairy farmers to comply with the Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Program when dealing with spilt milk -- the same regulations oil and natural gas producers must follow. The EPA\u2019s reasoning is that milk contains \u2018a percentage of animal fats, which is a non-petroleum oil.\u2019 It appears spilt milk is just as threatening as an oil spill.\"\n\nWith visions of dairy farmers delicately dabbing milk off the wings of ducks, we looked into the claim.\n\nBeth Breeding, Griffith\u2019s press secretary, said her boss\u2019s information came from the EPA\u2019s website. So we went there.\n\nRight away, we found problems with Griffith\u2019s claim. The website says milk has been regulated under the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure program since 1973, when the Clean Water Act took effect. The law was passed by Congress the preceding year over the veto of Republican President Richard Nixon. So this is hardly a \"new ruling,\" as Griffith says. It has been in effect for 38 years.\n\nThe EPA site says \"since the SPCC rule became law in 1973, all kinds of oils including petroleum and edible oils (such as animal fats and vegetable oils) have been considered oils. This is because the SPCC rule gets its definition of \u2018oil\u2019 from the Clean Water Act, which was authored by Congress.\"\n\nThe website also notes the rule only applies to farms storing more than 1,320 gallons of oil or milk.\n\nSo what\u2019s new? According to the EPA, the only thing that comes close is a rule change it announced on Jan. 15, 2009. It goes in effect at the end of this month.\n\nThe simple purpose of the change is to exclude milk and dairy farms from the spill rules governing oil products. That\u2019s the exact opposite of what Griffith claims. Here\u2019s what the regulation says:\n\n\"EPA proposes to exempt milk containers and associated piping and appurtenances from the SPCC requirements provided they are constructed according to the current applicable 3-A Sanitary Standards, and are subject to the current applicable Grade \"A\" Pasteurized Milk Ordinance,\" or similar state laws.\n\nTranslated into plain English, the rule means milk storage will no longer have to meet the EPA\u2019s oil spill rules, provided storage tanks meet pasteurization laws. In Virginia it is illegal to sell \"raw,\" or unpasteurized, milk, so the state\u2019s dairy farmers should already be in compliance with the new standards. \u00a0\n\nRaw milk is now legal for sale in 25 states, although 15 of those states only allow sales directly from a farm. So conceivably raw milk producers -- which are almost exclusively small operations, according to a group that advocates for raw milk -- might still need to comply with the SPCC rules. But this would affect only a very small fraction of total U.S. milk.\n\nBaffled by how Griffith could have this claim so mixed up, we went back to his office for additional information. The second time around his press secretary pointed us to a Jan. 27 editorial\u00a0in The Wall Street Journal that makes virtually the same claim. The editorial wrongly said new EPA rules will apply to dairy farms and cover milk storage. The amended rule only applies to petroleum products -- gasoline, fuel oil and the like -- that are stored in large quantities on dairy farms. \u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s review our findings.\n\nGriffith claimed a \"new ruling by the EPA would force dairy farmers to comply\" with strict regulations for spills and leaks. He said the rules were the same as those enforced on oil and natural gas companies.\n\nIn fact, these regulations have been in place for 38 years and are not new at all. The \"new ruling\" from the EPA, announced in 2009 and taking effect in a few weeks, actually excludes milk from the spill standards, giving dairy farmers fewer regulations to meet. That\u2019s the exact opposite of what Griffith claims.\n\nSure, Griffith got some of his information from an inaccurate editorial in The Wall Street Journal. But a \u00a0congressman who is railing against a federal agency has the means to get his facts right.\n\nGriffith is dishing udder cow chips"}

First, Biden has been in office only three months while Trump served for four years. Second, a president has virtually nothing to do with the amount of equipment transferred through the program.

We know these things are happening and... it\u2019s just insane not to protect ourselves.\"\n\nWe wondered about al Qaeda having camps with the Mexican drug cartels.\n\nGohmert's basis\nTo our inquiry, Gohmert spokeswoman Kimberly Willingham noted a 2006 interim report and November 2012 follow-up report, \"A Line in the Sand: Countering Crime, Violence and Terror at the Southwest Border,\" prepared by the Republican staff of a subcommittee to the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee that was chaired by Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin.\n\nBoth reports say terrorists can cross the U.S.-Mexico border, though neither mentions al Qaeda camps in Mexico.\nMore recently, McCaul suggested that a foiled assassination plot involving an Iranian American resident of Round Rock, north of Austin, suggests a growing link between Mideast terrorist groups and organized crime in Mexico. Manssor Arbabsiar pleaded guilty in October 2012 to participating in a scheme to kill the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States after attempting to hire a hit man Arbabsiar believed to be a member of the Zetas Mexican drug cartel; the assassin was actually a paid Drug Enforcement Administration informant.\n\nMcCaul, who now chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, said in a December 2012 Austin American-Statesman interview that Iran and Mideast militant groups such as Hezbollah have long had money laundering and fundraising hubs across Latin America and the Texas-tied plot reflected \"the first time we have seen that financial relationship become potentially operational.\" McCaul also told the newspaper: \"It is not a real stretch of the imagination that these groups could work together operationally if they already have a financial relationship. Mexican cartels don't want to get into the terrorism business, and I think to a large extent that may be true, but I think the lesson of 9/11 was to connect the dots.\"\n\nMcCaul also said he would focus the committee on drawing attention to the threat of such emerging partnerships and keeping narco-terrorist operatives from crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe 2006 report overseen by McCaul, referencing a February 2003 report by the Library of Congress, says: \"Statements made by high-ranking Mexican officials prior to and following the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks indicate that one or more Islamic terrorist organizations has sought to establish a presence in Mexico.

John Culberson, R-Houston, asked Mueller if he was aware of individuals from countries with al Qaeda connections entering the United States using false identities, in particular changing Islamic surnames to Hispanic surnames. \"We\u2019ve had indications of that,\" Mueller replied, adding that he would have to check on instances of somebody from, say, a Middle Eastern country adopting an Hispanic name and attempting to enter the country.\n\n\"I'm not certain how many instances there might have been,\" Mueller testified. \"I can tell you that we are concerned, that Homeland Security is concerned about special interest aliens coming into the United States.

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Barack Obama \"A lot of the ideas in terms of the (health insurance) exchange, just being able to pool and improve the purchasing power of individuals in the insurance market, that originated from the Heritage Foundation.\"", "evidence": "EDITOR'S NOTE: An analysis of this comment by President Barack Obama was published on April 1, 2010. After it appeared, the Heritage Foundation's communications office contacted us to argue that our rating of Mostly True was too generous to the president. We did some additional reporting to review our ruling. Our second round of reporting -- primarily talking to conservative policy experts outside of Heritage -- solidified our initial conclusions. Below is the updated version of our story, which retains the rating of Mostly True, published April 26, 2010.Democrats like to parry Republican criticism of the recently passed health care law by talking about how it includes ideas that originated with conservatives. During an interview on NBC's Today show on March 30, 2010, President Barack Obama offered a specific example.Obama told host Matt Lauer that \"when you actually look at the bill itself, it incorporates all sorts of Republican ideas. I mean a lot of commentators have said this is sort of similar to the bill that Mitt Romney, the Republican governor and now presidential candidate, passed in Massachusetts. A lot of the ideas in terms of the exchange, just being able to pool and improve the purchasing power of individuals in the insurance market, that originated from the Heritage Foundation. ...\"We zeroed in on the notion that the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that is no fan of Obama's health care law as a whole, might have \"originated\" the idea of the health insurance exchange -- a virtual marketplace where individuals can purchase health insurance. Our interest only grew after we received an e-mail from Heritage president Ed Feulner that blasted Obama's claim.\"President Obama this morning cited the Heritage Foundation's research in an attempt to sell his health care package as a 'middle-of-the-road, centrist approach,'\" Feulner wrote. \"We take great exception to this misuse of our work and abuse of our name. This is but the latest act in a campaign to sell this big-government program as a moderate law that incorporates conservative ideas. Americans should not be fooled.\"Feulner went on to argue that \"the president knows full well \u2014 or he ought to learn before he speaks \u2014 that the exchanges we and most others support are very different from those in his package. True exchanges are simply a market mechanism to enable families to choose their health insurance. President Obama\u2019s exchanges, by contrast, are a vehicle to introduce sweeping regulation and federal standardization on health insurance.\"Heritage continued its campaign against Obama's claim in an April 19, 2010, op-ed column in the Washington Post. The director of Heritage's Center for Health Policy Studies, Robert Moffit, wrote that \"the version of the exchange we did develop couldn't be more different than that embodied in this law.\" He charged that \"the Obama health-care law 'builds' on the Heritage health reform model only in the sense that, say, a double-quarter-pounder with cheese 'builds' on the idea of a garden salad. Both have lettuce and tomato and may be called food, but the similarities end there.\"We see two related, but distinct, questions here. The first is whether Heritage did in fact \"originate\" the idea of health insurance exchanges. The second is whether the exchange prescribed by the new law mirrors the one that Heritage has supported.\u2022 Did Heritage originate the idea? Our research suggests that while Heritage has advocated for health insurance exchanges for many years, others did, too. Scholars credit Alain C. Enthoven -- an emeritus professor at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business who worked in the Defense Department during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations -- with popularizing the idea for an exchange as many as three decades ago.Still, there's little doubt that Heritage has been a consistent and eager promoter of the exchange idea, especially during the effort to design a new health care system for Massachusetts. That effort concluded with the Democratic legislature joining with the Republican governor, Romney, to implement a system that includes a health insurance exchange.On numerous occasions, Heritage scholars wrote approvingly of the exchange system in Massachusetts, known as the Connector. In a paper about the Massachusetts plan published on April 11, 2006, Edmund Haislmaier, a Heritage fellow in health care policy, wrote of the \"truly significant and transformative health system changes that the legislation would set in motion.\"Specifically, Haislmaier wrote that \"this concept of organizing a state's insurance markets around a central clearinghouse represents a dramatic departure from recent state health insurance reform proposals. States have spent the past 15 years trying to expand health care coverage to small-business employees, with virtually no positive results. The Massachusetts legislation represents a bipartisan commitment to move away from the policies that have largely failed to make progress in covering the uninsured for the past 15 years.\"In another paper, titled, \"The Rationale for a Statewide Health Insurance Exchange,\" and published on Oct. 5, 2006, Heritage scholar Robert Moffit wrote that \"the best option is a health insurance market exchange.\" Comparing it to a farmers' market or the used-car dealer CarMax, Moffit said the exchange \"would expand coverage and choice\" and would represent \"a revolutionary change in the health insurance market.\"Journalists seemed to give Heritage credit, as well. During 2006, columns and articles citing Heritage's role in promoting the health exchange idea ran in such publications as the Washington Post, the Dallas Morning News, the New Orleans Times-Picayune and the National Review.We feel the president is largely right on this point. The idea for exchanges may have \"originated\" outside Heritage, but in well over a decade leading up to the introduction of the president's health care plan, Heritage clearly took a high-profile role in touting it, culminating in the proposal enacted in Massachusetts. And given that, they can hardly be shocked that the president is noting the think tank's role in developing the overall concept (even if he did so in a self-serving way).\u2022 Is it the same idea? After Obama made his comment, we spoke to both Haislmaier and to Stuart Butler, Heritage's vice president for domestic policy. Both argued that the plan now enacted into law is fundamentally different in structure than the one Heritage advocated.\"What Obama and Capitol Hill did was to take a mainstream idea and push it toward a much more interventionist, regulatory model, as opposed to the original idea, which was more market-based,\" Butler said in an interview.To prevent Heritage scholars from moving the goalposts after the fact, we decided to analyze how similar the proposals are only by referring to policy stances that can be documented in briefing papers published prior to Obama's election. We found at least four papers that spoke directly to the health insurance exchange idea, and in these papers, we noticed several passages that advocated elements of an exchange that differ from how the bill was ultimately written.Here are some of those differences:-- Who can use the exchange? In a 2006 paper, Moffit wrote, \"Ideally, an exchange should be open to all state residents and all interested employers, regardless of the size of the firm, who want to arrange health insurance through the exchange.\"That's not the case with the exchanges in the new law -- at least not any time soon. When the exchanges go live in 2014, they will only be open to people already buying insurance on the individual market (that is, those buying insurance independent of their employer) and to employees of small businesses with up to 100 employees. A provision does allow employees of businesses with more than 100 employees to purchase coverage from the exchange, but not until 2017, and only if their state decides to allow it. (The exception is that employees who are paying too large a percentage of their income on their employer-based health insurance will be eligible in 2014.)-- How much federal regulation will there be? Heritage scholars have regularly argued that the key regulatory role for the exchanges should be handled by the states, rather than the federal government.In a 2007 paper, Butler wrote that \"each state would determine on its own such features as the infrastructure for handling premiums, as well as the regulations and requirements for accepting insurance plans into the exchange. The state also would be responsible for determining pooling, reinsurance, and risk adjustment arrangements and the degree to which firms would, if at all, be required to offer plans available through the exchange to their employees.\"It's true that the new health care law will create state-based exchanges. However, they will have to adhere to many federal requirements.For instance, the federal law requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to define an \"essential health benefits package\" (and update its details every year). This will become the minimum package offered on the exchanges. The law also limits plans sold on the exchange to charging differential premiums only based on age (in a 3-to-1 ratio), geography, family composition and tobacco use (on a 1.5-to-1 ratio). And health plans on the exchange will have to abide by an assortment of other rules governing marketing requirements, provider networks and standards for presenting information to consumers.-- How portable will insurance be? In a 2007 paper published by Heritage, researcher Connie Marshner argued that health insurance exchanges would promote portability of health insurance. \"When individuals are able to purchase health insurance for themselves in an (exchange) marketplace, the insurance belongs to them,\" Marshner wrote. \"Even if they change jobs, move, or quit working and retire, they own the policy and can keep the same health insurance if they so choose.\"That should be the case for many people on the health care law's exchange, especially those who bought their insurance individually, as long as states don't erect high barriers that bar people from moving from one state's exchange to another. But full portability will be unlikely for those who purchased insurance on the exchange with the help of their employer. While the exchange should make it easier for those switching jobs to find new insurance, there will most likely be a disruption when that employee switches companies -- and whenever there's a disruption in coverage, there's a likelihood that their plan will have to change to one degree or another.So where does this leave us?Edwin Park, a senior fellow with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, sees significant similarities in approach despite the differences outlined above. Park said the differences involved \"rules of the road within the exchange, rather than fundamental differences in the underlying concept or structure.\"Henry Aaron, a fellow with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, called the new health care law \"a close relative\" of Heritage's plan -- \"not identical to be sure, but a sibling or at least a first cousin. The essence is that you have a government or nonprofit entity that regulates the sale of insurance to individuals or businesses in order to standardize offerings and to control selling methods in order to produce real, head-to-head competition and to provide customers information in forms they can readily understand. ... Yes, they are all different; but they are all of the same family. \"We also solicited the views of conservative policy experts beyond Heritage.One -- Tevi Troy, a visiting senior fellow at the Hudson Institute -- thought Heritage had a legitimate gripe. \"In the policy world, there is often a vast gulf between theoretical ideas and policies as implemented, and this case is no exception,\" Troy said. \"While Heritage had been a leading advocate for health insurance exchanges, the law as written creates something so different from what Heritage sought that I understand why they want to remove their name from the list of proponents.\"However, we heard from nine people affiliated with conservative policy organizations other than Heritage who thought that the president's statement was reasonably accurate.Seven of them declined to publicly express their differences with Heritage for fear of making waves within the tight-knit conservative policy world. But two did allow their names to be used. One was Dan Miller, executive vice president of the Chicago-based Heartland Institute, who acknowledged that Obama's statement was so carefully worded that the president \"was able to exploit\" the issue \"for his own ends.\"The other was Daniel McCarthy, senior editor of the American Conservative magazine who has written recently about the conservative origins of the president's health care plan.\"Every think tank on the left and right knows that its recommendations will undergo some deformation before they make their way into law, if they ever do,\" McCarthy told PolitiFact. \"Heritage might prefer state insurance exchanges with greater individual choice, including for workers already covered by their employers. But I don't imagine Ed Feulner would be complaining at all if a Republican president or a Republican Congress had passed a plan that deviated from the Heritage blueprint to the same degree that Obama's bill has. While it's not true that 'lots of' the specifics in the Obama plan were dreamed up by Heritage, the overall approach is similar to policies Heritage has long championed, including the individual mandate as well as the insurance exchanges. This is only controversial because the wrong party happened to pass the law, and it's poison for any conservative to be identified with it.\"We agree with Heritage that the differences between its original vision and the version enacted into law are not trivial, and are enough to undercut the president's effort to secure a Heritage Foundation seal of approval for his bill. But the president helped his case by wording his statement with extreme care. Intentionally or not, he gave himself subtle linguistic running room by saying that \"a lot of the ideas\" for the exchange came from Heritage, including the concept of \"just being able to pool and improve the purchasing power of individuals in the insurance market.\" Even if not all of the ideas in the two plans are identical, we feel that it was fair of him to say that \"a lot of the ideas\" are in common, including the notion of pooling"}

The council instead came up with the money by cutting other spending and upgrading revenues forecasts.\nThe next day, Stoney didn\u2019t rule out seeking a tax increase again next year. \"I\u2019m always going to swing for the fences,\" he said at a May 14 news conference. \"I\u2019ll do whatever is necessary for our kids.\"\nDuring a radio interview on WRVA that day, Stoney said Richmond is one of the few Virginia cities that has a lower real estate tax rate today than it did prior to the Great Recession - which started in December 2007.\n\"Richmond was one of the only cities in the state that did not roll back their real estate tax to those pre-recession rates,\" he said.\nStoney made similar comments throughout the spring while trying to convince Richmonders they are overdue for a tax increase if they want to improve their schools in performance and physical structure. We wondered if he\u2019s right that Richmond is among the very few cities that hasn\u2019t raised its real estate tax rate to pre-recession levels.\nWe turned to annual reports on tax rates in Virginia localities published by the state Department of Taxation. We charted the real estate tax rate enacted by each of 38 Virginia cities every year since 2006 - the last full year before the recession. The Great Recession began in the U.S. in December 2007 and lasted until June 2009, although its after effects lingered for several more years.\nRichmond\u2019s real estate tax rate was $1.23 per $100 in assessed value in 2006. The next year, it dropped to $1.20 and has remained unchanged.\nOnly five Virginia cities, five join Richmond in having a lower tax rate today than in 2006:\u00a0Chesapeake; Hopewell; Martinsville; Norfolk and Portsmouth. Three cities have the same rate today they had in 2006: Lynchburg, Petersburg and Salem.\nThe average rate for all cities was 96 cents in 2006 and $1.08 in the first half of 2019. That\u2019s an average increase of 12 cents per $100 of assessed value.\nIt could be argued that 2007 is a a more precise starting point because the recession didn\u2019t begin until that December and all cities had their rates enacted by mid year. Anticipating a healthy economy, 16 cities cut taxes that year.\n\n"}

It\u2019s clear, though, that they want to do it in a way that is consistent with other states and S.37 just isn\u2019t.", "evidence": "A multi-year debate over Vermonters\u2019 right to medical monitoring, supported by environmental advocates and loathed by industry, bubbled to the surface during a recent House debate.\nUnder tort law, people who sue traditionally need to show proof of an injury to be awarded damages. Starting in the 1980s, some courts in the U.S. began awarding plaintiffs exposed to hazardous substances payment for diagnostic tests and other procedures for early detection of diseases they face an increased risk of developing due to exposure. Those cases are referred to as \"medical monitoring\" claims.\u00a0\nBennington\u2019s two senators, Democrats Dick Sears and Brian Campion, had sponsored a bill, S.37, in response to the contamination of private wells\u00a0around Bennington with PFOA from the ChemFab plant in town.\u00a0\nUnder S.37, Vermonters without a disease would have a \"cause of action\" to sue a company that exposed them to toxic substances through wrongful conduct for medical monitoring costs. Before awarding medical monitoring, a court would have to find that the exposure increases the risk of developing a disease. A medical expert would also have to deem that diagnostic testing beyond normal medical checkups to be reasonably necessary.\nOnly businesses of 10 or more employees \u2014 or of 500 or more employees at multiple facilities \u2014 in the mining, manufacturing, transportation and utility sectors could be sued for medical monitoring costs under S.37.\u00a0\nThe state discovered the Bennington area contamination in 2016. The Department of Health offered Bennington area residents testing for PFOA levels\u00a0in their blood.\u00a0\nPFOA is one of the most toxic chemicals of the man-made PFAS chemicals. PFAS, which stands for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, do not break down in the environment and are used in a wide array of manufactured products, from rain jackets to cookware to firefighting foam. Scientists now know that exposure to certain PFAS chemicals can lead to cancer, thyroid disease, immune system damages, developmental problems in children and low birth weight.Proponents of the medical monitoring bill argue that companies that release toxic pollutants -- not the state or exposed individuals -- should have to pay for that medical testing.\u00a0\nA similar proposal was vetoed last year by Gov. Phil Scott, who said it created an \"unprecedented\" level of liability\u00a0for Vermont businesses.\nDuring a House floor debate on the bill last week, Rep. Scott Beck, R-St. Johnsbury, introduced an amendment to S.37\u00a0favored by industry representatives that sets more stringent criteria for people in an exposed area to receive medical monitoring.\u00a0\nMultiple lawmakers rose to speak in favor of the amendment. Rep. Heidi Scheuermann, R-Stowe, said representatives from the manufacturing industry \"came to Montpelier this year\" with the intent of supporting medical monitoring legislation.\u00a0\n\"They understand the importance (of medical monitoring),\" she said on the House floor last Thursday, referring to industry. \"It\u2019s clear, though, that they want to do it in a way that is consistent with other states and S.37 just isn\u2019t.\"\nSen. Brian Collamore, R-Rutland, and Sen. Bobby Starr, D-Essex-Orleans, echoed similar concerns during Senate floor debate on the bill this week.\u00a0\nThe bill passed both the House and the Senate, but is unlikely to get the governor's signature.\nSo we were wondering, if S.37 becomes law, would Vermont be an outlier compared to the rest of the country?\nIn an interview Wednesday, Scheuermann said that her statement came from concerns expressed by industry representatives and lobbyists. In particular, they felt the so-called \"test\" for medical monitoring in S.37 was too lenient and would impact their ability to obtain insurance, she said.\u00a0\n\"GlobalFoundries testified, the Vermont Chamber of Commerce testified, (Associated Industries of Vermont) testified, all pointing out the specifics of how it is out of line with other states and what that impact could be to manufacturers in our state and their ability to obtain liability insurance,\" she said.\u00a0\nScheuermann also directed VTDigger to a state-by-state comparison\u00a0of medical monitoring from Jill Rickard, director of policy at the state Department of Financial Regulation.\u00a0\nIn Rickard\u2019s comparison, five of the six states and territories referenced \u2014 Guam, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Florida \u2014 require plaintiffs demonstrate either significant exposure to a toxic substance or exposure greater than background levels. Courts in Guam, Florida and Pennsylvania all say that the plaintiff must have a \"significantly\" increased risk of contracting a \"serious\" latent disease.\nBeck\u2019s amendment would have required exposure to a toxic substance be \"significant.\" It also would have changed \"greater risk of contracting a latent disease\" to a \"significantly increased risk of contracting a serious latent disease.\"\nThe argument between industry representative and environmental advocates on the latest version centers on whether or not to include those adjectives in the medical monitoring test in S.37.\u00a0\n\n"}

So we took our own look.\n\nThe health care law took effect in 2010, and taxes began then to support the measure. Key \u00a0parts of the bill don\u2019t kick in until 2014.\n\nIn an item about Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, PolitiFact National noted that the 10-year aspect of the claim was correct.\n\nThe item read, in part:: \"The CBO said this about the health care law back in 2010: It lowers the deficit, by about $124 billion over 10 years. And in 2011, when Republicans offered a bill to repeal the health care law, the CBO said that increased the deficit, by about $210 billion over 10 years.\"\n\nThat estimate was updated in July 2012, when the CBO said the law would cost $84 billion less than it had previously predicted.\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2011, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virg., made virtually the same claim as Hovde, saying the law \"offset 6 years of benefits with 10 years of tax increases\" and it was Half True.\n\nPolitiFact Virginia noted: \"Cantor\u2019s argument that the \u2018benefits\u2019 don\u2019t kick in until 2014 is true if you\u2019re looking at the biggest provisions of the law. But many other, smaller provisions to boost coverage have already taken effect.\" Those include small business tax credits, coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, assistance for early retirees and coverage for dependents until they\u2019re age 26. Also, not all of the taxes kicked in immediately.\n\nOn March 1, 2011, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli said the law has \"six years of costs against 10 years of tax revenue.\" PolitiFact Virginia also rated Cuccinelli\u2019s claim Half True.\n\n\"The bill is is a bit front-loaded. About 10 percent of the taxes for health care reform will be levied in the first four years to pay for an estimated 1 percent of cost,\" it wrote. \"But Cuccinelli is flat wrong to say health care reform offers no benefits before 2014.\"\n\nSo, yes, the taxing began in 2010, and key parts of it don\u2019t kick in until 2014.

Sarah Palin has been making waves in the blogosphere with a recent op-ed on cap-and-trade.\n\u00a0\nHer critics say Palin's July 14, 2009, piece in the  Washington Post  gets it all wrong. It \"displays an ignorance for the subject so profound it's almost gutsy,\" Conor Clarke wrote in the  Atlantic  .\u00a0 Keith Olberman said on  Countdown  that she uses \"the sky-is-falling tactics.\"\n\u00a0\nWe've explored other aspects of the cap-and-trade bill before, including  how much it would cost  lower-income consumers (Palin says it would hit them hardest, but the independent Congressional Budget Office predicts it would actually put money in the pockets of the poorest), as well as  how much of an impact  the bill would really have on climate.\n\u00a0\nToday, we're tackling this claim from Palin's op-ed: \"Job losses are so certain under this new cap-and-tax plan that it includes a provision accommodating newly unemployed workers from the resulting dried-up energy sector, to the tune of $4.2 billion over eight years. So much for creating jobs.\"\n\u00a0\nBefore we dig into Palin's statement, here's a quick summary of how the cap-and-trade bill, authored by Reps. Henry Waxman of California and Edward Markey of Massachusetts, would work. The bill aims to slow climate change by lowering carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. To do that, the bill would cap yearly carbon emissions, and to comply, companies will have to either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits to continue polluting. Initially, the government's permits for polluters would be given out for free. But eventually, companies would have to buy those permits from the government.\n\nPalin and other Republicans say they are concerned that the transition will be costly to industry \u2014 particularly companies in the energy sector \u2014 and that workers will lose their jobs as a result.\n\u00a0\nThe authors of the bill are also concerned \u2014 so much so that they included the program Palin refers to. Should workers lose their jobs, they would get 156 weeks of benefits, including 70 percent of their average weekly wage, help paying for health insurance, job training and employment search assistance.\n\u00a0\nSo, Palin is correct that the bill has a program for displaced workers.\n\nFunding for the program would come from selling those pollution allowances we mentioned earlier.\n\nSupporters of cap-and-trade argue that Palin's statement is misleading because she makes it seem like, overall, the bill is killing jobs. They say she neglects to point out that it will add thousands of jobs in industries that will grow because of the dramatic policy change. Bracken Hendricks, a senior fellow with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, recently predicted the bill would create 1.7 million new jobs. The program Palin's talking about will also help train those workers to participate in the emerging industry.\n\u00a0\n\"In an economic shift from pollution to clean energy, some sectors will see impacts,\" he said. \"But this policy isn't about job loss, it's about anticipated growth. ... The expectation is that there will be a net job creation.\"\n\u00a0\nSo, back to Palin's claim. She's correct that there is a program in the bill that would help displaced workers, but she paints a narrow view of how the bill will affect employment. Yes, some workers will be displaced and need to be retrained, but some experts are projecting growth and new jobs in industries that benefit from the new policy"}

The payments were smaller because the first payments applied to less than a full year.\n\nBut as a result of the legal dispute, the Devils paid no rent in years two through four of the lease agreement, according to the arbitrators\u2019 decision. The team was asserting its right to withhold rent under a clause in the lease agreement, the decision states.\n\nArena spokesman Robert Sommer argued that both the city and the team were withholding payments to each other.\n\n\"They withheld money as well,\" Sommer told us. \"No payments were being made in either direction.\"\n\nAmong other rent payments, the arbitrators determined that the Devils owe $1.5 million for the sports and job training programs for those three years. The hockey team also owes an additional $2,738 for the first year, according to the decision.\n\nBut instead of getting money back, city officials end up owing money to the Devils, because of parking revenues and other issues addressed in the arbitrators\u2019 decision.\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn an interview on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, Booker claimed Vanderbeek \"froze all those monies during the toughest years in \u201808-\u201909\" and \"refused to give the charitable dollars that he was required to give by the contract.\"\n\nAccording to the arbitrators\u2019 decision, the Devils paid $346,576 toward youth and community sports programs and job training programs for the first year of the contract.

If Darragh was an American, then under American law, Cruz was an American at birth.\nWe were curious about Trump\u2019s claim\u00a0in a Jan. 5, 2016, interview\u00a0with the Post -- offered by the candidate without documentary evidence -- that Cruz has had more than one passport, implying the\u00a0Houston lawyer spent some time trying to pass as a citizen of either Canada or the U.S.\nPrior to a Trump rally in Lowell, Mass., the Post asked Trump about Cruz\u2019s Canadian roots.\nTrump replied: \"Republicans are going to have to ask themselves the question: \u2018Do we want a candidate who could be tied up in court for two years?\u2019 That\u2019d be a big problem.

{"label": "false", "claim": "Tennessee Democratic Party The \"Health Care Compact bill would end Medicare's guaranteed benefit for Tennessee's Medicare recipients and shift management of the federal health care plan to the state's TennCare program.\"", "evidence": "Legislation clearing the way for Tennessee to participate in a \"Health Care Compact\"was supported by Republicans on a virtually unanimous basis during the last legislative session. Now, the Tennessee Democratic Party is trying to turn that support into a liability during the campaign season.\n\nIn news releases, the party is targeting virtually every incumbent Republican state legislator who faces a Democratic challenger in this fall's election. With minor variations depending on the targeted incumbent, the releases sent to media in East Tennessee districts carried very similar wording. As a sample, the following is from the release that went out in House District 33 in which state Rep. John Ragan, R-Oak Ridge, is being challenged by Democratic former Rep. Jim Hackworth:\n\n\"Earlier this year, Rep. John Ragan co-sponsored a measure that would eliminate Medicare's guaranteed benefit for 800,000 Tennessee seniors and force them into TennCare.\"\n\nOther releases simply change the name, using the same wording. Ragan was one of 44 co-sponsors in the House of the bill, which fell four votes short of the 50-vote majority needed for House passage in the last hour of the 2012 legislative session \u2013 when several Republicans had left the House chamber \u2013 after passing the Senate 22-9. All \"no\" votes came from Democrats in both chambers.\n\nDuring the session, the bill (SB326) was hotly debated by lawmakers with considerable back-and-forth between Republicans and Democrats over what it would \u2013 or would not \u2013 do. The Democratic party's news release somewhat echoes comments of some Democratic legislators during that debate.\n\n\"What a lie!\" said Sen. Mae Beavers, R-Mount Juliet, who was lead Senate sponsor of the measure, when shown a copy of the Ragan release.\n\n\"It is obvious my opposition is spreading misinformation to confuse voters into supporting them because their platform is so unpopular in Tennessee,\" said Ragan in an emailed statement.\n\nSo who's right?\n\nThe bill basically envisions state government taking over most major health care programs now operated by the federal government, including Medicare. The idea is for states to join together in a Health Care Compact and petition Congress to give up federal control, sending states all of the federal funding being used to cover program costs \u2013 about $11.5 billion in Tennessee's case, according to the Legislature's Fiscal Review Committee staff.\n\nSix states have already approved similar health care compact legislation, according to the Health Care Compact Alliance website. They include Georgia, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and Utah. Indiana also passed a compact bill, but amended it to say that Medicare would remain with the federal government.\n\nIn Tennessee, Beavers said the bill was inspired by passage of the Affordable Health Care Act, now widely known as Obamacare, and its impact on state costs for overseeing Medicaid, which provides health care coverage for low-income persons as opposed to Medicare, which covers those over age 65 regardless of income. Beavers said, in fact, that if Obamacare winds up being repealed, she would see no need for a Health Care Compact \u2013 though, as things stand now, the quest for passage will be renewed in January.\n\nIn Tennessee, the state already operates the Medicaid program through the TennCare program. The federal government providing about two-thirds of the funding with the state covering the rest. Medicare is 100 percent federally funded.\n\nThe Tennessee Health Care Compact legislation, as filed in the past legislative session, is rather vague on what creation of a compact would mean.\n\n\"The legislatures of the member states have the primary responsibility to regulate health care in their respective states,\" says one provision of the bill.\n\nAs to how the legislatures in general, or the Tennessee legislature in particular, would regulate health care \u2013 including the guaranteed Medicare coverage for persons over age 65 \u2013 it is utterly silent. Beavers says that Medicare could well be left with the federal government, if the Legislature so decides.\n\nIt seems to us, then, that any declaration of what the bill would mean for Medicare enrollees \u2013 or most anyone else -- is speculation, not fact.\n\nThe Democrats' declaration is founded, first, on the expectation that Congress would go along with turning Medicare over to states that want to run the show \u2013 along with the money to pay for it. That is surely a debatable proposition; perhaps even doubtful.\n\nAnd, if the feds did turn everything over to the states, they could attach conditions \u2013 say, for example, that current coverage of seniors must be maintained \u2013 though legislative sponsors envision the money coming with no strings attached.\n\nNext, assuming Congress goes along with the idea and the money is sent to Tennessee without conditions, then the Legislature has to make decisions. That means introduction of more bills, more debate and a chance for citizen input before decisions are made. It's possible that citizens could become alarmed, once they are aware of the possibilities, and legislators would listen.\nNow, the bill is so open-ended that the Legislature could, granted congressional approval, proceed to change Medicare eligibility rules in all sorts of ways.\n\nInvited to defend the assertion made in the news release, Brandon Puttbrese, communications director for the Tennessee Democratic party, provided a lengthy response. Here's part of it:\n\"Were it (the compact) to take effect, Tennessee would receive a block grant from the federal government and also sacrifice hundreds of millions in federal funds by 2014 and billions by 2022 because funding for the compact is not designed to keep pace with medical inflation.\n\n\"So where do we make up that funding for Tennessee's seniors -- now including baby boomers -- who are going to depend on this care? New taxes? Repealing their millionaire and billionaire tax breaks?\n\n\"With no guarantees that the federal funding formulas will keep up with medical inflation or changing age structures in the population, Republicans in states like Tennessee are more likely to turn to the time-tested tools for cutting costs.\n\n\"Those are: changing eligibility standards so that fewer people are enrolled; reducing services provided shifting costs onto beneficiaries and cutting payments to providers.\"\n\nPuttbrese also provided links to testimony in Texas related to passage of a Health Care Compact bill. Part of the testimony involves whether the federal funding could run short in future years in a Medicare takeover. The Legislature's Fiscal Review staff basically assumes it would not under the Tennessee version of the bill, which includes a formula for changes in federal money based on inflation and population.\n\nSetting aside that tangential discussion, we note that Puttbrese is making some assumptions and raising hypothetical questions. Which involves, again, speculation and not fact.\n\nFurther, Puttbrese says that the party has changed the wording on the releasessince our initial inquiry on that wording. The initial releases targeted East Tennessee Republicans; the change was made as releases began targeting Middle Tennessee Republicans, Puttbrese said.\nHere's the new wording in a release targeting Rep. Jim Gotto, R-Nashville, that replaces the language in the earlier version above targeting Rep. John Ragan:\n\n\"Earlier this year, Tennessee Republicans, including state Rep. Jim Gotto, co-sponsored the Health Care Compact bill, an extreme measure that endangers the health benefits of 800,000 Tennessee seniors enrolled in Medicare and shifts management of their healthcare plans to TennCare.\"\n\nThe key change is to substitute \"would eliminate Medicare's guaranteed benefit for 800,000 Tennessee seniors\" to \"endangers the health benefits of 800,000 Tennessee seniors.\"\n\nWith the revision, we think the Democrats have a reasonable assertion, insofar as political endeavors go. If the federal government turned Medicare over to the state Legislature's oversight with no strings attached, as conceivable under the bill, we're not ready to predict what would happen. But the possibility of endangered beneficiaries would be there.\n\nIndeed, if the original release language was changed to use the word 'could' instead of 'would,' the party would have a more defensible statement.\n\nBut we set out to evaluate the original release, not the revised version and not to engage in semantic speculation over what difference the change of a word might have made"}
{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Richard Durbin Says President Barack Obama\u2019s nominees met a standard of 60 votes, \"a standard that was met by Elena Kagan as well as Sonia Sotomayor, President Obama's choices.\"", "evidence": "The morning after President Donald Trump announced Judge Neil Gorsuch as his nominee to fill the vacant seat on the U.S. Supreme Court, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., appeared on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe to share his thoughts about the president\u2019s pick.\nDurbin, the Democratic whip and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in the interview he believes Gorsuch should have a hearing, but that the nominee also should meet the required voting standard.\n\n\"(Gorsuch) should have a hearing and he should meet the voting standard that Supreme Court nominees are held to of 60 votes. A standard that was met by Elena Kagan as well as Sonia Sotomayor, President Obama's choices,\" Durbin told the show\u2019s hosts.\nWith Senate Republicans considering the so-called \"nuclear option\" to lower the vote threshold needed to confirm Gorsuch, we decided to double-check Durbin\u2019s declaration.\nDurbin has a point, but he does oversimplifies the process for Senate votes on Supreme Court nominees. Notably, a formal confirmation vote does not require 60 votes.\nVoting standard?\nOf the nearly 4,000 government positions Trump must fill, 1,212 require a Senate confirmation.\nThat includes all Cabinet-level posts as well as hundreds of other senior positions and agency heads.\nHere\u2019s how the confirmation process will work for Gorsuch: He will testify in a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. If the committee refers his nomination to the full Senate (a likely outcome due to the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee), a vote by the full Senate needs to be taken. The Senate majority leader moves to take the Senate into an executive session, the setting in which nominees are confirmed, according to Worth Hester, the assistant director of the Georgetown Government Affairs Institute.\nThen, the Senate majority leader needs to bring a nominee to a vote by the full Senate. In Gorsuch\u2019s case, barring any outstanding circumstances, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will either get unanimous consent, a process by which every senator agrees to schedule a vote on a nominee. However, if unanimous consent cannot be reached, and if at least one senator filibusters, Sen. McConnell would need to invoke cloture.\nA \"cloture vote,\" agrees to place a time limit on the consideration of a nominee. A successful cloture requires 60 votes. After the cloture vote, Senate rules allow for 30 additional hours of debate, and then a final confirmation vote occurs, according to Sarah Binder, political scientist at George Washington University and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\nThis confirmation process for some positions became less burdensome thanks to a rule change on Nov. 21, 2013.\nWith the Senate\u2019s Republican minority blocking President Barack Obama\u2019s nominees for executive branch positions and, in particular, appeals court judges, then-Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., triggered the so-called nuclear option by a successful 52-48 vote, eliminating the 60-vote threshold needed to confirm most nominations, and with it, the threat of a filibuster.\n\n"}

Kevin Cramer sparred over the fairness of who will get to participate in one of the most hotly contested elections.\nThe moderator asked the two candidates whether they believe the Supreme Court made the right decision in upholding North Dakota\u2019s new voter ID law on Oct. 9. The law requires residents show ID with a current street address.\nA federal district court in North Dakota originally ruled to allow voters to show either a current\u00a0street or mailing address, like a PO box. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th circuit put that order on hold. The Supreme Court allowed the hold to stay in place. The case continues before the 8th Circuit.\nHeitkamp called attention to the law\u2019s disproportionately negative effect on Native American voters, many of whom don\u2019t have a street address and use a PO box instead.\n\"Our district court judge did the right thing and ruled that this was an inappropriate infringement on voting rights,\" Heitkamp said. \"I hope Native American veterans get an opportunity to vote because they put on a uniform and earned that opportunity.\"\n\"And they do get to vote, Senator,\" Cramer replied. \"That\u2019s the point. The standard for voting in North Dakota is the easiest of anywhere in the country. We are the only state that does not have voter registration.\"\nCramer is right that there\u2019s no voter registration, unlike any other state. But that doesn\u2019t make North Dakota the easiest state to vote in.\n\"North Dakota does pretty well and did pretty well from 1996 to 2008,\" said Michael Pomante, a political science professor at Jacksonville University. \"After 2008, that\u2019s no longer the case.\"\nPomante published a paper in September that ranks the 50 states according to the ease of 33 voting laws alongside two other researchers. They looked at registration requirements, wait times, mail-in ballot options and the strictness of voter ID laws, among other indicators.\nNorth Dakota used to be No. 1 because of its lack of voter registration. It ranked fourth in 2016, and Pomante expects it to drop several spots next year because of the new ID law Heitkamp mentioned. He expects other states to jump ahead thanks to automatic registration options when people are in contact with a state agency.\nIn 2016, the researchers determined that voting was easiest in Oregon, where voters are registered automatically and are mailed ballots weeks in advance of election day. Colorado and California came in at second and third, respectively.\n\"Registering to vote is the biggest determinant of whether or not someone can vote,\" Pomante said. \"So having no registration means you can just show up, and automatic means same thing. Basically the burden of registering to vote is no longer on the individual citizen.\"\n\n"}

Luther Olsen, his recall opponent, supported the sale of state-owned power plants \"not to the highest bidder, but to the biggest donors\" with no oversight.", "evidence": "Two Democrats working to knock off Wisconsin state senators in recall elections on Aug. 9, 2011, are reviving the short-lived controversy over Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s plan to sell off state-owned power plants.\n\nIn a strongly worded TV ad, Nancy Nusbaum and Fred Clark pair up to accuse their respective opponents, GOP senators Robert Cowles and Luther Olsen, of an abuse of power -- or at least an attempted one.\n\n\"Power. We gave it to senators Robert Cowles and Luther Olsen, then they tried to sell it,\" intones a narrator in the ad. \"Supporting the sale of Wisconsin\u2019s power plants, not to the highest bidder, but to the biggest donors. No bid contracts, no oversight, an invitation for corruption.\"\n\nTwo contested races, a high-stakes election and a provocative claim -- in other words, right up our alley.\n\nBecause the case against each is slightly different, we are looking at them in separate items. You can find the Nusbaum vs. Cowles analysis here.\n\nSo, did Olsen support selling the plants to the biggest campaign donors with no oversight?\n\nWalker\u2019s budget-repair bill, proposed in February 2011, would have allowed a no-bid sale of up to 37 heating and cooling plants, primarily at University of Wisconsin campuses. Walker said the sale would avoid costly plant upgrades at taxpayer expense.\n\nThe clause immediately triggered accusations that Walker was setting up a deal to benefit Koch Industries, which the Journal Sentinel reported was the largest corporate contributor to Walker in the 2010 campaign. At the time, Koch Industries denied any interest in the plants.\n\nThe power-plant controversy all but died out amid the massive protests over Walker\u2019s move to curtail collective bargaining for most public employees.\n\nIn fact, the power-plant sale provision was removed from the bill in the chaotic endgame that allowed Republican senators to approve the collective-bargaining changes without the Democrats who had fled to Illinois to block a quorum.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the three components of the claim:\n\n Supporting the no-bid sale approach.\n\nThe state Democratic Party, responding on behalf of the two Democrats, pointed us to a vote by Olsen.\n\nAs a member of the Legislature\u2019s Joint Finance Committee, Olsen voted to approve an amended version of Walker\u2019s budget -- at a time when the bill still included the no-bid sale language.\n\nOlsen told us the potential lack of transparency concerned him, but that the power plants were unique facilities.\n\nIn 2005, Republicans also pushed for sale of the plants, trying to insert it into the budget. When the matter came up at Joint Finance. Olsen opposed adding it into the budget. (It ultimately went in over his objections but was vetoed by then-Gov. Jim Doyle).\n\nSupporting a sale of the plants to the \"biggest donors.\"\n\nThis is an apparent reference to campaign donors.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Koch or Wisconsin utilities who have given to Walker and Republicans could have emerged as buyers and purchased state plants. And they may have had an easier road without a formal bidding process.\n\nBut contrary to the dramatic accusation in the TV ad, the language in the bill didn\u2019t select any winners, much less winners who are fat-cat campaign contributors. The bill would have authorized the no-bid sale, but who the ultimate bidders -- or buyers -- would be in that scenario can\u2019t be known.\n\nSupporting the sale without any oversight.\n\nThe original bill drew criticism in part because it went beyond the 2005 attempt by Republicans to sell the plants. That earlier effort would have required bids, and called for Public Service Commission review on whether the sale is in the public interest.\n\nThe 2011 plan submitted by Walker did not include those steps.\n\nBut amid the criticism, the Legislature\u2019s Joint Finance Committee beefed up the oversight, requiring that any proposed sale forwarded by Walker\u2019s administration first go through the committee.\n\nOlsen voted for the additional oversight of the selection process.\n\nLet\u2019s review.\n\nDemocratic challenger Clark race accused Olsen of \"supporting the sale of Wisconsin\u2019s power plants, not to the highest bidder, but to the biggest donors. No bid contracts, no oversight, an invitation for corruption.\"\n\nFor Olsen, they cite only his committee vote.\n\nSome viewers -- perhaps most -- may assume from the ad that Olsen actually voted to sell the plants to a big campaign donor. The ad is misleading on that score alone. It would have allowed a no-bid process for the sale, but did not designate any specific buyer.\n\nThe ad\u2019s claim starts off OK by saying Olsen supported a no-bid approach. So there\u2019s an element of truth in the claim.\n\nBut some critical facts are ignored and evidence missing on part of the claim. Olsen backed legislative oversight of any sale, and there is no evidence that his vote was \"supporting\" a sale to the flashiest campaign donor"}

{"label": "false", "claim": "Ted Strickland About $4.89 billion in one-time money was used to balance the current state general revenue fund budget.", "evidence": "A long-running debate at the Statehouse has focused on the role that federal stimulus money played in former Gov. Ted Strickland\u2019s last state budget.\n\nFrom the day it was first introduced in February 2009, Republicans ripped Strickland\u2019s budget for relying on billions in federal stimulus dollars to help Ohio shore its state budget.\n\nThe now-absent federal stimulus dollars are the chief reason, Republicans have long argued, that they are now forced to make gouging cuts in education and local government funds to keep the next state budget in balance.\n\nHouse Democrats tried to turn the tables on that GOP argument during the seven-hour-long floor debate May 5, 2011, over the next state budget. They did so by noting that the state budget proposed by Republican Gov. John Kasich actually had more federal dollars in it then the one crafted by Democrats in 2009.\n\n\"I think it\u2019s important to note that even accounting for the federal stimulus dollars, there are more federal dollars in this biennial than there are federal dollars in the previous biennial budget,\" said Rep. Jay Goyal, a Mansfield lawmaker. \"I think that\u2019s an important fact to note.\"\n\nHouse Republicans immediately jumped on Goyal\u2019s statement with Rep. Ron Amstutz, a Wooster Republican, even invoking PolitiFact Ohio saying that should be awarded a Pants on Fire rating.\n\nDoes it?\n\nHouse Democratic Caucus spokeswoman Melissa Fazekas pulled some numbers from Strickland\u2019s current state budget, which runs through June 30, as well as Kasich\u2019s proposal for the next state budget.\n\nThe House Democratic numbers \u2014 taken from the state budget summary put together by the Office of Budget and Management under Kasich \u2014 show a total of $6.9 billion in federal dollars in 2010 and $8.2 billion in 2011 deposited into Ohio\u2019s general revenue fund. That\u2019s a total of $15.1 billion in federal dollars over both years of Strickland\u2019s budget.\n\nMeanwhile, Kasich\u2019s proposed budget for 2012-13 relies on $7.55 billion in 2012 and $8.49 billion in 2013. That\u2019s a total of $16.04 billion \u2014 or about $940 million more than what Strickland had to used in his budget, according to the chart Democrats relied upon.\n\nSo Goyal\u2019s right? Not so fast.\n\nThe chart on which House Democrats relied only compares the federal dollars in the state\u2019s general revenue fund in both budgets.\n\nAnd while that\u2019s the usual place where federal dollars end up in state budgets, Strickland\u2019s budget director Pari Sabety moved portions of the state\u2019s Medicaid program \"off-budget\" in 2009, so not all the federal money went into the state\u2019s general revenue fund.\n\nIn fact, a state budget document titled \"estimated one-time revenue source\" prepared by the Strickland administration has a notation marked \"footnote D\" concerning a pot of federal money known as enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, or FMAP. Basically, federal officials decided to reimburse states at a higher rate for Medicare and Medicaid costs than they normally do\u2014picking up 73 cents of every dollar spent on medical care instead of the usual rate of 64 cents.\n\nThe footnote explains that only a small portion of that enhanced FMAP money was funneled into the state\u2019s general revenue fund. \"Under budget framework, an additional $1.3 billion in FY 2010 and $590 million in FY 2011 is deposited into non-GRF funds,\" the footnote says.\n\nPut simply, there was nearly $1.9 billion in federal dollars in the last budget beyond what was in Ohio\u2019s general revenue fund.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not all. That\u2019s because federal officials added even more money to the enhanced FMAP program in September 2010\u2014about $293 million funneled \"off-budget\" which was ladled out to Ohio hospitals, mental health providers and drug assistance for HIV positive patients as well as the state departments of aging and mental health.\n\nAdd this to our previous pile of federal money and you have about $17.3 billion in federal dollars that flowed into Ohio in the last budget cycle -- roughly $1.26 billion more than the budget proposed by Kasich.\n\nGoyal\u2019s statement did contain some element of truth, but the phrase he used was \"more federal dollars\" which should include all of the money coming from the federal government, not just funds flowing into the GRF.

Smith \"It was found unconstitutional to drug test elected officials because it prevents us, as citizens, from having that First Amendment right.\"", "evidence": "Miami Herald columnist Carl Hiaasen torched Florida lawmakers for passing a drug-testing bill for state workers that excluded one class of government employees: elected officials who passed the law.\n\nHiaasen took particular issue with the proposal\u2019s House sponsor Rep. Jimmie Smith, a Republican from Lecanto, and his explanation for a failed attempt to require drug tests for Gov. Rick Scott and legislators.\n\n\"It was found to be unconstitutional to drug test elected officials because it prevents us, as citizens, from having that First Amendment right,\" Smith said.\n\nThe defense was novel -- and also wrong. It turns out Smith confused elected officials with candidates, misinterpreted Supreme Court case law and cited the wrong amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nThe drug-testing bill signed into law by Gov. Rick Scott on March 19, 2012, allows state agencies to randomly test no more than 10 percent of their workforce every quarter. An employee who fails a test could be fired on the first offense. Scott said he will hold off implementing the new law until the outcome of an ACLU-led court challenge to Scott\u2019s 2011 executive order requiring random drug testing at agencies, an issue the Legislature tried to correct through law.\n\nDemocrats hurled pointed questions at Smith during a February committee hearing on HB 1205, including why he would not favor drug-testing elected officials.\n\n\"Are you saying with your bill you are not in favor of making elected officials have drug tests?\" asked Rep. Joe Abruzzo, D-Wellington.\n\n\"Our bosses, our constituents, want it and we should do it,\" Smith said, explaining he paid $40 for a drug test after a constituent asked him to do it.\n\n\"So would you be open to amending your bill?\" Abruzzo asked.\n\n\"No,\" Smith said.\n\n\"Why not?\" Abruzzo said.\n\n\"Because it is succinctly decided by the U.S. Supreme Court that drug-testing elected officials would violate the First Amendment right of freedom of speech by being elected,\" Smith said.\n\nWe called Smith for more information. He said he was referencing Chandler vs. Miller, a 1997 Supreme Court decision that overturned a Georgia law requiring candidates for state office to prove they passed a urinalysis drug test within 30 days of qualifying for the ballot. Passing it in 1990, Georgia was the only state with such a law.\n\nTwo lower courts had ruled with the state, finding that the drug tests were okay because of the substantial trust voters hold for their elected officials in terms of safety, economic well-being and law enforcement.\n\nBut the U.S. Supreme Court, in an 8-1 vote, overturned those rulings in a suit brought by Libertarian lieutenant governor candidate Walter Chandler (the defendant, Zell Miller, was governor of Georgia), arguing the drug-testing requirement violated the Fourth Amendment, which protects citizens from unreasonable search and seizure.\n\n\"However well-meant, the candidate drug test Georgia has devised diminishes personal privacy for a symbol's sake,\" wrote Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for the majority opinion. \"The Fourth Amendment shields society against that state action.\"\n\nThe law was not a response to a legitimate public safety concern about drug use among political candidates, Ginsburg continued, which might make blanket drug-tests permissible.\n\nThe court did not factor the First Amendment into its decision, even though the Libertarian candidates-turned-plaintiffs tried. They argued the drug tests violated their First, Fourth and Fourteenth amendment rights in their initial district court filing.\n\n\"If you refuse to take a drug test,\" Chandler argued, according to a 1997 USA Today account, \"it's like refusing to salute the flag of the drug war. For Libertarians, it's also like Georgia is saying: 'You can believe what you want. But you have to show contempt for what you and other Libertarians believe before you can even get on our ballot.' \"\n\nSo to recap: The Supreme Court tossed out a drug-testing requirement for candidates -- not elected officials -- based on the Fourth Amendment, not the First. The law wasn't tossed out on the grounds that they were candidates -- rather it was ruled invalid because it diminished someone's personal privacy.\n\nWe consulted First Amendment expert and attorney Patsy Palmer to be sure we weren\u2019t missing something. \"There is nothing that I know of which would extend First Amendment privileges exclusively to lawmakers in the field of urine testing,\" she said. \"There\u2019s utterly no case law on that as far as speech is concerned.\"\n\nShe added: \"Anything that would give an exclusive First Amendment right to lawmakers rather than other citizens of the state seems to be a stretch.\"\n\nWe should note the ACLU, which has strongly suggested it will sue over Smith\u2019s law, agrees that lawmakers should not be drug-tested. But not because of the First Amendment.\n\nThe group thinks state employees -- and elected officials -- should be protected by the Fourth Amendment.\n\n\"If the Fourth Amendment applies in the halls of the Florida House of Representatives -\u2013 and it does \u2013- it applies to other state office buildings as well,\" said ACLU spokesman Derek Newton.\n\nSmith, for his part, told PolitiFact Florida that the question about lawmaker drug-testing is irrelevant. Per state law, leaders of the state House and Senate are already allowed to \"adopt rules, policies, or procedures for the employees and members of the legislative branch\" for drug tests.\n\nThe outcome of the ACLU\u2019s legal challenge to Scott\u2019s drug-testing executive order remains to be seen. It\u2019s likely to influence implementation of the state\u2019s new law. We\u2019re not here to make that case.\n\nOur ruling\n\n"}

The Obama administration was instrumental in the manner in which the reorganizations proceeded. Some debt holders were forced to take losses, while the autoworkers union health care trust, which was owed billions in health benefits, took an equity stake, as did the federal government.\n\nDetails on the money\n\nThe Obama campaign responded to our inquiry with citations of several news stories about when the first loans were disbursed.\n\n* $5 billion to financing arm GMAC on Dec. 29, 2008\n\n* $4 billion to GM on Dec. 31, 2008\n\n* $4 billion to Chrysler on Jan. 2, 2009\n\n* $884 million to GMAC on Jan. 16, 2009\n\n* $100 million to financing arm Chrysler Financial on Jan. 16, 2009\n\nObama was inaugurated Jan. 20, 2009. So that adds up to almost $14 billion in auto bailout money before he took office.\n\nDetails on the spending\n\nThe campaign also sent us reports from early 2009 on where the money was going.\n\nSean McAlinden, chief economist for the Center for Automotive Research, told the Detroit News in January that \"GM and Chrysler are insolvent. Without federal funding they are bankrupt.\"\n\nHe added that Chysler needed $6 billion at the time to pay its suppliers for the previous quarter's auto parts, and he said he suspected the full $4 billion loan went towards those payments, the story said. (We reached out to McAlinden for our story but didn\u2019t hear back.)\n\nA Detroit Free Press story noted that GM was spending $7.5 billion per month on car parts at the time the government bailed it out. The Obama campaign pointed out that just a single month\u2019s expenses exceeded the amount GM received from the Treasury by $3.5 billion.\n\nABC News published a story in April 2009 quoting Neil Barofsky, the TARP inspector general, saying that Chrysler Financial had asked for more funds because \"they had basically used up the $1.5 billion that was lent to them.\"\n\nSome context\n\nWe ran this statement by Steven Rattner, who headed Obama\u2019s task force through the bailouts. He said it\u2019s accurate that the funds were exhausted.\n\n\"It got used up before we really were in the saddle,\" he said.\n\nBut he also pointed out that none of the parties involved -- not the Bush administration, the incoming Obama administration or the car companies -- thought it would be enough to bring the automakers back to solvency.\n\n\"Nobody thought it was going to solve the problem. This was a interim financing,\" Rattner said. \"This was all something we anticipated.\"\n\nA New York Times story from the time said the Bush loan \"gives the companies a few months to get their businesses in order but hands off to President-elect Barack Obama the difficult political task of ruling on their future.\"\n\nWe also think it\u2019s worth mentioning the implication in the video that the Bush administration did not put enough restrictions on the money. \"He decided to intervene, but in exchange for help the president would demand action,\" narrator Hanks says just before mentioning the Bush loans.\n\nObama himself has previously said the Bush team handed out billions and asked nothing in return, a statement we rated False.\n\nKeith Hennessey, a former Bush administration official, wrote on his blog in June 2009 about the many restrictions tied to the loans, including that the car companies pay down debt, limits on executive compensation and negotiated reductions in wages and benefits for autoworkers. And remember the companies\u2019 viability plans reviewed by Obama\u2019s task force? They were required under the terms of the Bush loans.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe Obama campaign movie says, \"the Bush administration had given the car companies $13 billion and the money was now gone.\"\n\n"}

Even though his statement is unclear, a spokesperson confirmed the mayor was referring to shootings by, not directed at, officers.\nWe wanted to know if there was support for his statement.\nThe best data we have suggests the mayor might be right, but we can\u2019t know for sure.\nNo nationwide data\nThere is a major stumbling block with claims like these: There is no national database of police shootings.\nThe FBI does collect some data on justifiable homicides by law enforcement, but it\u2019s not broken down to the city level. The agency also issues a Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted report, but it only goes up to 2014 (and it doesn\u2019t cover people killed or wounded by officers).\nTo make matters more complicated, the FBI\u2019s numbers are provided voluntarily by law enforcement agencies. (Only a small fraction of the 18,000 agencies who voluntarily participate in the program provide deadly force data.)\n\"Some cities would only report certain types of shootings,\" said Jonathan Maskaly, a criminology professor at the University of Texas at Dallas. \"Others would report everything. Cities with problems would tend to obfuscate.\"\nMaskaly said verifying Rawlings\u2019 claim \u2014 especially the \"all large cities\" component \u2014 is difficult without a comprehensive database.\nThat said, we were able to find officer-related shooting data for specific police departments, as well as documentation of lethal force from media sources. These accounts, while limited, do show Dallas has a low number of shootings by police compared to other cities.\nDallas vs. the rest of Texas\nThe Washington Post tracks fatal police shootings nationwide, as does The Guardian. Both recorded the same incidents \u2014 five lethal shootings in Dallas in 2015, and one in 2016.\nA Dallas Police Department spokesperson pointed us to online officer-involved shooting data. The department\u2019s \"officer-involved shooting\" data included lethal shots, shots that injured, and shots that missed. As a result of the broader parameters, the police department\u2019s data shows 11 shootings in 2015, but still just one for 2016.\nThere\u2019s just one problem \u2014 the one shooting the newspapers found in 2016 is different from the one in Dallas\u2019 data. The Guardian and Post included a shooting by a Mesquite Police Department officer in Dallas, whereas the police department data only counts its own officers.\nWe did our own count using these three sources plus a Google News search. The result revealed one additional shooting by a Dallas officer.\nThe numbers vary depending on if the data includes shootings by non-Dallas police officers that happened in Dallas (such as by the Mesquite Police Department) or just those by Dallas officers. Including non-DPD officers, there were 12 officer-involved shootings in Dallas in 2015 and three in 2016.\nCounting only the Dallas Police Department, however, there were 11 in 2015 and two in 2016. This is what Rawlings was referring to.\n\n"}

Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., announced her 2012 candidacy for the U.S. Senate, her campaign website displayed a 2006 news article that began with the words: \"Rep. Tammy Baldwin, one of the most liberal members of Congress.\"\n\nEvidently, Baldwin\u2019s congressional re-election campaign wasn\u2019t concerned about the candidate being cast as one of the most left-wing members of the U.S. House.\n\nCertainly Baldwin\u2019s critics aren\u2019t shy about portraying her in that way.\n\nOn Sept. 6, 2011, the day Baldwin announced her run for the seat being vacated by Democrat Herb Kohl, Republican Tommy Thompson\u2019s team weighed in. Darrin Schmitz, a consultant to the former Wisconsin governor and likely Senate candidate, issued a statement that said:\n\n\"Tammy Baldwin is a classic tax-and-spend liberal, and her ranking as the most liberal member of the House puts her clearly out of the mainstream of Wisconsin voters.\"\n\nSo does Baldwin, who has served in the House since 1999, rank as its most liberal member?\n\nAs evidence, Thompson cited a 2010 ranking of House members by the National Journal, a nonpartisan political magazine and website. Baldwin tied with six other House members for the most liberal.\n\nThe rankings were based on what the journal judged to be 93 votes taken in 2010 \u00a0that showed \"ideological distinctions between members.\" The largest number -- 59 votes -- were on economic issues.\n\nSo in one rating system, seven House members, including Baldwin, were rated the most liberal.\n\nLet\u2019s look at other major rankings:\n\nAmerican Conservative Union\n\nThe American Conservative Union says it promotes economic growth through lower taxes and reduced government spending, as well as liberty, personal responsibility, traditional values and national security.\" The organization said its 2010 rankings were based on 24 votes taken in 2010 that created a \"clear ideological distinction\" among House members.\n\nThe American Conservative Union had urged House members to vote, for example, against extending long-term unemployment benefits, for ending moratoriums on offshore drilling and against the repeal of the military don\u2019t ask-don\u2019t tell policy.\n\nBaldwin\u2019s rating: Zero on a scale of zero to 100, which the organization called a \"perfect liberalism score.\"\n\nThat certainly puts Baldwin at the extreme end of the spectrum. But it\u2019s also less of a distinction than it might appear: Baldwin was among 150 House members who received that score.\n\nAmericans for Democratic Action\n\nAmericans for Democratic Action is an organization that says it is \"committed to liberal politics, liberal policies and a liberal future.\" It ranks lawmakers based on their votes on what the group considers the 20 most important votes of the year. In 2010, the group urged House members to vote for measures such as health care reform, the extension of long-term unemployment benefits and repeal of don\u2019t ask-don\u2019t tell.\n\nBaldwin\u2019s liberal rating on the 2010 list: 100 percent.\n\nAgain, this ranking marks Baldwin as an extreme liberal, but it didn\u2019t exactly single her out. Baldwin was among 49 House members who received a perfect score.\n\nVoteview.com\n\nVoteview.com, a site created by political scientists, uses a complicated calculation based on patterns of how often each member of Congress votes with other members, and then plots them on a liberal-conservative spectrum. Voteview is different in that members are ranked based on the entire time they have served in the House.\n\nVoteview\u2019s latest rankings are for the 111th Congress -- members who served during the 2009-2010 session.\n\nBaldwin\u2019s ranking: 19th most liberal.\n\n(Note: After our item was posted, researchers with the group were able to pull out just the votes from the most recent session. Based on those votes, Baldwin would be tied for 12th most liberal.)\n\n"}

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said Monday night that he believes all prisoners \u2014 including \"terrible people\" like the Boston Marathon bomber \u2014 should be allowed to vote. He said people serving time, no matter how serious their offense, deserve enfranchisement.\n\"I think the right to vote is inherent to our democracy,\" Sanders said. \"Yes, even for terrible people, because once you start chipping away and you say that person committed a terrible crime, not gonna let him vote, or that person did that, not gonna let that person vote \u2014 you\u2019re running down a slippery slope.\"\nThe debate over whether released felons should vote was at the center of recent election in Florida. \"When they get out of jail, they certainly should have the right to vote,\" Sanders said this week. \"I do believe that even if they are in jail, they\u2019re paying their price to society, but that should not take away their inherent American right to participate in our democracy.\"\nSanders said this ideal has been the reality in Vermont since the state\u2019s founding. \"In my own state of Vermont, from the very first days of our state\u2019s history, what our Constitution says is that everybody can vote,\" he said. \"That is true. So people in jail can vote.\"\nIt\u2019s certainly true that all of Vermont\u2019s prisoners currently enjoy the right to vote, but has that been true since day 1 of the state\u2019s founding? The Sanders camp said it could not immediately reply to questions about the candidate\u2019s claim.\nVermont is one of just two states, the other being Maine, where prisoners currently have the right to vote. The Burlington Free Press described Vermont\u2019s prison voting system in an article following on Sanders\u2019 remarks. Even prisoners being held\u00a0out-of-state in Mississippi are given the opportunity to cast ballots in their most recent \"voluntary\" address back home.\u00a0\nDylan Lynch, a policy associate from the National Conference on State Legislatures, noted that four other states introduced legislation this year that would allow people to vote while incarcerated for a felony. In Connecticut, the measure failed, but in Louisiana, Massachusetts and New Jersey, bills are still pending.\nIt\u2019s also true that Vermont has allowed incarcerated people to vote since its founding. Vermont Secretary of State Jim Condos confirmed that incarcerated Vermonters have \"never had their right to vote taken away during incarceration.\"\nIn the 1790s, the Vermont Legislature tried to outlaw inmate voting, but it was overruled in a 1799 decision by the Council of Censors, a \"now-defunct fourth branch of government that met every seven years to decide constitutional questions,\" according to a 2008 Associated Press story. Vermont\u2019s 1793 Constitution was interpreted to mean that the loss of voting rights could only occur in response to voter fraud. That case was cited as precedent as recently as the 1980s, in the most recent attempt to outlaw inmate voting in Vermont.\nVermont\u2019s current Constitution states that every person who is 18 years old and a citizen of the United States, \"having resided in this State for the period established by the General Assembly and who is of a quiet and peaceable behavior \u2026 shall be entitled to all the privileges of a voter of this state.\"\n\n"}

President Donald Trump has promised to cut their federal funding, a move supported by Blackburn.\nWe wanted to know if Blackburn was accurate in her claim that Phoenix\u2019 murder rate dropped 27 percent after the city abandoned a sanctuary policy. We did find a decline in the murder rate, but the extent attributable to a policy change is questionable.\nDid Phoenix have a sanctuary policy?\nThere\u2019s no widely accepted legal definition for \"sanctuary cities,\" but the term is generally applied to jurisdictions that claim that immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility, not a local one. They argue that reporting individuals to immigration officials can undermine communities\u2019 trust in law enforcement officers.\nPhoenix officials pushed back on the premise that the city ever had sanctuary policies.\n\"The city has never been a \u2018sanctuary city\u2019.

Jonathan Howard also told PolitiFact they\u2019ve \"never had a policy that made us a sanctuary city.\"\nBlackburn did not return repeated requests for information for this fact check.\nBut we found that some groups considered Phoenix a sanctuary city based on a police department policy up to 2008.\nJudicial Watch, a conservative group that litigates on public corruption and other issues, in May 2008 issued a statement saying the Phoenix police chief was making changes to a policy which the group said \"prohibited police officers from inquiring about the immigration status of individuals and from cooperating with federal immigration officials.\"\nThe Center for Immigration Studies, which favors low immigration, in August 2010 also said that until 2008, \"Phoenix was considered by many to be a sanctuary for illegal aliens.\"\nA 2010 report from Police Executive Research Forum said a policy prohibiting Phoenix officers from contacting immigration officials was interpreted by some as providing a \"sanctuary city\" for undocumented immigrants. That policy came under scrutiny after a police officer was shot and killed in September 2007 by an immigrant in the country illegally, the report said.\n\n"}

Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas said government spending cuts, not tax increases, are the best tool.\n\n\"We think the government is spending too much,\" the Republican said during a June 29 interview on CNBC. \"The only growth sector that we've had in the last two years in America is government growth. That's not the way to come out of this massive $14 trillion debt burden that most surely is going to affect the middle class, and so I think the answer is not to tax anyone further, but to cut government spending.\"\n\nWe wondered if Hutchison's government growth statement was on the money.\n\nDuring the interview, Hutchison didn't specify what kind of growth she was talking about. Her office told us later that she was referring to employment.\n\nTo support Hutchison\u2019s statement, her office sent us a graph originally posted in February in a blog on the website of the conservative Heritage Foundation, which attributed the figures to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The bureau, which is the government\u2019s official source for job numbers, breaks down data on total (nonfarm) employment in several ways, including into the broad categories of \"private\" and \"government\" jobs but also into more detailed private industry sectors such as manufacturing and health care.\n\nThe graph compares employment trends in two categories \u2014 the hefty private sector and the much smaller federal government \u2014 over a three-year period, from January 2008 (the month after the latest recession began) to January 2011.\n\nAccording to the graph, the federal workforce, excluding postal and temporary census workers, grew 11.7 percent in those years while private-sector employment fell 6.6 percent.\n\nThat seems to support Hutchison's statement. However, the graph's time period doesn't align perfectly with the two-year period mentioned by Hutchison. Also, it solely tracks a subset of federal government workers, a qualification Hutchison did not make in her statement.\n\nIn the CNBC interview, Hutchison specified a time period of \"the last two years.\" Yet the graph covers a three-year span that ended five months before the interview.\n\nSignificantly, when assessing employment trends, altering a time frame \u2014 even slightly \u2014 can change the picture. That's so in this case with private-sector employment.\n\nHutchison\u2019s office correctly pointed out that the number of private-sector jobs is far lower (about 6 percent) than it was before the start of the recession in December 2007. Yet, figures show, there has been private-sector growth more recently.\n\nAt the time of the senator's interview, the most recent monthly employment data available from BLS was for May 2011. We found that between May 2009 and May 2011, private-sector jobs increased by about half a million (from 108.4 million to 108.9 million). There also was growth over the two-year period from April 2009 (108.7 million) to April 2011 (108.8 million).\n\nThen again, the result flip-flops \u2014 showing private-sector job losses \u2014 if you start the two-year comparison with March, February or January of this year.\n\n"}

The legislation also would reduce the deficit by at least $2.1 trillion between 2012 and 2021, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nPart of those savings comes from the following provision: if the enactment of legislation from a new committee does not achieve the requisite estimated savings by Jan. 15, 2012, automatic spending cuts totaling up to $1.2 trillion would kick in. Those spending cuts would be spread over fiscal years 2013 through 2021.\n\nBut Jason Peuquet, a policy analyst with the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, pointed to four similar cases, going back to 1985, where a debt ceiling increase was tied to spending cuts or related budget enforcement procedures.\n\nIn 1985, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings (GRH) Act was enacted as part of a nearly $175 billion increase in the debt limit. That act set targets to reduce the deficit. If those targets were not met, automatic spending cuts would be instituted through a process called sequestration.\n\nReferring to that act, political science professor Steven Smith of Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., said in an email: \"The first time ever claim (from Runyan) is only narrowly technically correct. The debt limit increase in 1985 provided for ratcheting down the deficit, which surely required spending cuts but could have been achieved through revenue increases.\"\n\nFive years later, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990 also tied spending cuts to a debt limit increase. That legislation increased the debt ceiling by $915 billion, but also mandated spending cuts to help achieve nearly $500 billion in deficit reduction over a five-year period.\n\nIn 1997, then-President Bill Clinton and the Republican-controlled Congress would reach a similar agreement with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. In addition to increasing the debt limit from $5.5 trillion to $5.95 trillion, the bill also made net reductions in direct spending of $122 billion over five fiscal years.\n\nJust last year, when federal officials approved a $1.9 trillion increase in the debt limit, they also attached a measure known as the Statutory PAYGO Act of 2010. Under that act, if tax cuts or spending increases are not fully offset, across-the-board spending cuts would be made to a select group of mandatory programs.\n\nAll of these examples carry the same punch line: the new deal is not the first time that spending cuts have been linked to a debt ceiling increase.\n\n\"This recent August deal is nothing new,\" Peuquet said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn a recent mailer, Runyan claimed the Budget Control Act of 2011 marked the \"first time ever\" that a debt ceiling increase was linked to spending cuts. But our research shows that similar connections have been made at least four times within the past three decades"}
{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Facebook posts \"Nearly 100,000 people get shot every year. That's 270 people a day and 87 dead.\"", "evidence": "In the wake of the mass shooting in Aurora, Colo., Americans took to social media to express their views on guns and violence.\n\nA reader sent us one Facebook post about the extent of gun violence in the United States. It said, \"USA is #1 in gun violence. Nearly 100,000 people get shot every year. That's 270 people a day and 87 dead because of gun violence every day.\"\n\nIn this item, we\u2019ll look at the second half of that claim: \"Nearly 100,000 people get shot every year. That's 270 people a day and 87 dead.\"\n\nThe numbers\n\nWe turned to statistics from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; experts in the field told us it keeps the most reliable statistics on the subject. The CDC collects two sets of relevant data.\n\nThe first is data for deaths by guns, which is included in an annual report about deaths of all types during calendar year 2009. The numbers for gun deaths is broken down into several categories:\n\nSuicide: 18,735 deaths\nHomicide: 11,493 deaths\nUnintentional: 554 deaths\nLegal interventions: 333 deaths\nUndetermined: 232 deaths\n\nTotal: 31,347 deaths\n\nThe second data set tracks non-fatal injuries by guns. According to the CDC, there were 73,505 non-fatal firearm injuries in 2010. (We will ignore an additional 13,851 non-fatal injuries from BB or pellet guns.)\n\nHow accurate is the Facebook post?\n\nIf you add together the gun deaths and the non-fatal gun injuries, you get 104,852 people shot every year. That\u2019s very close to what the Facebook post said. The Facebook post was also close in its daily averages -- 287 people shot every day, and 86 deaths by gun every day.\n\nThere\u2019s one area, however, in which the Facebook post could have benefited from additional context. It says that \"nearly 100,000 people get shot every year,\" which to us suggests that a victim is being shot by someone else. In reality, a significant majority of gun deaths comes from self-inflicted firearm wounds.\n\nIf you ignore the suicides -- and if you assume that relatively few people survive a suicide attempt with a firearm (we couldn\u2019t find any hard data on that question) -- then the number of people who got shot, either fatally or non-fatally, was about 86,000, or roughly 235 a day. That\u2019s lower than the Facebook post indicated. And the daily number of firearm deaths would be substantially lower -- 35 per day, rather than the 87 cited in the Facebook post.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe numbers in the Facebook post are close to accurate, as long as you make one major assumption -- that suicides count as \"get(ting) shot.\" We think that assumption is debatable, but there is no question that at least 100,000 people did die or become injured from firearms"}

It\u2019s the new kid in Washington, as far as government agencies go, created by the passage of the 2010 massive financial regulation overhaul known as Dodd-Frank.\nThe bureau, which opened in 2011, has rulemaking powers, supervises certain financial institutions and checks out complaints from consumers about lending practices that may violate the law.\nAn editor of the conservative news website Townhall claimed it has more nefarious aims.\nA reader asked us to look into the thrust of a June 19 story by news editor Katie Pavlich, also a Fox News contributor and conservative author, who said the agency granted itself authority to shut down businesses for basically any reason.\n\"Last week the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, through the power of Dodd-Frank, passed a rule giving the agency unprecedented power to shut down businesses, no matter what the reason, at any time it wishes through a cease-and-desist order,\" Pavlich wrote.\nThat seemed like a lot of unilateral power, so we wanted to look into her claim.\nFederal rulemaking fun\nWe tried to reach Pavlich through email and Twitter, but she did not respond. Her article links to a post on CFPB Monitor, a blog maintained by the Ballard Spahr law firm, about the agency adopting a final rule on temporary cease-and-desist orders.\nJust one problem: The cease-and-desist order isn\u2019t what Pavlich thinks it is.\nOne of Ballard Spahr\u2019s attorneys told us the rule Pavlich referenced is not meant to gut businesses\u2019 rights and is typical of other federal and state financial regulators.\n\"It\u2019s not like a blank check to put somebody out of business,\" said Christopher Willis, a Ballard Spahr partner and consumer finance attorney who represents financial institutions that would be subject to the rule. \"It\u2019s supposed to be tied to stopping someone from violating the law.\"\nHere\u2019s how Willis explained it to us: \u00a0When the agency thinks a business has broken the law, the agency can file a lawsuit, pursue administrative proceedings or do a cease-and-desist order. But a cease-and-desist order is to cease-and-desist violating the law -- not to stop existing.\nMoreover, the agency didn\u2019t give itself the power to issue cease-and-desist orders, Congress did. Section 1053(c) of the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act allows the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to conduct cease-and-desist proceedings.\nSo, in September 2013, the agency developed an interim rule that spells out how to do what Congress wanted. Essentially, the rule says the agency\u2019s director may issue a temporary cease-and-desist order when he or she finds a company\u2019s alleged unlawful action will render it unable to pay debts or \"otherwise prejudice the interests of consumers.\"\nAn earlier CFPB Monitor post equated this kind of order with a temporary restraining order in a judicial proceeding. The order is enforceable once served.\n\n"}
{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Rick Scott Says his tax and fee cuts will save households \"$540 over two years.\"", "evidence": "One of the best ways to show voters the impact of tax cuts is to break them down in a way people can appreciate.\n\nTake Gov. Rick Scott's budget roll-out the week of Feb. 7, 2011. Scott says his spending plan includes $4.1 billion in tax and fee relief over two years. That sounds good, but it means little to someone unfamiliar with the inner workings of the state budget.\n\nSo Scott's budget team decided to boil that figure down to show the impact on Florida households.\n\nIn a graphic showing the proposed tax relief for 2011-2013, Scott's budget gurus added this simple-to-digest sound bite: \"Total Savings Per Household, $540 Over Two Years.\" The figure got repeated by various media outlets.\n\nSo we wondered, is it right?\n\nNo doubt about it, Scott's budget proposal includes a variety of tax and fee reductions. Among them:\n\n\u2022 Reduce the corporate income tax from 5.5 percent to 3 percent in 2011-2012 and from 3 percent to 2.5 percent in 2012-2013. The rate cut will save those who pay the tax $459 million this year and a little more than $1 billion in 2012-2013.\n\n\u2022 Reduce the required local effort, a property tax to fund schools, saving taxpayers around $600 million in 2011-2012. The tax cut would carry forward in 2012-2013.\n\n\u2022 Reduce the property tax collected by state water management districts 25 percent for two years, saving taxpayers $180 million annually.\n\n\u2022 Reduce unemployment compensation taxes by shortening how long Floridians can collect benefits and making it more difficult for them to be eligible. Scott's office says that will save $630.8 million over two years.\n\n\u2022 Roll back 2009 Legislature-approved fee increases for driver licenses, vehicle registrations and other motor vehicle fees. Scott says the rollback would save drivers $492 million over two years.\n\n\u2022 Repeal or alter other small taxes on ammonia, pesticides, fertilizer, solvents, dry cleaning, tires and lead acid batteries, among other things. The changes would save $77 million over two years, Scott's office says.\n\nTaken together, Scott's says the savings for taxpayers is $4.1 billion over two years. (For the record, we question that overall figure because most cuts in the second year of Scott's budget aren't additional cuts; they are just the same cuts rolled over.)\n\nBut what's critical in determining a per-household savings is remembering just who will get the tax breaks. And, who won't.\n\nTwo of the three biggest tax cuts -- the reduction of the corporate income tax and the changes to the unemployment compensation tax -- apply only to corporations. So unless your household is like Rick Scott's and you own a corporation, you'll see no direct savings under Scott's plans. Supporters of the cuts argue that the benefits could trickle down to average Floridians through additional jobs or cheaper prices for goods and services. But there's no guarantee either will happen.\n\nThe cuts to the corporate income tax and the unemployment compensation tax make up $2.1 billion of Scott's overall $4.1 billion impact.\n\nIn comments to the Senate Budget Committee on Feb. 9, 2011, Scott budget chief Jerry McDaniel said Scott's top tax priority was to remove taxes that he says inhibit job creation. McDaniel said Scott particularly wanted to reduce and eventually eliminate the state's corporate income tax.\n\nWe asked McDaniel after the\u00a0 Feb. 9 meeting if he knew whether the per-household figure accounted for the corporate tax cuts. McDaniel said he did not know and suggested we e-mail the governor's press office seeking clarification. We did, but did not hear back.\n\nSo we did the math ourselves.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census, Florida had 6,337,929 households in 2000 (the last year that precise data is available). However, the state's Demographic Estimating Conference meets annually to project the number of Florida households, among other things. At their most recent meeting on Oct. 25, 2010, the group estimated that as of Jan. 1, 2011, Florida would have roughly 7.5 million households. The group's estimates are based on the active number of residential electric customers and residential building permits.\n\nUsing the most recent household estimate, it's easy to see the error in Scott's tax cut math.\n\nNot counting the cuts to the corporate income tax and the unemployment compensation tax, the average household would see in the neighborhood of $267 in tax savings over two years, not $540. ($2 billion / 7.5 million = $267 per household). That's an annual savings of around $134, or less than half of what Scott suggested.\n\nThe $540-per-household figure Scott used to\u00a0sell his\u00a0budget plan is intended to\u00a0appeal to voters who would relish\u00a0a hefty tax cut, even over two years. But he failed to factor in that more than half of those tax cuts would apply only\u00a0to employers, not regular Floridians. In calculating the savings, it appears clear that Scott and his office simply divided the entire tax cut as projected by Scott -- $4.1 billion -- by the entire number of Florida households -- 7.5 million -- to reach their average savings of $540. That's easy math. But it's deceptive"}

So there's some good things happening.\"\n\nHis claim that Florida fourth graders are oh-so-close to being the world\u2019s best readers piqued our interest.\n\nRight away, we found his source: results from the latest Progress in International Reading Literacy Study.\n\nThe study is coordinated by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement and completed every five years since 2001. It examines reading achievement and habits of American fourth graders and their peers across the world. In 2011, fourth graders from 53 countries and subnational entities participated.\n\nThat year, Florida used federal grant money to be evaluated independently of the United States -- the only U.S. \"benchmarking\" state for the PIRLS exam. Florida paid $1.9 million from a federal Race to the Top grant for this assessment and two other international studies, including the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS)\u00a0of fourth and eighth graders.\n\nThe PIRLS results, released December 2012, surprised state officials. The average score of Florida fourth graders ranked No. 2, above the average for the United States.\n\n\"Second in the world. To be able to use those words is ... wow,\" Mary Jane Tappen, a deputy chancellor at the Florida Department of Education, told the Orlando Sentinel.\n\nThe gaps between reading scores for the highest achieving countries were not statistically significant. Florida\u2019s score was just two points short of No. 1 Hong Kong -- not Singapore, as Scott said. Florida edged out Russia and Finland by one point, and Singapore by two points. Northern Ireland, the U.S., Croatia and Chinese Taipei were in the second highest tier of readers, followed by Ireland and England.\n\nThat\u2019s not the only way to look at the data. Florida did finish second behind Singapore in terms of the percentage of fourth-grade students scoring in the advanced reading level (24 percent vs. 22 percent).\n\nOne measure isn\u2019t exactly better than the other, said Martin West, associate professor at Harvard\u2019s Graduate School of Education.\"These are just slightly different ways of cutting the data and the distribution of achievement in a given system,\" West said.\n\nThe results vouch for Florida\u2019s success in improving reading achievement in elementary grades, West said. In 1998, Florida fourth graders were well below the national reading average, but they were performing well above the national average by the late 2000s, he said.\n\n\"They made considerable progress over the course of that decade,\" West said. \"They\u2019ve sort of held their level over the past couple of years.\"\n\nHow important is the ranking? Chad Minnich, an editor at the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center at Boston College, warns against considering results based on rank. A more useful takeaway, he said, is to look at the increased number of countries who scored above the test\u2019s high international benchmark, and that Florida did very well among those.\n\nStill, we wondered what would have been had other states been evaluated on their own. Florida\u2019s education system has been getting a lot of accolades lately, but it\u2019s still not in the upper echelon of states like Massachusetts, Maryland, Connecticut and New Jersey.\n\nMost people consider the annual National Assessment of Education Progress, dubbed \"the nation\u2019s report card,\" to be the best state-by-state measure of state education systems. The exam is given to a sample of fourth, eighth and 12th grade students every two years in reading and math.\n\nFlorida students typically perform above average on the NAEP. States including Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland -- states with vaunted education systems -- are usually top dogs.\n\n\"It\u2019s certainly the case that based on this data from NAEP, we know that there are at least a handful of states that were they to participate, they would be likely to perform at higher levels than Florida,\" West said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nScott said Florida students are second in the world in fourth grade reading, behind Singapore, and offers a study as evidence.\n\nThe study backs his claim up, to a point.\n\nFlorida students finished second in overall reading to Hong Kong, not Singapore. In the percentage of advanced readers, Florida ranked second behind Singapore.\n\nBut it\u2019s important to note these rankings do not account for every country in the world. Or every state in the United States. In fact, Florida was the only state included in the ranking Scott cited because Florida paid to be included.\n\nScott would have been correct to say Florida finished second in the study, but he stretched the truth a bit when he said Florida ranked second in the world.\n\nIt would have been more accurate to say Florida ranked second among 53 education systems that were included"}

{"label": "false", "claim": "Republican National Committee \"2008: Unions Spent $400 Million to Elect Obama.\"", "evidence": "An ad from the Republican National Committee says that unions that supported President Barack Obama should stop fighting a budget deal in Wisconsin.\n\n\"Obama and the union bosses are standing in the way of economic reform,\" the ad says, adding \"Stop Obama and his union bosses today.\"\n\nOnscreen, the ad shows the words, \"2008: Unions Spent $400 Million to Elect Obama.\"\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that unions strongly supported Obama over Republican John McCain in the last election. But was it to the tune of $400 million? We decided to check it out.\n\nThe ad cited Politico and the Wall Street Journal as its sources, so that\u2019s where we went first. Both reported in March 2008 that liberal groups said they hoped to raise $400 million to spend in 2008. About $300 million would come from unions, and the rest from non-union advocacy groups, including MoveOn.org, ACORN and Emily\u2019s List.\n\nSo the part attributed to unions was $300 million, not $400 million. We also noticed that both the Wall Street Journal and Politico repeated the number in other news stories without attributing the information to a specific source. So we started looking around for evidence of whether the unions had succeeded at raising the hundreds of millions they said they would in March 2008. Keep in mind, the most detailed reports mentioned the number as a goal, not an amount that had already been raised.\n\nOur attempts at independent confirmation were difficult, because unions do not have to report all of their campaign spending to the Federal Election Commission, according to independent campaign finance experts. The unions do have to report direct contributions to candidates and parties and some of their independent expenditures. But they do not have to report internal communications to membership, and they don\u2019t have to report get-out-the-vote efforts, even if the efforts are focused on heavily Democratic areas.\n\nWe contacted the staff at the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan organization that tracks campaign spending. They told us that it would be impossible to account for all union spending during the 2008 cycle; the law doesn\u2019t require that level of disclosure.\n\nBut in the data required to be reported, the center found $75 million in direct contributions from unions and union members to candidates and parties, of which over $68 million went to Democrats. It also found $86 million in outside spending by labor in the 2008 cycle, which largely benefited Democrats. It also identified an additional $52.7 million in spending from labor groups \u00a0in 527 organizations, tax exempt organizations that seek to influence elections. Add it up, and you get $206.7 million.\n\nThe $400 million discussed in March might have been aspirational and not actually achieved, said Eric S. Heberlig, a political scientist who studies the labor movement at the University of \u00a0North Carolina Charlotte. \"The pressure to empty their coffers to help Obama out was less when they saw he was easily able to raise that amount of money elsewhere,\" he said.\n\nIndeed, Obama raised an unprecedented amount of cash on his own. Public disclosures showed he raised $745 million, compared with John McCain\u2019s $368 million.\n\nThe RNC said the unions \"spent $400 million to elect Obama.\" We do want to acknowledge that independent publications have reported that number to be the case. But when we looked into the sources for that number, we found that it was the unions themselves discussing what they hoped to raise in the 2008 election. Furthermore, the reports said they wanted to raise $300 million, not $400 million, and it was a goal, not something they had yet achieved. When we looked at the public disclosures after the election, we found the unions reported $206.7 million in spending for all Democrats. It's clear that the unions raised additional money for get-out-the-vote activities, but we don't know how much more -- nor does the RNC. Finally, all that money went to support Obama and other Democrats, not just Obama alone. In short, we don't see the evidence to support that unions spent $400 million to elect Obama"}

Allow us to have some fun, too, by taking a look back at France's Sun King.\nFirst: How did the king, who lived from 1638 to 1715, make it day to day? Like his father before him, biographies suggest, he often was on the move, waging war (the \u201cnatural condition of nations\u201d in the era, recapped Nancy Mitford, in her book, \u201cThe Sun King\u201d) or hunting while staying in palatial abodes capped by his beloved chateau at Versailles, which he proclaimed the seat of government in 1682.\nVersailles, of late a spectacular tourist attraction, grew on the king\u2019s watch to include picture-perfect gardens, a theater holding 3,000 spectators, a vast hall of mirrors, hundreds of imported orange trees (many planted indoors in silver tubs)--all of that a far cry from the rustic hunting lodge his father had enjoyed there. That building, which his son preserved, consisted of just (only) (barely) 20 rooms plus a men\u2019s dormitory.\nTuneful aspect of the king\u2019s lifestyle: He was seldom without music, awakening each morning to the playing of a live band, according to Mitford.\nSo, how does Perry fare comparatively?\nWe\u2019re unaware of live bands playing as Perry awakens. And the governor doesn\u2019t routinely hunt (though he recently said he shot and killed a coyote during a jog) nor is he known to bounce from palace to palace nor has he declared war -- except on Washington.\nThen again, Perry incorrectly maintained last year that Texas could secede; his intimation could be seen as war-like.\n\n"}

In remarks after the Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses, Trump drew an explicit comparison between his proposed wall and the Great Wall of China.\n\"They say you\u2019ll never be able to build a wall,\" Trump said on March 2, 2016. \"Well, it\u2019s 2,000 miles but we really need 1,000 miles.

And this is going to be a serious wall. This is going to be a high wall. This is going to be a very serious wall.\"\nA number of people asked us to check whether Trump\u2019s description of the Great Wall -- that it was built 2,000 years ago and that it\u2019s 13,000 miles long -- was accurate.\nAfter checking with scholars of the period, we found that the numbers Trump are grounded in reality, but that there\u2019s a lot of nuance that\u2019s been lost in the process.\nThe wall was \u2018built 2,000 years ago\u2019\nAs a starting point for the Great Wall\u2019s construction, \"2,000 years ago\" has some merit. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and other groups say that around 220 B.C., efforts began to link together existing earthen walls on modern-day China\u2019s northern frontier.\nBut today, those early walls are barely discernible, if at all. Better constructed portions of the wall only came into existence much later -- and over many centuries,\u00a0said Lynn A. Struve, an East Asian historian at Indiana University and author of\u00a0Time, Temporality, And Imperial Transition: East Asia From Ming To Qing..\n\"Almost every dynasty contributed to building the wall,\" said Arthur Waldron, an East Asian historian at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of the seminal 1992 volume, The Great Wall of China: From History to Myth. (The bottom portion of the figure below shows the full historical timeline.)\n\u00a0\n\nIndeed, the most familiar and best-preserved portions of the wall are more recent than Trump indicated -- only 300 to 600 years old. They were built during the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644), when the Great Wall became the world's largest military structure, according to UNESCO.\n\"The Great Wall you see today was almost entirely built in the 1500s under the Ming dynasty,\" said Kenneth M. Swope, a University of Southern Mississippi historian and author of A Dragon's Head and a Serpent's Tail: Ming China and the First Great East Asian War, 1592-1598.\nThe wall\u2019s length \u2018is 13,000 miles\u2019\nIn citing this figure, Trump can point to an official statistic. In 2012, China's State Administration of Cultural Heritage released a five-year-long study that the wall is 13,170 miles long -- much longer than the previous estimate of 5,500 miles, which was limited to the Ming-era structures.\n\n"}

Fulton is taking steps to raise its countywide tax rate for the first time since 1991.\nLeaders in Georgia\u2019s largest county say the state constitution was on their side when they voted last year to repeal a property tax cap that affects only Fulton. That set the stage for this year\u2019s proposed increase.\nBut state lawmakers point to House Bill 604, which bars Fulton from raising taxes until 2015. Any tax increase above the rollback rate \u2013 the millage that would raise the same money as last year \u2013 violates that law.\n\"Contrary to law, the Fulton County Commission has taken preliminary action to move forward to increase property taxes,\" state Sen. John Albers, R-Roswell, wrote in an email blast to constituents. \"This is both illegal and immoral.\"\nIllegal?

The commission could lower the rate from the one advertised when it adopts the final rate this summer.\n\"A final millage rate will not be set until our citizens have had an opportunity to be heard,\" Eaves said. \"We are duly elected to ensure that the services our citizens have come to expect are available to them.\"\nThe tax for general county services in Fulton is currently 10.211 mills.

PolitiFact Ohio decided to check into his claim.\n\nWhen the movie tax credit was established in 2009, Dovilla was not in office.\n\nLawmakers included the movie tax credit in the state budget passed that year.

The expansion doubled the money available through the credit from $10 million per year to $20 million per year.\n\nWhen we contacted Dovilla to explain his claim, he said the campaign literature was not meant to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between the expansion of the movie tax credit and the decision to film part of \"The Avengers\" in Cleveland.\n\n\"It says the tax credit helped bring films like \u2018The Avengers\u2019 to Cleveland, not the expansion,\" he said.\n\nDovilla said the phrase \"which helped bring films like \u2018The Avengers\u2019 to Cleveland\" referred to the tax credit itself, not the expansion of the tax credit.\n\nDovilla also said he believes the average person in his district would know that the Avengers was filmed in Cleveland well before lawmakers extended the tax credit and, therefore, the average person would understand that the original movie tax credit \u2013 passed before Dovilla took office \u2013 brought the Avengers to Cleveland, not the expansion that he sponsored.\n\nMike Dittoe, a spokesman for House Speaker William G.

It expanded traditional Election Day voting to include early voting sites. Starting in 2002, Floridians could also request a \"no excuse\" absentee ballot, so anyone could vote by mail for any reason.\n\nIn 2011, the Florida Legislature passed a new law (HB 1355) that made a variety of changes to rules for early voting. The legislation cut the number of days of early voting from 14 to eight, and it eliminated voting the final Sunday before Election Day. In 2012, that means that Floridians can early vote Sunday, Oct. 28, but not Nov. 4 -- two days before Election Day.\n\nWe should point out that early voting on the final Sunday was never required. Instead, it was an option for counties, and \u00a0only about 10 of 67 took advantage of it in 2008, including some counties with higher minority populations.\n\nSmaller counties generally chose not to have early voting on Sundays, because officials figured people were attending church or spending time with their families rather than going to vote, said Vicki Davis, Supervisor of Elections in Martin County and now president of the statewide association of election supervisors.\n\nWhen legislators decided to get rid of early voting on the final Sunday, some county officials were disappointed, while others wanted that last Sunday to prepare for Election Day, she said.\n\nThe state is required to get federal approval for any changes in voting law for five counties that have had historical voting problems, including Hillsborough County. The state has sought approval from a federal three-judge panel in Washington and several voting rights\u2019 groups have filed objections with the court. The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law has argued on the side that claims that the law will disproportionally harm minority voters. None of the five pre-clearance counties offered early voting on that final Sunday in 2008.\n\nResearchers examined the race of voters on the final Sunday\n\nBrown\u2019s spokesman said that the statistics about minority voting on the final Sunday came from the NAACP, and we found several researchers have cited similar statistics to Brown\u2019s claim.\n\nThey arrive at those numbers by obtaining statewide early vote data and then matching voters\u2019 information with registration records which list self-reported race and ethnicity.\n\nHere is what professors and lawyers found for who voted early on Sunday Nov. 2, 2008\n\nThe Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law:\n\u2022 African-American: 33.2 percent\n\u2022 Hispanic: 23.6 percent\n\nThe Brennan Center was focused on the impact of minorities and didn\u2019t list a percentage for whites.\u00a0\n\nUniversity of Florida political science professor Daniel A Smith and Michael Herron, professor of government at Dartmouth:\n\n\u2022 Whites: 40 percent\n\u2022 African American: 34 percent\n\u2022 Hispanics: 24 percent\n\u2022 Asian: 2 percent\n\n\"We find that Democratic, African-American, Hispanic, younger, and first-time voters were\ndisproportionately likely to vote early in 2008 and in particular on weekends, including the final Sunday of early voting,\" wrote the professors in a paper.\n\n"}

Trump imposed additional import taxes on Chinese goods in 2018, then raised many tariffs again \u2014 from 10% to 25% \u2014 in May 2019 after trade talks broke down. He unexpectedly announced another round of tariffs Aug. 1, 2019.\u00a0\nAlong the way, China has responded by raising tariffs as well.\u00a0\nBut it was the President\u2019s repeated description of funding for that bailout that caught our eye.\n\"We are doing great with farmers now in a lot of ways. One way is we\u2019re giving $16 billion out of all the tariffs we\u2019re collecting,\" Trump told WTMJ-TV\u2019s Charles Benson in a July 12, 2019, interview in Wisconsin. \"Sixteen billion dollars all comes out of the tariffs that we\u2019ve gotten from China.\"\nTrump also referenced tariff payments \"from China\" when he\u00a0announced the farm aid plan in May and many times since, including a July 30, 2019,\u00a0news conference where he referred to \"taking in billions and billions of dollars from China in the form of tariffs.\"\nIs that really how tariffs work?\nTariffs 101\nThe short answer is no.\nHere\u2019s a description from the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent group that models the effects of tax legislation.\nA tariff is a tax on imported goods. Despite what the President says, it is almost always paid directly by the importer (usually a domestic firm), and never by the exporting country. Thus, if the US imposes a tariff on Chinese televisions, the duty is paid to the US Customs and Border Protection Service at the border by a US broker representing a US importer, say, Costco. The Chinese government pays nothing, just as the US government pays no tax to Canada for that nation\u2019s tariffs on imported dairy products. Rather, an importer or supplier for a Canadian supermarket pays the duty on Wisconsin cheese that lands in the grocer\u2019s dairy counter.\nThat explanation, written in September 2018, noted that Trump has a \"troubling lack of understanding about how the levies work.\"\nThe International Monetary Fund reported in May that this is indeed what happened, saying tariffs imposed on China have \"been borne almost entirely by U.S. importers.\"\n\n"}

The first daily train would leave Cleveland at 6:30 a.m. and arrive in Cincinnati at 1 p.m.\n\nLarkin then shared a railroad timetable from New York Central Lines, effective Feb 3, 1935. It showed a departure time of 3:10 p.m. from Cincinnati and an arrival in Cleveland of 8:20 p.m., for a travel time of 5 hours 10 minutes -- an hour and 20 minutes faster than the 3C line.\n\nCriticism of the 3C as \"snail rail\" with an average speed of 39 mph started as soon as the project was proposed.\n\nThe Ohio Department of Transportation responded in September with a new average estimate of 50 mph and \"speed up to 79.\" It shortened the Cleveland-to-Cincinnati trip to 5 hours 12 minutes.\n\nBut, not so fast.\n\nAs an October story in the Columbus Dispatch noted, ODOT itself had said a year earlier that the trip couldn't be made in less than 5 hours 20 minutes -- even if the trains didn't stop. ODOT\u2019s revised schedule hadn't even been seen by the three freight lines that own the tracks the 3C passenger trains would use, putting its feasibility in serious doubt.\n\nAnd, no matter how weak or strong its support, the optimistic revision still comes up longer than the best rail time of 1935.\n\n\"The schedules speak for themselves,\" Larkin said"}
{"label": "false", "claim": "Jeff Kottkamp \"Only a few months ago the FBI arrested three Broward County Commissioners for accepting millions of dollars in trade for illegal favors.\"", "evidence": "Arrests of public officials in South Florida have been common headlines in recent years. We've been witness to all sorts of drama including a school board member sticking cold hard cash in a doggie bag and later made famous by a photo of her running away from the cameras, a county commissioner receiving money in a golf bag and later crying at the courthouse, and an ex-city commissioner who once resolved a spat at Winn-Dixie with a gun and was later defiant at his sentencing in a corruption probe.\n\nAll three of those officials hailed from Broward County -- a place where perhaps the most common question among observers and critics of politicians is, \"Whose next?\"\n\nRepublican Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottkamp, who is running for attorney general, wants such government corruption stopped. But does Kottkamp have his facts right on which government officials had the handcuffs slapped on them for which crimes?\n\nOn the morning of July 30, we looked at Kottkamp's campaign website and found his position paper on \"Stopping Government Corruption\" in which he vows to crack down on officials who violate the public's trust.\n\nKottkamp wrote: \"Only a few months ago the FBI arrested three Broward County Commissioners for accepting millions of dollars in trade for illegal favors. This rash of public corruption lead the Governor to petition the Florida Supreme Court to empanel a grand jury to investigate corruption in South Florida. I support this effort as a necessary first step to restore public confidence in government.\"\n\nFor this claim, we will evaluate that first sentence in three parts: Were three Broward County Commisisoners arrested by the FBI? Did the three accept millions of dollars? And were the arrests a few months ago?\n\nWe started with the Broward County Commission. So far, the feds have arrested only one Broward County Commissioner -- Josephus Eggelletion on Sept. 23, 2009 -- in a scheme in which he participated in laundering about $900,000 and profited about $23,000. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering. In March, a tearful Eggelletion was sentenced to 30 months in prison.\n\nIn July, the Broward State Attorney's Office announced the arrest of Broward County Commissioner Diana Wasserman-Rubin for seven counts of unlawful compensation, but the FBI was not involved. Prosecutors have accused her of repeatedly voting on grants that benefitted her husband who received $45,000 in bonuses. She has denied wrongdoing and has not had her first court hearing.\n\nBut Eggelletion wasn't the only Broward notable to land in prison this year. On the same day that federal prosecutors announced their case against Eggelletion, they unveiled charges against School Board Member Beverly Gallagher (the doggie bag/dashing away from the press politician) and former Miramar City Commissioner Fitzroy Salesman who was later defiant at his sentencing. Here is the press release that summarizes the separate charges in the Broward cases. Gallagher pleaded guilty to bribery for accepting about $9,000 from undercover agents posing as consultants trying to get school district business. In June she was sentenced to 37 months in prison. Salesman was convicted of bribery and extortion at trial for taking $3,340 from undercover agents who were trying to get business from the city of Miramar. Salesman was sentenced in July to 51 months in prison.\n\nSo there clearly weren't three Broward County commissioners busted by the FBI -- only one Broward county commissioner was arrested by the feds. Or another way of looking at it: two politicians in Broward and a former politician in Broward were convicted after federal corruption probes -- none of which involved the convicts pocketing anywhere close to millions.\n\nBut there were three Palm Beach County commissioners -- the county immediately to the north of Broward -- who were convicted in federal corruption probes between 2007 and 2009: Tony Masilotti, Warren Newell and Mary McCarty. There were also a list of other public officials in Broward -- including two on the Deerfield City Commission and a Davie town manager -- who have been charged with corruption in recent years.\n\nWe spoke with Kottkamp campaign manager Jill Gran and spokesman David Bishop at about 10:40 a.m. July 30, 2010, and told them we thought the claim was wrong.\n\n"}

The donation, and others like it, raises questions about whether Clinton went \"soft\" on Algeria for contributing to her husband\u2019s cause under the appearance of earthquake relief in Haiti, Marcus wrote.\nScarborough said the situation will \"stink to high heaven\" even if it\u2019s a legal gray area.\n\"I think it was Algeria, maybe, that had given a donation that went unreported at a time when they wanted to be taken off of the terror list in the State Department,\" Scarborough said. \"They write the check, they get taken off the terror list. ...

I don't know, that's really hard to tell,\" he said.\nScarborough went on to break down to his panelists how easy it would be to explain to voters what might have occurred.\n\"This is pretty simple stuff. So Algeria is on the terror list, they want off the terror list, the State Department's making a decision to do it, they write a check for what? How much? How many million dollars do they write a check for? I don't know, but Algeria writes a check. You're from Boston, you know how politics works. They write a really big check to the Clinton Foundation,\" Scarborough said. \"The Clinton Foundation takes the check, and then just, out of nowhere the State Department then decides, well, they are going to take Algeria off the list. Now why did Algeria write a big check to the Clinton Foundation at the time they want something from the State Department? That's pretty simple for most voters.\"\nThe problem with all of this isn\u2019t the donation, or questions about a quid pro quo with Algeria.

Tom Graves of Georgia is worried about the nation\u2019s spiraling debt and how much of it is owned by China.\n\nGraves, whose district consists of 15 northwest Georgia counties, including Forsyth, talked about the problem of deficit spending at a recent town hall meeting.\n\n\"Two days of interest we pay to China is enough to buy one joint strike fighter [jet],\" Graves told the largely receptive crowd, according to the Cumming Patch website.\n\nThose aircraft usually cost astronomical sums of money, so we wondered whether the congressman\u2019s math was correct. On average, does the United States really pay that much money in debt to China? Or did Graves use hyperbole to scare his town hall audience about the rapidly growing economic influence of China?\n\nOur friends at PolitiFact Virginia did some of our homework for us. In April, they fact-checked a claim by U.S. Rep. J. Randy Forbes, R-Va., that the federal government pays China nearly $74 million a day in debt interest.\n\nPolitiFact Virginia found U.S. Treasury Department reports that show China holds about $1.165 trillion of the national debt. In the most recent 12-month period available, the U.S. spent about $197 billion in interest payments on its debt. Since China owns about 12.8 percent of the U.S. debt, PolitiFact Virginia assumed that country received a similar percentage of the debt interest payments, which for fiscal year 2010 would total nearly $69 million a day. But since the debt increased in the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, PolitiFact Virginia did some more math and determined the interest payments to China would be $74.4 million a day, which earned Forbes a True rating on its Truth-O-Meter. Two days of interest payments would total nearly $150 million.\n\nSo, the next question: How much do these jets cost?\n\nThe cost to produce a joint strike fighter jet, also known as the F-35, has caused a stir in Washington in recent months. They\u2019re being made by Lockheed Martin, which has a plant in Marietta, and are said to be the most technologically advanced jets ever developed. The jets are being made for the Air Force, Marines and Navy. For the Marines and Navy, it will be the first time they have stealth jets, said Joe DellaVedova, a spokesman for the F-35 Joint Program Office.\n\nThey\u2019re also very expensive, and some members of Congress are angry about the rising costs. Defense Department officials recently told the U.S. Senate\u2019s Armed Services Committee that the cost for some of the initial planes ordered was 11 percent to 15 percent higher than expected.\n\n\"Disgraceful,\" tweeted U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Az., who has been critical of F-35 cost overruns.\n\nCost estimates are all over the place in news accounts. The most accurate estimate came from a Defense Department report that officials say was leaked to the news media a few months ago. The price to build and operate 2,443 of the jets was recently estimated to be about $93 million to $112 million apiece, according to a 2010 Pentagon report. DellaVedova did not dispute the cost estimate.\n\nSo if we take two days of interest payments, which we believe adds up to about $150 million, that total does eclipse the highest estimate for a F-35 jet, $112 million. Graves\u2019 office estimates the total cost per jet at about $132 million, using a July report from the Congressional Research Service. It used the PolitiFact Virginia report to determine the average daily debt payment to China.\n\nWe believe Graves has a good argument to base his claim"}

Overall, they disagreed, noting the ways in which it runs counter to current public health strategies.\u00a0\nLet\u2019s take it point by point.\n\u2018Open the schools\u2019\nIn March, when government and public health leaders realized the novel coronavirus was spreading throughout the U.S., many public institutions \u2014 including schools \u2014 were ordered to shut down to prevent further spread. Many students finished the 2020 spring semester remotely. Some jurisdictions did choose to reopen schools in fall 2020 and spring 2021, though others have remained remote.\nThroughout the pandemic, researchers have studied whether in-person learning at schools contributes significantly to the spread of COVID-19. The findings have shown that if K-12 schools adhere to mitigation measures \u2014 masking, physical distancing and frequent hand-washing \u2014 then there is a relatively low risk of transmission.\nAnd getting kids back into the classroom is a high priority for the Biden administration.\nIn a\u00a0Feb. 3 White House press briefing, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said data suggests \"schools can safely reopen.\" The CDC on Feb. 12 released guidance on how schools should approach reopening. It recommends the standard risk-mitigation measures, as well as universal masking, contact tracing, creating student learning cohorts or pods, conducting testing and monitoring community transmission of the virus.\nSusan Hassig, associate professor of epidemiology at Tulane University, said science shows that schools can open safely if \"mitigation measures are implemented and maintained in the school space.\"\nHere\u2019s some of the latest research that tracks with these positions:\n\nOnly seven COVID-19 cases out of 191 were traced to in-school spread in 17 rural K-12 Wisconsin schools that had high mask-wearing compliance and were monitored over the 2020 fall semester.\nMississippi researchers found most cases in children and teenagers were associated with gatherings outside of households and a lack of consistent mask use in schools, but not associated with merely attending school or child care.\nThirty-two cases were associated with attending school out of 100,000 students and staff members in 11 North Carolina schools, where students were required to wear masks, practice physical distancing and wash hands frequently.\n\nOf course, there are some limitations to these studies, which often rely on contact tracing, a process that can\u2019t always pinpoint where cases originate. Some of the studies also rely on self-reporting of mask-wearing by individuals, which could be inaccurate.\nAdditionally, Hassig pointed out that not all school districts have the resources, such as physical space, personnel or high-quality masks, to open safely.\nSexton\u2019s\u00a0assertion that schools can reopen leaves out a key piece of information: that safe reopening is highly dependent upon use of mitigation measures that have been shown to tamp down virus spread.\n\u2018Stop wearing masks outside\u2019\nBecause the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is relatively new, the research on outdoor mask use is limited. But so far science has shown that masks prevent virus transmission.A CDC study published Feb. 10 reported that a medical procedure mask (commonly known as a surgical mask) blocked 56.1% of simulated cough particles. A cloth mask blocked 51.4% of cough particles. And the effectiveness went up to 85.4% if a cloth mask was worn over a surgical mask.\n\n"}

That\u2019s less clear.\n\nLeft unspoken by Kremer are several other important components of the federal budget. The remaining $334 billion for fiscal year 2011 would have to cover such expenses as these:\n\nOther mandatory programs: $716 billion\nNon-security discretionary spending: $507 billion\nSecurity discretionary spending (primarily defense and homeland security: $908 billion\n\nTotal: $2.131 trillion.\n\nNow, it\u2019s certainly possible to shrink these categories -- but getting down to $300 billion or $400 billion is not easy.\n\n\"Other mandatory programs\" include those that are not funded annually by Congress but instead receive funds according to a pre-set formula. These include federal civilian and military retirement benefits, food stamps, unemployment compensation and veterans benefits. It\u2019s possible to rewrite formulas for these programs in a way that drastically shrinks or even eliminates them, but it would pose a major challenge, both legislatively and politically.\n\nThe second category -- non-security discretionary spending -- is easier to cut in a practical sense, but even within this category are lots of expenditures that, while discretionary, aren\u2019t easy to let go of, from food and drug safety to air traffic control.\n\nFinally, Kremer\u2019s comparison devotes not a dime to either the military or homeland security. Even cutting the current amount in half -- a course that\u2019s almost entirely impractical in the short term -- would exceed Kremer\u2019s excess amount for 2011 by more than one-third.\n\n\"Long before the country had Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security, it had an Army and Navy,\" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. \"I think the omission of \u2018national defense\u2019 from Ms. Kremer\u2019s list of essentials is a pretty important clarification.\"\n\nRating Kremer\u2019s statement is challenging, because what she said is undeniably true, but narrowly so, with missing factors that undercut her statement\u2019s relevance. When we asked an ideologically diverse group of economists how useful they thought Kremer\u2019s formulation was, their answers ranged widely.\n\nFor instance, J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation, noted that some of the excess costs that Kremer left out of the equation could be picked up by reining in factors she did include. \"If we're going to play \u2018what if,\u2019 then you have to allow that she may have wanted to cut some of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security to make room for other spending that was off the list,\" he said.\n\nKremer deserves credit for doing the math correctly. However, her decision to ignore defense and homeland security spending -- to say nothing of mandatory programs like veterans benefits and safety-related discretionary spending -- makes the comparison of questionable value to a discussion of the nation\u2019s budget problems"}

{"label": "true", "claim": "Bill Clinton The Obama administration is allowing state waivers from welfare work requirements \"only if they had a credible plan to increase employment by 20 percent.\"", "evidence": "Former President Bill Clinton used his elder statesman\u2019s status in the Democratic Party to make the case for Barack Obama\u2019s re-election, while touching on a subject paramount in his own legacy: welfare reform.\n\nIn 1996 Clinton signed a landmark bill that transformed welfare from an indefinite entitlement to temporary assistance for poor Americans that required them to eventually join the workforce.\n\nMitt Romney, in a campaign ad, has claimed that Obama gutted the work requirement.\n\nClinton countered that in his Sept. 5 speech at the Democratic National Convention. Here\u2019s what Clinton said really happened:\n\n\"When some Republican governors asked if they could have waivers to try new ways to put people on welfare back to work, the Obama administration listened because we all know it\u2019s hard for even people with good work histories to get jobs today. So moving folks from welfare to work is a real challenge.\n\n\"And the administration agreed to give waivers to those governors and others only if they had a credible plan to increase employment by 20 percent, and they could keep the waivers only if they did increase employment. Now did I make myself clear? The requirement was for more work, not less.\"\n\nAt PolitiFact, we have examined this welfare controversy before. Here, we\u2019ll review the issue in light of Clinton\u2019s new statement.\n\nThe HHS memo\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSince 1996, welfare has been administered through block grants to states. The grant program, called Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, or TANF, limits how long families can get aid and requires recipients to eventually find a job. It also includes stringent reporting requirements for states to show they are successfully moving people into the workforce.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA July 12, 2012, memo from George Sheldon, acting assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), said the department wanted to give states more flexibility in meeting those requirements. The memo notifies states \"of the Secretary\u2019s willingness to exercise her waiver authority ... to allow states to test alternative and innovative strategies, policies, and procedures that are designed to improve employment outcomes for needy families.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe memo outlined the kinds of waivers that would be considered. It suggested projects that \"improve collaboration with the workforce and/or post-secondary education systems\" and \"demonstrate strategies for more effectively serving individuals with disabilities,\" to give two examples.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat does that mean?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"If you can do a better job connecting people to work, we would consider waiving certain parts of the performance measures and use alternate measures,\" is how Liz Schott, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, translated the memo\u2019s point. (The center supports the plan.)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe waivers, then, would inject some flexibility. For example, someone with a special-needs child might require different work arrangements than are currently allowed. Or a person who needs to improve his or her English skills might need more time to take classes.\n\nSebelius\u2019 letter\n\nHHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius reasserted the intent of the changes in a July 18 letter to Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.\n\n\"The proposal we have outlined strengthens the law\u2019s purpose to move people off of welfare and into jobs by utilizing state-based innovation. Our goal is to accelerate job placement by moving more Americans from welfare to work, and no policy which undercuts that goal or waters down work requirements will be considered or approved by the Department,\" Sebelius wrote.\n\nShe noted how, in 2005, several governors sought such flexibility in welfare and state waiver authority. That letter was signed by 29 Republican governors, including Mitt Romney of Massachusetts.\n\nNow, some states are again asking for flexibility, Sebelius wrote, naming Utah and Nevada, which both currently have Republican governors. She said some of the policies they requested would not meet the new HHS requirements.\n\n\"The department is providing a very limited waiver opportunity for states that develop a plan to measurably increase the number of beneficiaries who find and hold down a job. Specifically, governors must commit that their proposals will move at least 20 percent more people from welfare to work compared to the state\u2019s past performance,\" Sebelius wrote. \"States must also demonstrate clear progress toward that goal no later than one year after their programs take effect. If they fail, their waiver will be rescinded.\"\n\nBecause no waivers have yet been approved, it\u2019s difficult to say exactly what the changes would look like.\n\nThe policy debate\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIt\u2019s important to note that the waivers would not just be a change on paper. Schott said it\u2019s possible that waivers will allow states to get credit under the work requirement for activities that don\u2019t count currently.\n\nSchott offered the hypothetical scenario that a state might change some requirements for specific subgroups, such as two-parent families, possibly by letting them stay in school longer. A waiver would let the state count those parents toward its work participation requirement. That is credit a state doesn\u2019t get now and that could be counted toward a 20 percent improvement.\n\nThat broader definition has some critics concerned. Robert Rector, a welfare expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said it could ultimately allow \"state bureaucrats\" to count activities that aren't really work.\n\n\"In the past, state bureaucrats have attempted to define activities such as hula dancing, attending Weight Watchers, and bed rest as \u2018work.\u2019 These dodges were blocked by the federal work standards. Now that the Obama administration has abolished those standards, we can expect \u2018work\u2019 in the TANF program to mean anything but work,\" Rector argued.\n\nHe also wrote, following Clinton\u2019s speech, that the 20 percent increase Sebelius is demanding is a \"meaningless measure\" because in a typical state 1.5 percent of welfare recipients leave the program for work every month. To increase that by 20 percent would be a bump to only 1.8 percent of recipients gaining employment.\n\n\"What will the other 98.2 percent of the caseload be doing? No one knows for sure. But one thing we do know for certain: They will be exempt from the federal \u2018work participation\u2019 requirements established in the welfare reform law,\" Rector wrote.\n\nSchott counters that the 20 percent improvement measure doesn\u2019t exempt anyone from working.\n\n\"Nothing about the waiver lifts the work requirement on any individual. The waiver is about the state\u2019s performance measurement,\" she said. \"The federal work participation requirement is something that states must meet. \u2026 Nobody is suggesting waiving that.\"\n\nRector also contends that Sebelius is not legally authorized to issue waivers of existing work requirements. He argues that the part of the law allowing waivers does not cover TANF work provisions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Critically, this section, as well as most other TANF requirements, is deliberately not listed... its provisions cannot be waived,\" Rector wrote in a July 12 column in the National Review.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nHis argument on that point got an important affirmation this week when the Government Accountability Office said that Sebelius\u2019 waiver proposal is \"subject to the requirement that it be submitted to both Houses of Congress and the Comptroller General before it can take effect.\" The Obama administration did not ask for Congress\u2019 approval to grant waivers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOur ruling\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nClinton said in his convention speech that the Obama administration \"agreed to give waivers to those governors and others only if they had a credible plan to increase employment by 20 percent, and they could keep the waivers only if they did increase employment.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThat's an accurate recap of the planned changes to Temporary Assistance to Needy Families. By granting waivers to states, the Obama administration is seeking to strengthen welfare-to-work efforts by letting states try different approaches based on their residents\u2019 needs. That\u2019s important too -- the waivers would be considered for individually evaluated pilot programs. HHS is not proposing a blanket, national change to welfare law.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe waiver offering was spurred by requests from several governors, including Republican governors, and Sebelius explicitly stated that only requests that \"demonstrate clear progress\" toward enhancing employment will be approved by HHS.\n\nClinton\u2019s statement is accurate"}

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "John Thrasher Says taxpayer resources are being used \"to facilitate private political agendas\" through automatic payroll deduction of union dues.", "evidence": "Some Republicans in the Florida Legislature are squaring off against unions over a measure that would prohibit public employers from collecting union dues through automatic payroll deductions.\n\nRepublicans call the measure \"paycheck protection,\" and say it gives individual union members more power over how their dues money is spent. The law would prohibit public unions from utilizing payroll deductions and would require unions to get annual authorizations from members to use their dues for political reasons. But opponents liken the measure to union busting, saying it will make it more difficult for unions to collect dues. They also argue that the law is unnecessary because Florida is a right-to-work state where no employee can be forced to join a union and pay union dues. By choosing to join the union and pay dues, members are effectively supporting the union's agenda.\n\nThe back-and-forth has played out several times in House and Senate committee hearings where the bill has been considered. The House version, HB 1021, is being sponsored by Rep. Chris Dorworth, R-Lake Mary. Its Senate companion, SB 830, is sponsored by Sen. John Thrasher, R-St. Augustine.\n\nThrasher argued before the Senate Community Affairs Committee on March 14, 2011, that another reason to support his bill is to remove the government costs of processing union dues collections -- which in turn could be used for political purposes. Thrasher said he had heard from taxpayers who thought \"their resources ought not be used to facilitate private political agendas.\"\n\nIn the middle of a complex policy discussion, this seemed like an important fact to pin down -- what do governments spend on collecting union dues through payroll deductions?\n\nWe caught up with Thrasher on the Senate floor to ask him if he had more information about the costs to government. He said he did not, but that there had to be some cost just by the nature of the government performing a task -- payroll deduction -- on behalf of a private entity.\n\n\"We need to get state and local governments out of the business of being involved in political purposes,\" he said, echoing comments he made to the Senate committee members.\n\nPayroll deduction is common for all workers. Employees automatically have money taken out of their paycheck to pay for all kinds of things. Some deductions are voluntary: student loans, charitable donations, health insurance, life insurance, union dues. Some deductions are not: taxes, alimony and other court-ordered deductions.\n\nThe state of Florida currently has 364 groups or agencies that have the ability to take money directly from employees' paychecks. Here's the entire list provided to PolitiFact Florida by the state Chief Financial Officer's Office.\n\nThree different state legislative analysts have examined the bill, and all at least attempted to see how much governments spend deducting union dues from pay checks. The answer was generally not much, if anything.\n\nA House staff analysis said the elimination of payroll deduction for employee unions \"may result in a positive, but insignificant, fiscal impact on public employers.\"\n\nA second House analysis said the elimination of payroll deductions \"may result in a neutral fiscal impact to public employers.\"\n\nA Senate staff analysis declared the fiscal impact to governments \"indeterminate.\"\n\nThe CFO's office, which oversees the state payroll system through the Bureau of State Payrolls, told PolitiFact Florida that the process for setting up payroll deduction is \"by and large automated.\"\n\nSpokeswoman Alexis Lambert said it's as simple as some group requesting a deduction, that request being approved or denied, and then the bureau assigning a deduction code. \"The bureau's deduction code process is, by and large, automated and represents a minimal cost,\" Lambert said.\n\nPractically speaking, there is some personnel time required to set up the deduction and that's about it.\n\nState statutes also permit governments to ask unions to pay for deduction costs as part of collective bargaining. Section 447.303, which discusses dues collection for public employees, says that \"reasonable costs to the employer of said deductions shall be a proper subject of collective bargaining.\"\n\nAnd then there's Dorworth, the House sponsor, who told members of the House Budget Committee on March 21, 2011, that eliminating payroll deductions isn't a cost-savings measure. In responding to a question about the cost of eliminating the payroll deductions, Dorworth said, \"I tend to agree. There's not any (financial) impact either way.\"\n\nWhatever the state spends on processing payroll deductions, it is so small no one can quantify it. Governments also could ask unions to pay for the cost as part of a union's collective bargaining agreement. There are reasons to vote for this bill, and Dorworth and Thrasher have articulated them, but cost isn't one of them"}

Kelly\u2019s source is a 2013 white paper that cites Cook and Ludwig\u2019s survey as its source, according to a spokesperson for Americans for Responsible Solutions.\nThe survey was based on a small sample (251 people) and counted background checks on firearm purchases before the 1996 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which required federal background checks on firearm purchases, was enacted.\nThere\u2019s debate among researchers on whether the 40 percent figure still holds true today, and Cook and Ludwig have both said that no one knows the current percentage of guns sold without a background check.\nRobert Spitzer, a SUNY Cortland political science professor and author of The Politics of Gun Control, noted that the background check statistic is \"notoriously slippery,\" because gun sales that don\u2019t go through a federally licensed seller are, as you would expect, not subject to formal record keeping.\n\"How would a researcher identify a sufficiently large and representative sample of non-background check gun purchases/exchanges, given the absence of a paper trail?\" Spitzer said. \"My general sense is that 40 percent might be on the high side but is certainly possible.\"\nNevertheless, it\u2019s the best estimate we have, said Jon Vernick, co-director of the Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, adding,\u00a0\"There's no good reason to believe that the number has changed substantially \u2014 though we can't know for sure.\"\nLudwig told PolitiFact\u00a0that he can see why people use the 1994 survey as the benchmark, \"even though everyone recognizes the estimate is now old.\"\nSo why is the most recent statistic on gun purchases without background checks about two decades old?

Instead, he is now clinging to a variation of a boast we rated as False when we first heard him utter it in January.\nBack then, he declared Chicago in 2017 enjoyed the \"highest employment in the private sector in the history of the city.\" His revised variation narrows the comparison by more than a century and no longer explicitly confines it to workers in the private sector.\n\"Chicago is experiencing right now the highest employment since 1950,\" Emanuel declared recently during a public television interview on WTTW\u2019s \"Chicago Tonight\" program.

We sought clarification from a mayoral spokesman, but he did not provide it.\nBut, in a nutshell, the answer to our question is no. State and federal headcounters conduct different jobs tallies, but none render numbers that match the superlatives uttered by the mayor either now or in January.\nUnderlying our skepticism of Emanuel\u2019s initial claim was an obvious demographic reality: Chicago\u2019s population has been shrinking for decades and, at 2.7 million residents, is 900,000 fewer than its 1950 peak recorded by the Census.\nEarly this year, an Emanuel spokesman said the mayor\u2019s numbers came from an annual report from the Illinois Department of Employment Security. That report does not tally jobs held by Chicago residents, but rather private-sector jobs located in the city held by Chicagoans and suburbanites alike.\nFor 2017, that report showed 1.18 million private-sector jobs in the city, the highest number reported by the state since 1990 when it recorded 1.2 million private-sector jobs for Chicago. But the report series dates back to the late 1950s, and for most years prior to 1990, the city\u2019s private-sector jobs count far exceeded its 2017 tally.\n\n"}

Rick Perry agreed to authorize in-state college tuition for certain children of illegal immigrants living in Texas.\nNow, the Houston state senator says in a campaign ad that he is \"the only candidate for lieutenant governor to oppose in-state tuition for illegal immigrants.\"\nPatrick is among Texans jockeying for the GOP nomination to fill the post overseeing the Senate. The others are third-term incumbent David Dewhurst, state Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson and state Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples.\nIn 2001, when the law came to be, neither Patrick, Dewhurst or Patterson had direct says on it. Dewhurst was then the state land commissioner and Patterson was a former state senator.\nStaples was an East Texas senator and among the vast majority of legislators who voted for House Bill 1403, which became the law that lets undocumented students who have graduated from a Texas high school and lived in Texas for at least three years qualify for in-state tuition \u2014 if they sign an affidavit saying they intend to apply for permanent residency as soon as they're able to do so.\nThrough August 2011, 38,656 non-U.S. citizens and permanent residents had attended Texas colleges or universities at in-state tuition rates, according to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.\nAnd as we noted in a 2011 article, only five of 181 Texas House and Senate members voted against the legislation. The Texas House passed the measure 142-1 before the Senate approved an amended version by 27-3, with Republicans Mike Jackson of La Porte, Jane Nelson of Flower Mound and Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio in opposition. Staples was among a dozen Republicans voting \"aye,\" according to the Senate Journal entry for that day. The House went along with the Senate version with Rep. Jerry Madden, R-Richardson, pushing the legislation\u2019s total tally of \"no\" votes to five.\nIn 2011, Sen. Brian Birdwell, R-Granbury, filed a proposal to repeal the tuition law, but it never made it past the four Republicans and three Democrats who comprised the Senate Higher Education Committee, the Austin American-Statesman said in a Sept. 28, 2011, news article.\nBirdwell then offered an amendment on the Senate floor that was intended to keep illegal immigrants from qualifying to pay in-state tuition. A document posted online by Patrick\u2019s campaign on behalf of his ad notes that Patrick was among four Republican co-authors of that amendment. According to the Senate Journal showing that May 9, 2011, action, Birdwell withdrew the amendment without the Senate voting on it.\nAccording to the Senate\u2019s video of Birdwell\u2019s presentation of his floor amendment, Patrick did not speak during the 30-minute floor discussion; seven other senators asked questions or made statements.\nLegislative records also indicate that Patrick filed his own repeal proposal in the 2009 regular session; it did not get a hearing.\nSo, is Patrick the only one among the four candidates \"to oppose\" in-state tuition for illegal immigrants?\nHe\u2019s not the only one who opposes it. Staples has said he favors repealing the law. Dewhurst has said that if had been governor in 2001, he would not have signed it into law. And Patterson has said he opposes the benefit, stressing that the issue of legal residency status should be dealt with first.\nBy email, Staples\u2019 campaign spokesman Kent Sholars provided a statement from Staples saying: \"I oppose giving benefits to those who have violated our nation\u2019s entry laws. If that bill came up for a vote today, it would not pass, and I support its repeal.\"\nSholars also provided a video excerpt of Staples referring to the 2001 legislation during an Oct. 3, 2013, candidate forum in Houston. Staples, who left the Senate in early 2007, said that the measure \"that created in-state tuition was predicated on the assumption that those students would correct their status. That has not been enforced. And it should be repealed.\"\nGood reminder. In 2010, we reported that neither the Texas Education Agency, the coordinating board or the University of Texas at Austin was checking on whether students had applied for permanent residency as they were promising to do in the required affidavits. Institutional officials told us that no law required such follow-ups.\nBy email, board staff spokesman Dominic Chavez recently told us that state law remains silent on designating an agency to check on students seeking legal residency, but the board now has rules requiring affected colleges and universities to retain student affidavits indefinitely or until a student documents compliance. Also, Chavez said, the board has instituted a policy requiring institutions to annually counsel students about their responsibilities in accord with the affidavits.\n\n"}

Pat Roberts of Kansas is doing everything he can to paint his opponent -- independent Greg Orman -- as a liberal henchman.\nOne of Roberts\u2019 favorite points is Orman\u2019s stance on the Affordable Care Act. Orman says he does not support the health care law, but he also says pushing legislation to repeal it is impractical, because President Barack Obama would simply veto it.\nIn a recent Web video, Roberts treats that view as support for Obamacare.\nThe ad starts out with video of Orman shaking hands with constituents, one of whom asks him a question about repealing Obamacare. Orman replies, \"That\u2019s an interesting question,\" and moves on down the line.\n\"Greg Orman won't repeal Obamacare,\" the ad\u2019s narrator says, \"even though 20,000 Kansans lost their health insurance because of it.\"\nRoberts was expected to easily win a fourth term (the last time Kansas elected a Democrat to the Senate was in 1932). Then, Democratic candidate Chad Taylor dropped out, and independent Orman surged in the polls. Now the race is a toss-up. Some see a Roberts win as necessary for Republican Senate control in 2015.\nBoth candidates say they do not support Obama\u2019s health care law, but we wanted to know how the law had affected Kansas -- did 20,000 people really lose their health insurance?\nThe answer, it seems, is no.\nHow many Kansans lost insurance?\nWe asked Linda Sheppard, health policy adviser for the Kansas Insurance Department, how many Kansans had lost their insurance due to Obamacare. She said the state does not require health insurance carriers to report when people go on or off coverage, so there\u2019s no way to definitively know the answer.\nHowever, Sheppard said insurance carriers do have to check in with the department when they decide to terminate a policy. So 20,000 people losing health insurance would have likely come to her attention.\n\"We are not aware of any wide-scale cancellation of policies,\" she said.\nHere\u2019s what happened. About a year ago, in October 2013, Kansas\u2019 largest insurance carrier -- Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas -- sent letters to about 9,450 policyholders, according to numerous news reports. Those members would be unable to renew their plans for 2014 because those plans do not comply with new standards under the Affordable Care Act.\nSheppard told us there are no official numbers for how many people received these notices from insurance carriers other than Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas.\n\n"}

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Rand Paul The debt limit deal \"allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.\"", "evidence": "A bipartisan, bicameral deal to stave off a possible government shutdown and a breaching of the federal debt limit is now on its way to President Barack Obama\u2019s desk. But as it was moving toward congressional approval, some Republican presidential candidates spoke out against it during the GOP debate in Boulder, Colo., arguing that it represented an abdication of fiscal responsibility.\nOne of the critics at the debate was Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. \"Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit,\" Paul said. \"It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.\"\nWe wondered if Paul was accurately describing the bill, so we took a closer look.\nThe measure in question is the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. (Here\u2019s a summary.) The part of the bill that Paul is referring to -- section 901 -- would temporarily lift the limit on how much money the federal government is permitted to borrow. If the debt limit had not been lifted, the government wouldn\u2019t have been able to pay its outstanding debts, with potentially serious economic consequences and negative reactions from equity and other markets.\nHistorically, the most common mechanism for raising the debt limit was to set a new cap in dollars. Usually, it was possible to estimate how much time would pass before this limit would be reached, based on expected spending patterns, but it was only an estimate.\nThe current legislation, however, utilizes a mechanism that has been used a few times in the past few years. Rather than setting a new dollar amount, it suspends the debt limit until a date certain -- March 15, 2017, which is a few months after a new president and a new Congress are sworn in. So under the newly passed legislation, there is no longer a dollar limit on how much debt the United States can accrue.\nHowever, it\u2019s an exaggeration to say that the measure \"allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.\"\nTo understand why this is so, we\u2019ll take a look at the two types of federal spending -- mandatory spending (which includes both interest on the debt and expenditures commonly known as \"entitlements\") and discretionary spending.\nGenerally speaking, mandatory spending is determined by a fixed formula and continues on autopilot until Congress and the president change the rules. Discretionary spending, by contrast, must be approved periodically in appropriations bills passed by Congress and signed by the president.\n\n"}

President Gerald Ford initiated a massive immunization effort that resulted in some 45 million Americans getting a swine flu vaccine. The flu never went beyond Fort Dix, and the immunization program was halted, but among those who got the vaccine, more than 500 people got a rare neurological illness called Guillain-Barre Syndrome, an auto-immune disease that affects the nervous system and can cause paralysis. Two dozen people died from it. Understandably, many Americans grew wary of flu vaccines, particularly since the swine flu never materialized outside Fort Dix.\nBut was the flu vaccine really responsible for all those people developing Guillain-Barre?\nIn 2003, the Institute for Medicine commissioned a medical panel, called the Immunization Safety Review Committee,\u00a0 to look into it. The issue is complicated by the fact that Guillain-Barre can be triggered by all kinds of influenza. So how much was the vaccine to blame? The panel  concluded  that \"the evidence favored acceptance of a causal relationship\" between the 1976 swine flu vaccine and Guillain-Barre in adults.\nHowever, the panel concluded that in the nearly 30 years of administering the seasonal flu vaccine since then, there was no proof that the vaccines had caused any more cases of Guillain-Barre, or any other neurological diseases, for that matter.\n\"The evidence was at most weak that the vaccine could act in humans in ways that could lead to these neurological problems,\" the panel concluded.\nSo what about the risk of the H1N1 vaccine now?\nDoctors say the track record of seasonal flu vaccines shows the new one is safe.\n\"The vaccine was made essentially the same way vaccines have been made for the last 30 years,\" said Dr. Marie C. McCormick, a Harvard University professor who chaired that 2003 committee.\nConcerns about neurological issues with the H1N1 vaccine \"are not based on the evidence we have at hand today,\" McCormick said.\nIn addition to studies conducted by the five pharmaceutical companies that manufacture the H1N1 vaccine, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has conducted clinical trials on more than 4,000 people, and the only side effects recorded so far amount to little more than sore arms and stuffed-up noses.\nStill, that's a relatively small sample, too small to ferret out any possible connection to Guillain-Barre, which in 1976 was recorded in just 1 in every 100,000 people who got the vaccine.\n\n"}

He should be ashamed of himself. Jobs should have gone up two-and-a-half times.\"\nIs the use of food stamps -- formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP -- really two-and-a-half times higher than it was when Obama took office?\nThe short answer is that it\u2019s higher -- but not by nearly that much. And in recent years, it\u2019s been falling.\nAs we\u2019ve noted, SNAP is the federal government\u2019s largest food program, eclipsing other big farm-bill food spending for school lunches and breakfasts and for Women, Infants and Children. It helps low-income people buy groceries, usually with benefit cards that work like debit cards.\nTwo factors undergird the rise in food stamp use during Obama\u2019s presidency.\nThe first is that the number of food stamp beneficiaries ticked upward under President George W. Bush due to policies that broadened eligibility for the program and more aggressive efforts to get eligible Americans to apply for benefits. These policies remained in place under Obama.\nThe second is the 2007-09 recession, which drove the number of SNAP recipients to record highs. In an average month in 2011, one in seven U.S. residents got help.\nSo what does the trend line for food stamp usage under Obama look like? Here\u2019s a graph, drawn from Agriculture Department data:\n\nNote that the number of beneficiaries did rise -- but not nearly by two-and-a-half times, or 150 percent. At the outset of Obama\u2019s presidency, nearly 32 million people were receiving SNAP benefits. By May 2016, that number had risen to 43.5 million -- an increase of 36 percent.\n\n"}
{"label": "false", "claim": "John Boehner \"Forcing Americans off of their current health coverage and onto a government-run plan isn't the answer, but that's exactly what the Democrats' plan would do.\"", "evidence": "When Democratic Sen. Harry Reid announced this week that he was including a form of a public option in health care reform, Republicans didn't like it.\n\n\n\"Whether you call it a public option, an opt-out, a trigger, or a co-op, the fact is all of these proposals put us on the path to government-run health care,\" said Republican House leader John Boehner. \"Forcing Americans off of their current health coverage and onto a government-run plan isn't the answer, but that's exactly what the Democrats' plan would do.\"\n\n\nWe've been studying the health care reform proposals in both the House and the Senate for some time now. All the plans have rules that would prevent people from being \"forced\" off their current health coverage and into a government-run plan.\n\n\nWe asked Boehner's office for a response. Staffers sent us to a\n\nstudy by the Lewin Group\n\n, which predicts that 123 million people would be enrolled in a public plan three years after the exchange is opened. (The Lewin Group is respected by many health care analysts and operates with editorial independence, but it is a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, whose primary business is private health insurance.)\n\n\nHere's an outline of the general argument on how 123 million people could become enrolled in a public plan: The public option will be a health insurance plan backed by the U.S. government, so it will have access to unlimited taxpayer funds and have unsurpassed bargaining power with hospitals and doctors. It will be able to force providers to accept low payments, such as what Medicare, the government-run health program for seniors, pays. So the public option will be the cheapest insurance option available on the exchange. Employers will see this and decide to sign up all their workers for the public option. The private insurance industry will wither and die. A single-payer system is upon us.\n\n\nThe problem with this line of reasoning is that the Democratic proposals so far include rules specifically to stop this from happening. We'll take it point-by-point:\n\n\n\u2022 The public option is not to be supplemented with unlimited taxpayer funds. The House and Senate bills say the federal government can support its administrative expenses when it begins, but it will have to be self-sustaining with patient premiums.\n\n\n\u2022 It will not be able to force hospitals and doctors to accept Medicare rates. The details of how the public option will work are still being developed, but committees in the House and Senate have indicated the public option should have to negotiate rates with providers, not pay Medicare rates.\n\n\n\u2022 Most employers will not have access to the health care exchange. The Senate Finance Committee proposal is very clear on this point; only small businesses will have access to the exchange. The House proposal is a little less clear. In the third year, it gives a health commissioner the power to allow businesses into the exchange. But the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office seemed to think the exchange would continue to be restricted to smaller businesses. The CBO projected\n\nonly 30 million people\n\nwould be in the exchange by 2019, a number too small to imply that all employers would be given access.\n\n\n\u2022 Employers can't sign up their employees for a health care plan. The House and Senate proposals specifically forbid that. The employer can provide a set amount of money as a benefit, but the employee decides which plan to buy. If an employee is willing to pay more for a more generous plan, the employer can't stop him. And employers definitely can't force employees to enroll in the public option against their will.\n\n\nAn argument others have made along these same lines: If a public option is offered on the exchange, employers will dump their coverage and send them into the exchange to buy their own insurance. This is a largely speculative argument, however. Employers are under significant competitive pressure to offer health plans to recruit and retain workers, according to experts we've spoken with. Surveys show that workers see health insurance as the top benefit affecting their decisions on where they work. If there's evidence to indicate that the availability of a public option would overcome that dynamic, we haven't found it.\n\n\nThere's another argument specific to seniors that Boehner's staff pointed to as evidence for his statement. They said that under the Democratic plans, seniors in Medicare Advantage would have to switch to regular Medicare. We've looked at this argument before: Medicare Advantage is a government program that pays private insurance companies a set rate to treat Medicare beneficiaries. It was conceived as a cost-containment measure on the theory that competition among private plans would drive down costs. That has not happened. The health care proposals would stop the extra payments that Medicare Advantage receives. (About 23 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Medicare Advantage.)\n\n\nSo it is conceivable that some people in\n\nMedicare Advantage will lose some of their current benefits\n\n, and they might have to enroll in regular Medicare. But does this really fit the criteria of \"forcing Americans off of their current health coverage and onto a government-run plan\"? While private companies are contractors in the Medicare Advantage program \u2014 so it does have more of a free market element to it \u2014 at the end of the day, Medicare and Medicare Advantage are both government-run plans, where the government decides how much it will pay for a basic package of benefits.\n\n\nIn refuting this argument, we are not trying to imply that no one will ever have to switch plans if health care reform passes. Indeed, we looked at President Obama's statement, \"If you like your health care plan,\n\nyou can keep your health care plan\n\n,\" and rated it Half True, because health care reform will change many aspects of health care regulation, and it seems likely that will prompt insurers, employers and consumers to re-evaluate their health care plans and make changes. Obama later made a more accurate statement, that if you \"already have health insurance through your job, or Medicare, or Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to\n\nchange the coverage or the doctor you have\n\n.\" We rated that True.\n\n\nBut we've also found nothing in the proposals so far that would force people off their current coverage into a government-run plan, if they prefer and can pay for private coverage. Boehner said that was \"exactly what the Democrats' plan would do"}

PolitiFact Florida attempted to pull the permits on this one and find out what happened.\nCampaign development\nThe state GOP told PolitiFact the commercial stemmed from a plane ride Crist took from Gainesville to Tallahassee on July 25. While Scott uses his personal jet to attend events and has been criticized for a lack of transparency surrounding its use, Crist has often used private planes to help him get to events around the state. This time the Scott campaign took a photo of the 2005 Cessna 560XL\u2019s tail number and traced its ownership.\nThe owner turned out to be James Finch, a Lynn Haven contractor who owns Phoenix Construction Services Inc., a company previously fined for environmental infractions. That was especially problematic for the flight in question, since Crist was attending a climate change lecture by Florida State University oceanography professor Jeff Chanton.\nFinch, a former NASCAR team owner, has a long history of political donations, giving tens of thousands of dollars to the Republican Party of Florida and John McCain\u2019s presidential campaign. He also has a history of facing fines from the federal Environmental Protection Agency and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. While neither agency responded to PolitiFact Florida\u2019s requests for documentation of Finch\u2019s penalties, we were able to do a little digging on our own.\nOn two occasions, in 1984 and 1996, he was cited for backfilling the bayou at his home.

That will save you money. It will help the environment. We\u2019ve doubled our use of renewable energy, and thousands of Americans now have jobs building wind turbines and long-lasting batteries.\"\n\nThe line about renewable energy was identical to a line in Obama\u2019s acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C.\n\nWe wondered whether Obama was correct that we\u2019ve \"doubled our use of renewable energy.\"\n\nWe began by asking the Obama campaign to back up the claim. A spokeswoman cited three statistics from the Energy Information Administration, a federal agency that collects energy data.\n\n\u2022 Net electricity generation from wind, which more than doubled between 2008 and 2011.\n\n\u2022 Net electricity generation from solar has more than doubled over the same period.\n\n\u2022 During the first five months of 2012, the United States has produced more electricity from wind than it did in all of 2008.\n\nWe checked the data and found out that all of these comparisons are accurate. But that doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. The problem for Obama is not that the trend is inaccurate, but that he used the wrong words to describe it.\n\nSolar and wind are not the only types of renewables\n\nThe agency's tables include several additional categories of renewable energy, including hydroelectric, geothermal and various types of biomass energy. If you put them all together by BTUs, wind energy in 2011 accounted for 11 percent of all renewable-energy production. That\u2019s not 11 percent of all energy production, including coal, oil and natural gas \u00a0-- that\u2019s 11 percent of just the production from renewable sources. Solar, meanwhile, was even smaller. It accounted for about 1 percent of all renewable energy production.\n\nIf you look at all types of electricity generation from renewables, the increase isn\u2019t double between 2008 and 2011 -- it\u2019s 55 percent.\n\n\"Energy\" and \"electricity\" are not the same thing\n\nNot all renewable energy is used to create electricity. \u00a0For instance, some renewable energy is used for transportation, primarily ethanol in gasoline. This ethanol is counted in the \"energy\" category but not in the \"electricity\" category. Much smaller amounts of biomass are used for heating in colder locales or in industrial facilities like paper mills.\n\nSo, to use Obama\u2019s words, did renewable energy -- not just electricity -- double between 2008 and 2011? No. The increase in megawatt hours was about 25 percent, according to EIA data and estimates.\n\n\"Taken literally, the quoted statement is imprecise and probably misleading,\" said Joel Darmstadter, a senior fellow at Resources for the Future, an energy-policy think tank.\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn his two speeches, Obama said, \"We've doubled our use of renewable energy.\" But while the nation has made strides in expanding electricity generated by wind and solar -- the most high-profile part of the administration\u2019s policies -- the increase for all kinds of energy, and for all types of renewables, was about 25 percent"}

This is a problem that's been in the making for two decades. And now we're going to try to solve it in two weeks?\"\n\nIn fact, the state has been trying to solve the problem for several years. But we were interested in whether the state employee pension plan is destined to run dry in 16 years -- around the year 2027.\n\nWe asked Keefe for his source and he referred us to Raimondo's June 2011 report, \"Truth In Numbers: The Security and Sustainability of Rhode Island's Retirement System.\" On Page 9, it says a Boston College study said, \"Rhode Island's retirement plan for state employees and teachers could run completely out of assets between 2019 and 2023 (much sooner than most public plans in other states).\"\n\nThat's 8 to 12 years, not 16.\n\nTo explain the variation, we looked at the full Boston College study, \"Can State and Local Pensions Muddle Through?\" dated March 2011 and written by experts at the Center for Retirement Research.\n\nIt predicts that the pension fund will run dry, and all the money that current employees had paid into their retirement system would be lost, in:\n\n* 12 years (in 2023) if the system remained unchanged and the state's investments earned 8 percent;\n\n* 11 years (in 2022) if the state's investments earned 6 percent;\n\n* 8 years (in 2019) if the pension fund were frozen for existing employees and retirees, new workers were excluded and the rate of return was 6 percent.\n\nThe end could come a lot sooner. The actual annual rate of return during the last 10 years has been 2.28 percent after fees and administrative expenses.\n\nWe sent an e-mail asking Keefe why he said 16 years when the report he was citing said 8 to 12 years. He didn't respond.\n\nSo what would happen if the fund ran out of money?\n\nThe state is legally obligated to pay pension benefits. There would be no income from investments to cover those payments. The money contributed by current state employees would be used to pay retirees. The state would have to pay the rest out of the general revenue budget, so taxpayers would be funding retirees on a pay-as-you-go basis.\n\n"}

June 2009 is when economists believe the \"Great Recession\" ended.\n\nWas Perry right? We wanted to find out.\n\nPerry has based his candidacy -- in part -- on all the people working in Texas, saying policies like the state\u2019s lack of an income tax and his efforts to get out of the way of businesses are part of the reason for the job growth.\n\nIn June 2009, there were nearly 10.3 million Texans on payrolls, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. In August 2011, the most recent federal data available, slightly more than 10.6 million people were working in Texas. The increase was about 323,000 jobs.\n\nNationally, the number of additional Americans working increased by nearly 837,000 during that same time span. If you do the math, Texas accounts for 38.6 percent of that increase. Perry\u2019s camp calculates the increase at 39.2 percent. It came up with the same amount of new workers in Texas but said the job increase was 824,000.\n\nEither way you slice it, the percentage of additional workers in Texas in comparison to the rest of the nation is impressive. So what\u2019s going on in Texas?\n\nSome economic experts say Texas has some natural advantages, such as its oil, its ports and its proximity to Mexico. Thomas Saving, the director of Texas A&M University\u2019s Private Enterprise Research Center, noted several other factors -- such as it being a right-to-work state and having low debt -- that draw businesses to the state.\n\nSaving, who teaches at Perry\u2019s alma mater, said much of the job growth is in education and health care. The state\u2019s population is growing, which means it needs more teachers. Texas, he said, has more people on the Medicaid rolls because of that population growth, which requires more health care professionals.\n\nSaving noted that the governor\u2019s office in Texas does not have as much power as other states, so Perry should not get all the credit for the job growth. He also noted the simple factor of the additional people moving into the Lone Star State is another explanation for the job growth. That state\u2019s population grew by nearly 4.3 million people between 2000 and 2010, more than any other state, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. California was second, with a population increase of about 3.4 million. Texas is now third in U.S. population, behind California and New York.\n\nEconomist Doug Hall also pointed out the state\u2019s population growth and its unemployment rate, which has risen from 7.7 percent in June 2009 to its current rate of 8.5 percent.\n\n\"That\u2019s a pretty significant number that [Perry] doesn\u2019t mention,\" said Hall, director of the Economic Analysis & Research Network for the Washington-based Economic Policy Institute.\n\nOur friends at PolitiFact Texas tackled a similar topic when Perry boasted about the state\u2019s job creation during a GOP presidential debate. It noted that moderator Brian Williams pointed out that Texas has the highest-in-the-nation share of minimum-wage workers.\n\nPerry\u2019s numbers are on target, but there is some context to consider here.

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Mitt Romney College tuition \"costs have risen by 25 percent under the Democrats.\"", "evidence": "In a recent Spanish-language television ad, Mitt Romney criticizes President Barack Obama\u2019s record on higher education.\n\nA translation provided by the campaign has the narrator saying, \"Four years ago, Hispanics hoped Democrats would get an \u2018A\u2019 in improving our education. The reality is that more than 75 percent of the population thinks that college is not affordable. Tuition costs have increased 25 percent under Obama and the Democrats, and total student debt has reached a trillion dollars.\" After a clip of Obama saying he wants to be held accountable on education, the narrator continues in Spanish, \"When it comes to education, Obama and the Democrats have failed our kids.\"\n\nWe first checked with the Romney campaign, which said the figure came from the College Board, which produces an annual study of college costs.\n\nThe College Board found that for the school-year 2008-2009, the average published tuition and fees for in-state students at public four-year colleges and universities was $6,585. By the 2011-2012 school year, it stood at $8,244. That\u2019s an increase of slightly over 25 percent. So the claim has a grain of statistical truth.\n\nBut there are several other issues to consider.\n\nThe first one has to do with the translation. The exact words the narrator says are, \"Los costos han subido 25 por ciento por los Dem\u00f3cratas,\" while the screen says, \"25% costos de universidad,\" with a large arrow pointing upward. While it\u2019s clear that the ad is saying that \"costs have risen by 25 percent under the Democrats,\" it\u2019s less clear whether the \"costs\" in question are tuition alone or tuition plus room and board.\n\nThe distinction makes a difference. Tuition and fees plus room and board rose from $14,333 to $17,131 over the same period. That\u2019s just under a 20 percent increase, short of the 25 percent claimed in the ad.\n\nBecause of the uncertainty over the translation, we won\u2019t count this as a strike against the ad\u2019s accuracy. But other issues are more problematic:\n\n\u2022 The tuition figure is only for in-state students at public universities. The College Board also offered data for other types of schools, and each was smaller than 25 percent.\n\nHere's how much tuition and fees increased for other situations:\n\n* Public, four-year institutions -- up 19 percent.\n* Public, two-year colleges -- up 23 percent\n* Private, four-year institutions -- up 13 percent;\n* For-profit institutions -- up 11 percent.\n\nSo, the Romney campaign was cherry-picking by using the 25 percent figure.\n\n\u2022 The 25 percent figure doesn\u2019t adjust for inflation. The College Board data cited in the ad does not adjust for inflation. But Department of Education statistics do.\n\nAccording to the Education Department, inflation-adjusted costs (tuition, room and board) for all institutions were $17,257 in 2008-2009 and $18,133 in 2010-2011. That\u2019s a 5 percent increase over two years or, extrapolating out to 2011-2012, an increase of between 7 percent and 8 percent over the same time period that the ad is talking about. Certain sectors rose faster than others -- public, four-year institutions rose by 12 percent once you extrapolate out to the full period. But even this increase is well below 25 percent.\n\n\u2022 The ad uses \"published\" rates, not \"net costs.\" Universities\u2019 published rates are like the sticker prices on cars. They are the prices before they are offset by financial aid. To students and parents, it\u2019s actually the net cost that matters most.\n\nDue in part to financial aid programs and tax credits in Obama\u2019s economic stimulus package, the net cost for the average student at a private, four-year institution has actually declined since 2008-2009, from $13,620 to $12,970 -- a drop of 5 percent. At public, four-year institutions, in-state students saw the net price rise from $2,310 to $2,490, an increase of 8 percent -- less than the 25 percent jump cited in the ad.\n\n\u2022 Who gets the blame for rising college costs? The escalating cost of college is nothing new -- it\u2019s been going on for years. In fact, if you look at the trends in the inflation-adjusted Education Department data for all institutions, the rates of growth under Obama -- 2.2 percent and 2.7 percent in the years where data is available -- are lower than the rates of increase in six of the preceding eight years under President George W. Bush.\n\nOf course, the president of the United States doesn\u2019t set college prices. Who does? A combination of the marketplace, private universities and the state-government officials such as governors and legislatures who set state subsidies for public institutions. And with the Republicans controlling a significant majority of governorships and state legislatures since 2010, as well as a sizable minority of governorships and legislatures prior to 2010, the GOP bears some responsibility as well.\n\nAnd as we\u2019ve noted, the one area in which Obama had a degree of control over -- federal aid to students -- his actions have helped bring down the net cost of college.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe ad claims that \"costs have risen by 25 percent under the Democrats.\" It\u2019s true that the published costs for one type of college and one type of student have risen by 25 percent since Obama took office, but other data shows a smaller rise for tuition and fees, particularly when inflation is taken into account.\n\nEven for the college costs that have risen, the Romney campaign does not provide sufficient proof to link that rise to Obama. Governors and legislatures bear far more responsibility for rising prices at public universities, and to the extent Obama has had any effect, it has been to help slow or even decrease the cost burden through federal assistance to students"}

The bill\u2019s supporters are anxiously hoping the Georgia Senate will adopt the legislation. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\u2019s new Legislative Navigator gives it a 27 percent chance of passing this session.\nThe bill\u2019s primary sponsor, Rep.

Peake said he was persuaded to get involved after meeting a 4-year-old girl from his area named Haleigh Cox who suffers from a severe seizure disorder.\nPeake said he received the information he used to base his claim from the Realm of Caring, a Colorado-based organization that has attempted to provide care to patients suffering from cancer, AIDS, Parkinson\u2019s disease and other conditions through the use of medicinal cannabis oil. Some Georgians have moved to Colorado to seek treatment for their children. Peake clarified his statement, saying that it was actually 98 percent of patients who had diminished seizure activity.\nMarijuana contains about 60 chemical components called cannabinoids. The cannabinoid that the bill\u2019s proponents are considering is cannabidiol. It would be ingested and not smoked, the bill\u2019s supporters say. It would not include THC, which is the element in cannabis that causes smokers to get high.\nThe form of cannabidiol used at the Realm of Caring is named Charlotte\u2019s Web, after a 5-year-old girl whose recovery from a rare condition is credited to the substance. Charlotte\u2019s Web is a rich amber and as thick as cold honey. It smells like marijuana and tastes like raw plants. A month\u2019s supply of the oil can cost $150 to $250, and some families say they receive financial help from nonprofit groups.\nHeather Jackson, the executive director of the Realm of Caring Foundation, said Peake was correct that every patient studied in the first set of tests, \"harvests\" is the term she used, had a reduction in seizures. The Realm of Caring is in its second harvest and has seen less than a handful of nonresponders, which accounts for Peake\u2019s revised 98 percent total.\nThe New York Times, though, reported in December that there is \"scattered medical research\" to substantiate claims cannabis oils helped reduce seizures, citing a 2012 study on the American Epilepsy Society\u2019s website.

{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Cascade Policy Institute Unemployment among Oregon high school graduates aged 18 to 20 increased more than 200 percent from 2008 to 2011, while the U.S. average increased only 30 percent.", "evidence": "PolitiFact Oregon was easing into a new week, excited about the warm weather, when this tweet came over to shatter our calm: #Unemployment for #Oregon HS grads 18-20 jumps 300% compared to 30% nationally.\n\nIt was a tweet from the Cascade Policy Institute, a think tank in Portland that advocates limited government. A research associate there had written a post called \"Oregon\u2019s Minimum Wage Prices Teens Out.\" Here\u2019s a fuller explanation from the website:\n\n\"Oregon\u2019s unemployment among high school graduates aged 18 to 20 tops the national charts, with a rise of more than 300% from 2008 to 2011. This gigantic leap dwarfs the U.S. unemployment rate for the same demographic, which only shows an increase of around 30%.\" (Cascade later revised the claim to reflect a 200 percent increase.)\n\nHow could we find out if this was all true? Does Oregon top the national charts? Was the increase in Oregon really that much worse than the national increase? And what about the underlying point: That Oregon\u2019s minimum wage was to blame? The original post contained no links and -- more significantly -- no unemployment numbers, so we had little to go on. We put in a call to Cascade.\n\nA little background here for those unfamiliar with opposition to Oregon\u2019s minimum wage. Oregon has the second highest-minimum wage among states, $8.80 this year, second only to Washington, at $9.04. What really annoys critics is that the wage automatically goes up every Jan. 1, as it is indexed to inflation. Voters approved the automatic indexing in 2002. Restaurants and small businesses hate it and argue that a high minimum wage hurts teen employment.\n\nSo it makes sense that Cascade, which sides with free market principles, is among those critics. We spoke with Steve Buckstein, the group\u2019s senior policy analyst. In doing so, Buckstein corrected the original write-up to reflect a 219 percent increase, and not a 300 percent increase, in Oregon\u2019s 18-20 unemployment rate. He said the general argument still stands.\n\n\"We have a very high minimum wage, and it makes it harder for teens and unskilled workers to get jobs,\" Buckstein said.\n\nBasic starting point: What are his numbers and where did he get them? Cascade turned to the Employment Policies Institute, a business-backed Washington, D.C., group that also dislikes the minimum wage. The institute even runs a website called MinimumWage.com.\n\nMichael Saltsman, a research fellow there, used Current Population Survey figures (which are compiled by the U.S. Census and used by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics) to figure out unemployment for high school graduates 18 to 20.\n\nHere are the numbers: In 2008, unemployment in Oregon was 11.1 percent. By 2011, it was 35.4 percent. That is a 219 percent increase. The U.S average was 18.3 percent in 2008 and 24.5 percent in 2011. That is a 34 percent increase.\n\nWe were struck by two things in the data: The high 35 percent rate in Oregon in 2011, but also the low 11 percent rate in 2008. We were doing better than the national average five years ago. Obviously if we go from lower-than-average to higher-than-average, we\u2019re going to get a larger-than-usual increase. That made us see the 200 percent increase in a new light.\n\nWe then checked with the Oregon Center for Public Policy, another local think tank, but on the other side of the issue. Executive director Chuck Sheketoff suggested we try the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, which, unlike the Employment Policies Institute, supports raising the minimum wage.\n\nEconomic analyst David Cooper shared his unemployment rates for the same age group, also using Current Population Survey figures. And you know what we found? The unemployment figures were different -- lower, generally, all around -- but the rates of increase were about the same.\n\nIn 2008, unemployment for high school graduates 18-20 years old in Oregon was 8.3 percent, compared with 13.4 percent nationally. In 2011, Oregon unemployment had grown to 25.4 percent, compared with 18.4 percent nationally. Those figures correspond with a 206 percent increase in Oregon, and 37 percent nationally.\n\nAgain, Oregon was doing better than the national average, before we did worse in 2011.\n\n(Cooper also argues youth unemployment jumped dramatically \"across the entire country, and particularly in the Pacific Northwest\" between 2008 and 2011. The increase in Washington was 85 percent and in Idaho, 83 percent. Again, Oregon had lower unemployment than both states in 2008 but ended with slightly higher rates in 2011, which made the increase more dramatic.)\n\nWe checked with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which provides the official unemployment figures, and Oregon\u2019s Employment Department. We\u2019ll spare you more numbers. Both agencies showed the same trend, albeit for slightly different age groups, education levels and years.\n\nClearly, the numbers went up. Is any of this tied to Oregon\u2019s indexed minimum wage? People disagree on this. Obviously when employers are shedding jobs, they\u2019re not hiring. And when they do start hiring, they often hire more experienced adults. There\u2019s no question the recession has hit teens and other young workers hard.\n\nBut Nick Beleiciks, state employment economist, offers a different take on how unemployment intersects with a high minimum wage. Data show that teens in Oregon are more likely to look for work than teens across the country, he said. That\u2019s called a participation rate.\n\n\"Oregon has a higher participation rate and that could have to do with the higher minimum wage and because of that higher participation rate, we do have a higher unemployment rate among teenagers,\" he said.\n\nBuckstein argues that the high unemployment rate has to do with younger workers looking for jobs in a limited market, and not getting those jobs because they\u2019re losing out to more experienced workers. Of course, neither explanation addresses why our rates were lower than the U.S. average in 2008, which was after Oregon voters approved indexing the minimum wage to inflation in 2002.\n\nWe won\u2019t rule on that argument. We\u2019re sticking to the numbers. In case you\u2019ve forgotten them, here\u2019s a nifty table for easy review:\n\n"}

In an October 2011 report, the center said that in five states where photo ID laws were scheduled to take effect in 2012, some 3.2 million Americans, accounting for about 10 percent of the states\u2019 voting-age residents, lacked government-issued photo IDs.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nTwo of those states -- Texas and South Carolina -- must have their laws cleared by the U.S. Department of Justice because of past failures to protect minority voting rights. The department rejected South Carolina\u2019s law in December 2011 (saying that minority registered voters were more likely than whites to lack state IDs) and declined to bless the Texas law in March 2012.\n\nThe Texas law would require voters to show a valid government-issued photo ID, such as a Texas driver's license, Department of Public Safety identification card, state concealed handgun license, U.S. military ID or U.S. passport.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBack to the nationwide data: The center\u2019s 2006 survey reached by telephone 987 U.S. citizens of voting age, asking them questions including, \"Do you have a current, unexpired government-issued ID with your picture on it, like a driver\u2019s license or a military ID?\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAs voter ID debates heated up in 2011, the conservative Heritage Foundation issued a critique of the survey, noting it was still frequently cited and questioning its decision not to focus on registered or actual voters.

Among African Americans, 25 percent did not have such ID, compared to 8 percent of whites. Not enough Hispanics were surveyed to reach reliable conclusions about that subgroup, the center said.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIn a December 2011 report, the NAACP mentioned the 25-percent figure from the 2006 survey, going on to say that factors in individuals not having IDs may include the cost of getting a photo ID (because minorities are over-represented in the poor population) or a lack of the documents needed to apply for the photo ID, such as birth certificates (not issued to many African Americans born before the Civil Rights Act passed), which also can cost money to obtain.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen we looked into the Democrats\u2019 claim, we found no other national surveys by race of which U.S. citizens eligible to vote have government-issued photo IDs.

In a statement to the New York Post which published a piece on the blog, Hoadley\u2019s campaign said the posts were \"bad college poetry.\" In a Facebook video released Aug. 10, Hoadley issued an apology: \"I said things 16 years ago that I would never say today that aren\u2019t reflective of who I am, and so for folks that I hurt with my words, I\u2019m sorry.\"\nHoadley is 37 years-old and the first openly LGBTQ person to run for Congress in Michigan. The LGBTQ Victory Fund, a national organization dedicated to electing LGBTQ candidates, accused CLF of using harmful tropes about gay men. CLF press secretary Will Reinert defended the ad in an email, reiterating its claim that the blog shows lack of judgment.\nA closer look at each of the ad\u2019s claims in context showed that CLF\u2019s ad is inaccurate and misleading.\n\"Hoadley called women \u2018breeders.\u2019 That\u2019s sexist.\"\nIn a blog entry dated Jun. 20, 2005, when Hoadley was 21 years-old and had just completed his junior year in college, Hoadley recapped a weekend in D.C., including going out to straight bars with two friends. \"Glad I went\u2026but my straight fix has been satisfied for a while. I\u2019m not going to lie: breeder=weird/bad dancers. Disagree if you want\u2014you\u2019re just deluding yourself,\" Hoadley wrote. According to Urban Dictionary, a \"breeder\" is a derogatory term to describe straight people. The term can refer to either straight men or straight women. The term is contemptuous, but it\u2019s not sexist and Hoadley wasn\u2019t using it to describe straight women exclusively.\n\n"}

Yes, we could get rid of (Syrian dictator Bashar) Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS. So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy. But before you do that, you've got to think about what happens the day after.\"\nClinton shot back, \"With all due respect, senator, you voted for regime change with respect to Libya.

The uprising -- part of the Arab Spring -- toppled Gaddafi in August 2011, and rebel forces killed him the following October.\nCongress never voted to authorize U.S. military action in Libya, so what is Clinton talking about?\nOn March 1, 2011, the Senate approved a resolution \"strongly condemning the gross and systematic violations of human rights in Libya.\"\nThe Senate approved the resolution by unanimous consent, so senators never actually voted on it. But Sanders showed his support by joining in as one of 10 cosponsors.\nThe resolution called for peaceful regime change, saying Gaddafi should \"desist from further violence, recognize the Libyan people\u2019s demand for democratic change, resign his position and permit a peaceful transition to democracy.\"\nA Senate resolution carries very little weight. It has no legal teeth and is more like a statement expressing the general \"sense of Congress,\" said Joshua Huder, senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University.\n\n"}

We decided to check.\nMay directed us to DeKalb Workforce Development, the local agency that provides \"one-stop\" education, training and employment programs under the federal Workforce Investment Act.\nThe agency keeps track of jobs in several categories, said Workforce Director Sheryl Stone. \u00a0They are:\n\n\nGeographic Solutions: A statewide database that counts only full-time employees hired or retained through federal Department of Labor funds. In 2014, DeKalb saw 731 new hires in this category and 602 people who retained new jobs for at least a year. Total: 1,333.\n\n\nCapital Improvement Plan (CIP): \u00a0A count of workers hired or retained, either part-time or full-time, as part of DeKalb\u2019s $1.35 billion overhaul of its water/sewer system. Last year, 107 people were hired and 386 saw jobs retained as part of working for contractors on the program. Total: 493.\n\n\nTaleo: Employers who work on the county level to recruit for part-time and full-time jobs use DeKalb\u2019s Taleo system to filter resumes. Some workers will transfer to the state Geographic Solutions system once they have completed probationary periods for full-time work. The county does not break out the number of jobs based on full-time or part-time in this category, but all are unsubsidized with government dollars. Total: 348.\n\n\nJob training: Workforce uses federal dollars to subsidize up to half of a new hire\u2019s salary for 90 days. The employer recruits through the agency and must hire the employee at full time with benefits. The subsidy is designed to serve as a training cost. Total: 167.\n\n\nStone said the agency determined that, over a 10-year period, the average salary for workers it helped find employment was $56,000.\n\"We really are making a difference,\" she said.\nAnd, adding up the categories, Workforce counts 2,341 people working for the year.\nThat would fully support May\u2019s claim, except for hiccups with the counts themselves.\nThe local Taleo category, for instance, counts part-time jobs as equal to those with full-time hours (which the county considers after only 32 hours). Job seekers are apt to view even 32 hours per week to be part-time, suggesting that category is inflated, according to experts.\nThe bigger question is how Workforce is counting workers in the water/sewer overhaul. Stone said the agency counts workers as reported by the contractors selected for different projects.\nSome of those people may work only a few days or months on a specific task, Stone said, but they are included in the total headcount reported.\n\n"}

Jerry Brown signed SB 350, a landmark climate change package authored by the senator.\nThe current legislation requires 50 percent of California\u2019s electricity come from renewable energy sources by 2030. That\u2019s up from an earlier mandate calling for 33 percent of the state\u2019s energy to come from renewable sources by 2020.\nCurrently, California gets about a quarter of its energy from renewables, thanks to the huge solar and wind farms that have popped up in places like the Mojave Desert in recent years. The bill by the Los Angeles Democrat also calls on the state to double the energy efficiency of its buildings by 2030.\n\"Senate Bill 350 puts us on track to generate half, half of our electricity from renewable sources. And double the energy efficiency of all of our buildings by 2030. No city in the state, no state in this nation, for that matter the entire world, has adopted targets more ambitious in scale,\" De Le\u00f3n said in a speech at the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles.\nWe decided to fact-check De Le\u00f3n\u2019s claim that no one else has more ambitious clean energy targets than California, with a focus on renewable energy.\n\nOur research\nAt first glance, the senator\u2019s statement seemed headed for a \"False\" rating or even \"Pants on Fire!\" That\u2019s because some countries, as well as other U.S. states, and even some cities in California have more aggressive renewable energy goals, at least on a percentage basis. San Francisco\u2019s goal, for example, is to meet 100 percent of its electricity demand with renewable power by 2020 \u2014 a decade before California wants to get half of its electricity from renewables.\nHawaii\u2019s target is 100 percent renewable energy use by 2045. Vermont\u2019s is 75 percent renewable use by 2032. The percentage threshold is higher for both states but further out than California\u2019s.\nInternationally, Norway has a goal to produce 67.5 percent of its energy from renewables by 2020, which would be a higher rate and earlier timeframe than California\u2019s goal.\nBut looking at De Le\u00f3n\u2019s statement closely, he qualifies it by saying California\u2019s clean energy goals are the most ambitious \"in scale.\" His office clarified that the senator was referencing California\u2019s large population size, and its potential to consume and produce more clean energy compared with other states and even some countries.\nCalifornia used 261.5 million megawatt hours of electricity two years ago. That was 27 times the amount used in Hawaii that year, and also far more than Vermont or even Norway. Considering that disparity, some clean energy experts said California does have the most ambitious goals, at least nationally.\n\n"}
{"label": "pants-fire", "claim": "Crossroads GPS \"Unions don\u2019t have to comply with Obamacare.\"", "evidence": "An ad from the Republican controlled campaign group Crossroads GPS asserts that unions are exempt from the new health care law as a political favor from President Barack Obama.\n\nThe ad shows union leaders and Obama speaking in favor of health care reform, then shows a Fox News anchor asking, \"Is the Obama administration exempting some from complying with the new health care law as a political favor?\"\n\nVideo shows Obama at a political rally, shouting, \"Because we fought together, we had worked together, they walked doors (door-to-door) for me, they made phone calls for me, they turned out the vote for me.\"\n\nText on the screen then says, \"Over 185 union waivers. All exempt from Obamacare mandate. If unions don\u2019t have to comply with Obamacare, why should we?\"\n\nWe spent a good bit of time looking into this claim, because it\u2019s based on some very wonky details of the new health care law, things like annual benefit limits, phase-ins to 2014 and rules advertised in the Federal Register. We\u2019re going to explain all those details momentarily, but we\u2019ll start by giving you the bottom line: Unions do have to obey the mandates of the health care law like any other organization. And if there\u2019s concrete evidence that they\u2019re getting special treatment, we didn\u2019t find it.\n\nFor simplicity\u2019s sake, we\u2019re going to start at the very beginning, before the passage of the health care law.\n\nInsurance limits and the new law\n\nPrior to passage of the health care law, insurance companies could place limits on what they would be willing to pay for a person\u2019s health care per year. A typical annual limit for someone with pretty good insurance might be $1 million, but it could be lower, sometimes much lower.\n\nIf you were never sick, you might not be aware that the limit existed. But it would be a different story if you were sick, particularly if you suffered from something that was expensive to treat, like cancer. One in 10 cancer patients, for example, exhaust benefit limits and have to find more insurance or pay for treatment themselves, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\nLow-wage workers were particularly vulnerable to plans with low annual limits. In some cases, annual payouts would be as low as $2,000. Those types of plans are often called \"mini-meds,\" and consumer advocates say they\u2019re almost always a bad deal.\n\nThe health care law phases out annual benefit limits so that people wouldn\u2019t be caught without coverage, according to the HHS. The phase-out started this year, with new rules saying that all insurance plans must offer at least $750,000 in payouts per year. The number goes up every year so that by 2014 no caps at all will be allowed.\n\nLast year, though, companies started complaining, saying that if they had to meet the new requirements, they would either have to increase premiums paid by their employees or end coverage altogether. The Obama administration didn\u2019t want that to happen, so they started granting waivers to the new rule. The waivers would be granted to health plans annually until 2014, according to the HHS, when people will be able to buy standard health insurance policies using new state-based \"exchanges.\" That same year, low-wage workers will be eligible for tax credits to help them buy insurance.\n\n\"It is essential that we make sure that Americans who have insurance today \u2013 even if that\u00a0insurance is highly limited \u2013 can keep that coverage until reforms take effect that will increase\u00a0their ability to choose among comprehensive, affordable insurance options in 2014,\" said Steven Larsen, who oversees the waiver process, in testimony before Congress in March.\n\nSo far, employers like McDonald\u2019s, Jack in the Box, Cracker Barrel and O\u2019Reilly Auto Parts have successfully applied for waivers for their health plans. Other approved applicants include Sunview Vineyards of California, Securitas Security Services USA, Mesa Air Group and Dish Network. (See all the approved applications here.) There are also several union health plans, which are the basis for the claims in the Crossroads ad.\n\nWe contacted the HHS and asked for the number of waivers they\u2019ve granted so far. A spokeswoman told us that they have approved 1,372 applications and denied 92. Of the approved applications, 27 represent unions and another 315 represent plans jointly managed by unions and employers. Even if you took the broadest definition possible, counting all the joint plans as union plans, only 25 percent of the waivers have gone to unions. The rest have gone to plans offered by employers, insurance companies and other non-union groups.\n\nTo be clear, though, the waivers do not exempt these groups from the health care law. They only allow them to continue offering their current health plans with annual limits until 2014.\n\nWe should note that some Republicans are\u00a0firm in their opposition to the waivers. Two congressional hearings have been held on why waivers are being offered and if the process is transparent. A law firm for Crossroads GPS has filed a federal lawsuit against HHS, claiming that the agency has not responded quickly enough to its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for information about how the waivers are being awarded. The lawsuit says it's seeking \"the criteria to be applied by HHS in deciding whether to grant or deny applications for waiver of the annual limit requirements.\"\u00a0\n\n"}

Iran can have a reduced number of operating centrifuges for 10 years, but research and development on advanced centrifuges will be limited. Uranium enrichment is supposed to be kept at levels unsuitable for weapons use for the next 15 years. Iran also can no longer produce plutonium, the other element that could create a bomb. \u00a0\n\n"}

Don Balfour, a Gwinnett County Republican, objecting to Senate Bill 469, which would fine people and groups who conduct mass protests at someone\u2019s home and cause a ruckus. Sheriff\u2019s deputies would occasionally be involved in stopping these protests.\n\nHere\u2019s part of Jackson\u2019s objection to the bill: \"The role of law enforcement shouldn\u2019t be to police free speech but the intent of this bill seems to be just that.

Working daily throughout the communities of Fulton County gives me the opportunity to interact with varied segments of the population and see firsthand how citizens are suffering under the sluggish economy. Our state has an unemployment rate close to 10%, which is higher than the national average, while ranking last in job growth.\"\n\nWe\u2019ve fact-checked claims about Georgia\u2019s high unemployment rate before. But PolitiFact Georgia wondered about the final passage of that paragraph: is Georgia last in job growth? \u00a0\n\nMost economist measure job growth in a state by using U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data from one period and comparing it against another period. PolitiFact Georgia decided to measure the most recent 12-month period.\n\nIn December 2011, the most recent month available when Jackson wrote his letter, an estimated 3,809,800 Georgians were employed. In December 2010, approximately 3,823,700 Georgians had jobs. That\u2019s a decline of nearly 14,000 jobs during that time period.\n\nOnly four states had a decline during that time period: Alaska, Delaware, Georgia and Missouri. Georgia had the largest decline.\n\nSo far, so good for the accuracy of Sheriff Jackson\u2019s claim.\n\nThe five states with the greatest increase were, in order, California, Texas, Florida, New York and Ohio.\n\nWait! Those states are also some of the highest-populated in the country. Is the number of job losses the only way we should be measuring this? Georgia has a higher population than the three other states with job losses. Maybe that\u2019s why the Peach State had more job losses than any other state.\n\nWe decided to do some more math to look at the percentage of job growth or decline in each state. In Georgia, the decrease was 0.36 percent. Delaware, at 0.68 percent, and Alaska, at 0.52 percent had a greater decline.\n\nThe Atlanta-based Georgia Budget & Policy Institute recently put together a fact-sheet on how Georgia fares nationally in job growth. Like us, they measured the percentage change in job growth.\n\n\"That way, you are counting for the difference in sizes (of each state),\" said Alan Essig, the institute\u2019s director.\n\nSince the official end of the Great Recession (June 2009), Georgia ranked 49th out of the 50 states and Washington, D.C. in job growth, the institute found. Only Missouri and Nevada had a larger percentage decline in job growth, they found. The institute also looked at the same time period we did and came up with the same numbers, concluding that Alaska and Delaware ranked lower in job growth.\n\nEssig also told us that since December 2007, the only states with a greater percentage decline in job growth were Arizona, Florida and Nevada.\n\nJackson\u2019s office presented us an Atlanta Business Chronicle article that found Georgia was second to last in job creation between July 2010 and July 2011, saved from being dead last by Indiana. The article focused on the decline in jobs, not the percentage change. The sheriff\u2019s spokeswoman, Tracy Flanagan, also sent us a November 2011 report that showed Georgia had the largest percentage decline in employed workers in any state between June 2009 and September 2011, which was just over 2 percent.\n\nGeorgia does not look good here, any way you examine these numbers.\n\nGeorgia did have a larger decline in jobs than any other state over the most recent 12 months available.

Previously, California residents could\u00a0deduct the amount they pay in state and local taxes from their federal tax bill. As part of the 2017 tax bill, deductions will be capped at $10,000. The provision is set to end after 2025.\nAbout 6.1 million Californians filed for the deduction in 2015, reducing their federal tax income by an average of $18,438, according to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent group that models the effects of tax legislation.\nA report prepared by the Government Finance Officers Association, a group made up of government finance officers, shows similar numbers. The average deduction in California, New York and New Jersey are all over $17,000. If the state and local tax deduction were eliminated, \"an average taxpayer in New York who currently itemizes SALT (state and local tax) would face a tax increase of almost $5,500.\" \u00a0\nThat figure wouldn\u2019t be far off for a decent chunk of Californians.\n\n"}

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Johnny Isakson The \"Democrat majority in the Senate has failed to submit [a] budget in the past 1,000 days.\"", "evidence": "A favorite GOP talking point accusing Democrats of punting on the nation\u2019s budget problems for the past 1,000 days has made its way to Georgia.\n\nThe GOP devoted an entire video ad to it. U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, the Republican from Wisconsin who has won kudos from some deficit hawks, is churning out essays and press releases on it.\n\nAnd Georgia\u2019s U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, a Republican, is putting his own spin on the subject. \u00a0\n\n\"I find it very troubling that the president is asking to increase the nation\u2019s debt limit when his Democrat majority in the Senate has failed to submit [a] budget in the past 1,000 days,\" Isakson said in a Jan. 26 press release.\n\nThat\u2019s about three years.\n\nWe grabbed our calculator and got to work with the help of our sister sites PolitiFact Florida and PolitiFact Wisconsin, who have analyzed other claims on the same subject.\n\nBut before we proceed with our fact check, it helps to explain how Congress comes up with its federal budget.\n\nThis is how it works: Since the passage of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Senate and the House are supposed to pass budget resolutions in the spring. These budget resolutions set a framework for spending, taxation and other fiscal items in the coming fiscal year. They also lay out general plans for the next four years.\n\nIf these budget resolutions differ, the chambers are supposed to hammer out a compromise.\n\nIf a budget resolution doesn\u2019t pass, the federal government won\u2019t go dark.\n\nBudget resolutions are distinct from appropriations bills, which actually allocate how the federal government spends its money. \u00a0If a resolution tanks, the majority party can use congressional procedures to move forward to consider appropriations bills.\n\nAs a previous PolitiFact National story said, \"the inability to pass the budget framework can reflect poorly on the majority's organizational skills and/or the degree of partisan discord in Congress. It also increases the likelihood of a logjam of appropriations bills in the fall and winter, and decreases the chance that controversial tax bills will pass the Senate.\"\n\nNow, on to our fact check. Thanks to PolitiFact Florida and PolitiFact Wisconsin, we have a good sense of whether Isakson\u2019s claim is accurate.\n\nLast year, George LeMieux, a Republican contender for U.S. Senate in Florida, posted on Twitter that it had been 750 days since his opponent and Senate Democrats \"passed\" a budget.\n\nLeMieux was referring to the last time the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats, passed a budget resolution.\n\nIndeed, the last time the Senate passed a budget resolution was in 2009 for the 2010 fiscal year, according to a report on the budget process by the Congressional Research Service.\n\nPolitiFact Florida rated this statement Half True. The candidate got the number of days right, but placing the blame on Senate Democrats wasn\u2019t fair. Partisans on both sides share responsibility.\n\nLet\u2019s move on to Jan. 23, about 250 days after LeMieux made his statement. Ryan, the Republican House member from Wisconsin, said Senate Democrats \"have gone without any budget at all\" for more than 1,000 days.\n\nRyan\u2019s language could have been more precise, PolitiFact Wisconsin ruled. It had been that long since a budget resolution passed, but not since the last Senate budget resolution expired. He earned a Mostly True.\n\nIsakson uses somewhat different wording from Ryan and LeMieux. He said that the Democratic majority in the Senate has failed to \"submit\" -- not pass -- a budget in the past 1,000 days.\n\nDemocrats did submit a budget resolution since the last resolution passed, though it never went before the full Senate for a vote. \u00a0\n\nWe took a look at the Congressional Record, the official record of Congress\u2019 proceedings.\n\nOn April 26, 2010, under the heading \"Submitted Resolutions,\" is S. Con. Res. 60, introduced by Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota. He\u2019s a Democrat and head of the Senate Budget Committee.\n\nThe resolution would have set forth the budget for 2011, but the Senate took no action after its date of submission. \u00a0\n\nA resolution is \"submitted\" when its author formally presents it to the house of which he or she is a member, according to Congressional Quarterly\u2019s American Congressional Dictionary, a widely used authority on language used in Congress. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nInstead of passing a typical budget resolution for 2011, Democrats passed one that would last for a single year. They said that they were waiting for a fiscal commission created by President Barack Obama to make its recommendations for debt reduction, according to news accounts at the time.\n\nIn an email, Isakson spokeswoman Lauren Culbertson described Conrad\u2019s submission of the budget resolution as a \"gimmick.\"\n\n\"It was never reported out of committee. It was never brought to the floor. It was not debated for even one hour,\" the email said.\n\nFederal law limits debate on a budget resolution to 50 hours.\n\nThe Democrat-controlled Senate didn\u2019t put a budget resolution up for a vote last year. And according to news accounts, they don\u2019t intend to put one up this year, either.\n\nIsakson\u2019s claim that the \"Democrat majority in the Senate has failed to submit [a] budget in the past 1,000 days\" needs some revision.\n\nNo budget has been passed in the Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate. None has been put up for a vote in that time, either. But one was submitted April 26, 2010, or 640 days before Isakson issued his press release.\n\nThat said, this flaw in Isakson\u2019s statement doesn\u2019t undermine his larger point. The budget resolution for 2011 languished. It never went up for a vote, and Democrats haven\u2019t submitted one since. In the past few years, Senate Democrats have taken limited action on budget resolutions.\n\nThe statement contains a kernel of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression"}
{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Kendrick Meek \"The first time he ever voted as a Democrat was here in Florida in 2008. He only voted four times in his life, and he's asking Floridians to come out and vote for him.\"", "evidence": "Congressman Kendrick Meek wants voters to view him as the true Democrat in his U.S. Senate primary against billionaire Jeff Greene. In a June 22, 2010, debate between the two candidates hosted by the Palm Beach Post, Meek said of his opponent:\"The first time he ever voted as a Democrat was here in Florida in 2008. He only voted four times in his life, and he's asking Floridians to come out and vote for him.\"Greene's run as a Republican in 1982 in a Congressional primary in California isn't in dispute. And the Truth-o-Meter previously ruled a separate claim by Meek that Greene had only lived in Florida for two years as True. But we wondered, did Meek accurately summarize Greene's voting record -- is it true that the 55-year-old Greene has voted only four times in his life?We did our homework, checking voting records to determine how many times -- and under which party affiliation -- Greene voted.First we contacted the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk to ask for a history of Greene's voter registration and record. Greene registered as a Republican with an address in the city of Los Angeles in 1982, said spokeswoman Monica Flores in an e-mail. In 1992, he re-registered with an address in Malibu and changed party affiliation to \"Decline to State.\" Flores provided copies\u00a0of his 1982 and 1992 registrations. He voted in the 1992 general election, 2000 primary and general elections and the 2004 general election, Flores wrote. That's four elections in California, and Greene campaign spokesman Paul Blank says Greene voted for Democrats -- Bill Clinton, Al Gore and John Kerry -- in those presidential races. Another Greene spokesman Luis Vizcaino said Greene also voted in the 1982 Congressional primary, which he lost, but Flores said her office's voting history information only extends back to 1992.We contacted Miami-Dade County Supervisor of Elections.\u00a0Christina White, director of the office of governmental affairs, told us in an e-mail that Greene registered as a Democrat in Miami Beach on\u00a0March 20, 2008. He voted Nov. 4, 2008.We contacted Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher to ask when Greene registered in the county where he now lives. On April 14, 2010, he changed his address to Palm Beach, Bucher said. Bucher said Greene had previously registered to vote as an NPA (No Party Affiliation) in 1977 at Century Village in West Palm Beach. The office does not have any record of him voting affiliated with that registration.Vizcaino told us that the only county that Greene registered in in California was Los Angeles County and that the only other state he registered in was Florida. We e-mailed our findings to Vizcaino who disagreed with one part regarding registration: Greene says he registered in West Palm Beach in 1973 as a Democrat -- though Bucher said he registered in 1977 as an NPA. Vizcaino asked Greene about the discrepancy. Vizcaino said Greene replied: \"If that's what they have, I must have changed it at some point. I don't know why. I am certain I was a registered Democrat.\"The Greene campaign sent us this response to our query about his voting history and registration: \"Jeff voted in some elections and missed some elections, voting in 4 out of the last 5 presidential elections. Jeff is an outsider and wasn't focused on politics, he was focused on building a successful business and creating jobs.\"So where does that leave us?Meek said\u00a0that the first time Greene voted as a Democrat was in Florida in 2008. Based on voter history information we found in California and Florida dating back to 1992, that's true. Meek also claimed that Greene \"only voted four times in his life.\" We found five times: 1992, twice in 2000 and 2004 in California and once in Florida in 2008. Greene's campaign said he voted in 1982 when he ran for office. We think it would be strange if he ran for Congress and didn't vote for himself, but Los Angeles did not keep such records before 1992. Greene says he first registered as a Democrat in 1973 -- but Palm Beach records show 1977 as an NPA.\n\n"}

Bill Nelson spoke with a Central Florida news station to help explain the issue \u2014 and now viewers question his accuracy.\n\nAnchor Ybeth Bruzual had asked Nelson, a Democrat, about mandatory budget cuts set to go into effect March 1: \"How did we get to this point?\"\n\nHere\u2019s what he told viewers of Central Florida News 13, a partner of PolitiFact Florida:\n\n\"Well, a year and a half ago, when the country, in order to pay its bills, (and we) had to raise the artificial statutory debt ceiling so the country could pay its bills, a deal was struck: a trillion dollars of cuts went into effect immediately, and then a special committee was set up. They were to get agreement on another $3 trillion of cuts.\n\n\"Hanging over their head was a meat cleaver called the sequester, that was going to be, across the board, over a trillion dollars of additional cuts, but without a scalpel \u2014 a meat cleaver. Nobody ever expected the sequester to go into effect. It was never supposed to. It was the onerous alternative that would force the super-committee to come to agreement.\"\n\nNelson\u2019s right that the sequester\u2019s across-the-board cuts don\u2019t allow for much fine distinction.\n\nBut was Nelson correct that the 2011 budget deal included \"a trillion dollars of cuts went into effect immediately, and then a special committee was set up ... to get agreement on another $3 trillion of cuts\"?\n\n Budget Control Act of 2011\n\nSome viewers argued the cuts Nelson described as going into effect \"immediately\" were limits on future growth, hardly immediate.\n\nHere\u2019s the deal: In summer 2011, the federal government was reaching its legal debt limit, which meant Congress had to authorize a higher level for borrowing to cover its spending. House Republicans insisted that spending cuts go along with an increase to the debt limit. After rancorous debate, lawmakers passed the Budget Control Act of 2011.\n\nThe law set up caps on future discretionary spending that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would reduce spending by about a trillion dollars between 2012 and 2021, compared with what it would have been if annual appropriations grew at the rate of inflation.\n\nThe cuts weren\u2019t specified, but would be carried out by lawmakers during the annual appropriations process, with a trigger for across-the-board cuts if they busted the caps. (There were exceptions for certain kinds of spending, such as for war or disasters.)\n\nThat\u2019s not exactly the same as \"a trillion dollars of cuts went into effect immediately.\"\n\nThe law also established a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, the \"special committee\" that Nelson mentioned. The Budget Control Act required a 12-member panel, half from each party, to suggest legislation to reduce the deficit by at least $1.2 trillion over 10 years.\n\nIf that process failed \u2014 and it did \u2014 the law required the sequester. That\u2019s what happens March 1 if Washington does nothing.\n\nNelson said \"$3 trillion of cuts\" -- not $1.2 trillion.\n\nHis press secretary, Ryan Brown, noted \"there was no specific amount the committee had to cut in the legislation, or a limit to how much they could cut.\"\n\nThat\u2019s true if you mean cuts in spending, rather than cuts in the deficit \u2014 the law required the committee to achieve at least $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction, not necessarily spending cuts. Raising taxes would also reduce the deficit.\n\nBrown explained that Nelson had hoped the committee \"would do another $1.5 trillion to $3 trillion in deficit reduction.\"\n\nBut that\u2019s not what Nelson said. He told TV viewers the committee was set up \"to get agreement on another $3 trillion of cuts,\" as though that were part of the deal reached by lawmakers in the Budget Control Act.\n\nThere was a $3 trillion proposal floating around at the time. It was a deal offered to the deficit reduction committee in October 2011 by congressional Democrats.\n\nEven that proposal, as it was described in news accounts, didn\u2019t include $3 trillion in spending cuts,\u00a0 Rather, it was a package that included cuts, tax increases and new spending that would have trimmed $3 trillion from federal deficits over a decade.\n\nRepublican House Speaker John Boehner rejected the offer.\n\n Our ruling\n\nNelson said the 2011 budget deal included \"a trillion dollars of cuts went into effect immediately, and then a special committee ... to get agreement on another $3 trillion of cuts.\"\n\nNelson missed some things here.\n\n"}

According to the most recent data, from July 31, 2013, the city has only 31.4 percent of the money it needs to pay for its pension obligations.\nDuring the Sept. 21 edition of WPRI-TV's \"Newsmakers\" program, which featured Cianci rattling off a blizzard of financial numbers about the city, host Tim White asked Cianci about his role in the pension shortfall. After playing an old video in which Cianci stressed the importance of fully paying the city's pension costs, White noted that from 1998 to 2002, the city was putting in only 60 percent or less of what it was supposed to be paying.\nCianci said that he did pay in full, and he had a document to prove it.\n\"In 2001 and '02, a letter that I have from the finance director says that we had the pension system funded at [the] 100 percent level in that year, and we did for two years at that point,\" he said. Cianci made it clear later in the interview that he was referring to the two years prior to his leaving office.\nSo was the Cianci administration putting all of the money it was supposed to into the pension fund in those two years?\nThe short answer is no.\nCity pension records show that in the 2001 fiscal year, the city paid only 60.6 percent of the amount it needed to properly fund its pension program. That amount is an estimate known as the annual required contribution, or ARC.\nAnd in 2002, another year when Cianci said the pension was being funded at 100 percent, the funding level was actually 64.2 percent.\nOnly in the 2003 fiscal year, when Cianci was mayor for just over two months (to be succeeded by John Lombardi and, later, David Cicilline, now a U.S. representative) did the ratio rise significantly, to 80.3 percent.\nBy then, the pension fund was hobbled with a massive debt, with only $335 million of the $899 million it needed.\nAnd what about the letter Cianci was talking about?\nFirst, a little background.\nFrom 1991 through the 1994 fiscal year, and again in the 1996 fiscal year, Providence was paying 100 percent of the ARC. (Cianci, who had been mayor from 1975 until 1984 when he was removed from office after being convicted of felony assault, began his second stint as mayor in 1991.)\nBut after the first few years of Cianci's second administration, the funding for Providence's pension program began a precipitous decline. The city paid 54 percent in 1995, then 93.6 percent in 1997, 57.5 percent in 1998, 56.2 in 1999, 60.0 percent in 2000.\n\n"}

The deadlines were clear -- yet [he intentionally] missed them by months\" until after the November 2010 election.", "evidence": "Republican Brendan Doherty wasted no time coming out of the starting gate for the general election race with Democratic U.S. Rep. David Cicilline for the 1st District seat.\n\nLess than 12 hours after Cicilline won the Sept. 11 Democratic primary, Doherty held a news conference listing Cicilline's top 10 \"most serious deceptions.\"\n\nWe decided to look at number four, which focused on the outside audit of Providence finances covering the final fiscal year when Cicilline was mayor. (We\u2019ll be examining another item in Doherty's \"top 10\" separately.)\n\nWe quote from Doherty's news release attacking Cicilline: \"INTENTIONALLY MISSED DEADLINES: You were also required to provide key information about city finances to an independent outside auditor. The deadlines were clear -- yet you missed them by months. \u00a0You delayed providing that information until after you were elected to Congress.\"\n\nOur mind-reading skills are limited, so we can't judge whether any delay was prompted by an intent to withhold information until after the Nov. 2, 2010, general election. So we e-mailed the Doherty campaign late Wednesday to see if it had any evidence to back up that part of the allegation.\n\nMeanwhile, knowing that Cicilline has repeatedly said he is responsible for the decisions made during his tenure, we were interested in whether his administration had clear deadlines that it missed by months.\n\nDoherty's press release cited an April 20, 2011, report, \"Corrective Action Plan to Restore Sound Financial Management,\" written by Matthew M. Clarkin Jr., the city's internal auditor after Cicilline's departure, and Gary Sasse, who worked for 30 years as executive director of the nonprofit Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council and, more recently, a fiscal adviser to the Providence City Council.\n\n(The independent auditor does the city's official audit. The internal auditor works as a financial watchdog on behalf of the City Council.)\n\nThe report says that according to the independent auditor, Braver PC, when it was time to do the audit for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2010, \"For the first time in more than a decade the City requested a one-month extension from the Auditor General for the 2010 audit.\" State law gives cities and towns six months to complete annual audits.\n\nAccording to the report, \"In August 2010, Braver submitted a list of documents and information to the Director of Finance, [documents] that were required to complete the annual audit, as well as a deadline for the submission of each item.\"\n\nOn page 14, the report has a chart listing 15 types of financial information due by Oct. 12, 2010, or earlier, none of which was submitted to the auditor until after the Nov. 2 election, according to Braver. The delays ranged from about two months to about four months.\n\nThe report says the auditing firm \"was forced on several occasions to extend those deadlines. According to Braver, some of the information requested was not delivered until the day the report was released on January 31, 2011.\"\n\nThe report verified that the city was in serious financial trouble.\n\nJames Wilkinson, who oversaw the audit for Braver, confirmed the information in the Clarkin / Sasse report. The city had agreed to the original deadlines, he said.\n\nClarkin also sent us an e-mail from Wilkinson suggesting changes in the report. Wilkinson, in fact, suggests only minor alterations to the chart showing how the deadlines were missed, and he recommends adding the note that some requested information didn't come in until the day the audit was released.\n\nBut Wilkinson also ended his e-mail with an explanation for the delays.\n\n\"This year's closing process was marked by delays and problems caused by miscommunication among the accounting personnel. We believe that the year-end closing could proceed more quickly and smoothly by developing a logical order for closing procedures and assigning responsibility for completing the procedures to specific personnel,\" he wrote. That speaks to a finance department in disarray under Cicilline, not one withholding data for political purposes, as Doherty implies.\n\nWilkinson said the delay in 2010 was unusual for Providence. \"They did have turnover in the finance department so there were a lot of things going on,\" he said. \"There was cooperation but it was taking a while.\"\n\nBut more important, according to Wilkinson, if the city had met all of its deadlines for supplying financial information, the audit still would not have been completed before the election. It typically comes out in late December.\n\nCicilline spokesman Eric Hyers said Doherty falsely assumed that Cicilline knew about the auditor's deadlines and that the mayor instructed his staff to miss the deadlines. \"Neither of those things happened.\"\n\nDoherty campaign spokesman Robert Coupe acknowledged that there was no smoking gun showing that Cicilline or his staff ordered a delay in the release of financial data. But the delay, he said, was part of a pattern that kept the public in the dark about the city's finances.\n\nThere \"was a consistent pattern of withholding key financial information, not only from the external auditor, but also from the internal auditor, the City Council and the Rhode Island Division of Municipal Finance,\" he said.\n\nThat shows intent, Coupe argued. This \"was not an accident but was a component of the overall pattern and therefore intentional.\"\n\nOur ruling \n\nBrendan Doherty said David Cicilline, when he was mayor of Providence, was \"required to provide key information about city finances to an independent outside auditor. The deadlines were clear -- yet [he intentionally] missed them by months\" until after the November 2010 election.\n\nA subsequent report by the city on what led to its financial problems, along with a supporting e-mail from the firm that did the outside audit, support the claim that many deadlines for the outside audit were not met by the Cicilline administration.\n\nHowever, Doherty declared that Cicilline intentionally withheld the information until after the election, suggesting that the delay was designed to help him get elected to Congress.\n\nWe previously gave Cicilline a Mostly False on his statement that the internal auditor for the city of Providence \"was not locked out\" of access to the city's finances. We found evidence of serious delays but ultimately, in that case, that auditor (Clarkin's predecessor) received the long-sought information before the November election.\n\nBut in this instance, involving the outside audit, we've seen no real evidence -- and Doherty provided none -- that the delays were part of an attempt by Cicilline to hide bad news from voters.\n\nThe facts argue otherwise.\n\nThe external auditor himself judged the delays to be caused by a finance department in disarray.\n\nAnd even if every deadline had been met, the results of the audit would not have been released before the November election. Such audits are due at the end of the year, nearly two months after the votes are counted, a timetable noted in the very document the Doherty campaign cites.\n\nIn the end, we have the former head of the Rhode Island State Police making allegations without key evidence, and ignoring evidence that points in another direction.\n\nBecause his statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.\n\n(Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter: @politifactri.

{"label": "pants-fire", "claim": "Paul Sadler \"I never supported\" a state income tax for Texas.", "evidence": "A Washington-based political action committee, Club for Growth Action, calls Republican U.S. Senate candidate Ted Cruz a \"champion fighter\" in a radio ad titled \"Time\" while saying his July 2012 runoff foe, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, has advocated a wage tax and more spending.\n\nThe super-PAC ad\u2019s narrator says: \"It\u2019s no wonder every major newspaper in Texas calls Dewhurst a moderate.\" (Listen to the ad to the right.)\n\nWe\u2019ve poked into various tax-and-spending claims about Dewhurst. Dewhurst once supported a payroll tax though none made it into law. Contrary to Cruz claims, Dewhurst has never advocated a state income tax and has presided over cuts in state budgets.\n\nFor this foray, we wondered if every major Texas newspaper \"calls Dewhurst a moderate.\"\n\nOn the hustings, Cruz has hammered his contention that Dewhurst is a moderate, perhaps mindful that runoff voters are likely to be conservative-leaning. In this vein, a February 4, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news article quotes Rice University political science professor Mark Jones as saying that conservative Republican officeholders face a conundrum. \"Either they govern effectively and at times don't follow conservative principles to the letter, or they follow conservative principles and they don't get things done,\" Jones said. \"For many Republican Party activists, compromise is a dirty word.\"\n\nThe Statesman story goes on to say that the Texas Senate, over which Dewhurst presides, runs on compromise: \"For a bill to be considered, two-thirds of the 31 senators must agree, and Republicans are two seats shy of the votes needed to muscle legislation through without compromising with Democrats.\" The Republicans have not held a two-thirds\u2019 Senate majority in modern times.\n\nClub for Growth spokesman Barney Keller offered as initial backup to the group\u2019s claim headlines from articles printed in the two biggest Texas daily newspapers in 2007 and 2009 plus an October 2010 piece in the liberal Texas Observer political journal, which we set aside; the Observer is not a newspaper. Keller said he considers only the two papers with the most circulation in each state to be its \"major\" papers.\n\nUsing the Nexis search service, we fetched the newspaper stories, which turned out not to be straight news accounts. One was a reporter\u2019s commentary, in which the writer floats personal ideas or analysis, and the other was an editorial, the form of writing by which newspapers stake out positions on pages devoted to expressions of opinion.\n\nLet\u2019s recap them.\n\nThe January 29, 2007, news commentary by Clay Robison, then Austin bureau chief for the Houston Chronicle, opens: \"Around the state Capitol, (Dewhurst) is generally considered a more \u2018moderate\u2019 Republican than the other two members of the top leadership trio \u2014 Gov. Rick Perry and (House) Speaker Tom Craddick. But \u2014 shhh \u2014 don't talk about that too loudly, lest you spoil Dewhurst's effort to polish his image among the many Texas Republicans who are decidedly more conservative and who may hold the key to his political future.\"\n\nRobison\u2019s commentary also says that for \"all the convenience they afford political writers, labels can be dicey, and people at different ends of the political spectrum often don't agree on characterizations. There is little argument, though, that Dewhurst is part of a Republican leadership that is more conservative than the Democratic leaders of just a few years ago.\"\n\nHis column suggests that unlike Republicans, Democrats would not have closed a revenue shortfall in 2003 solely with budget cuts and higher tuition and likely would have raised taxes to minimize disruptions to public services. \"But Dewhurst and the Senate helped soften some of the spending cuts in 2003,\" the column says, \"and during last spring's special session on school finance, they led the way to securing a modest teacher pay raise.\"\n\nFinally, the commentary says Dewhurst \"has to seek consensus or compromise in the Senate because the body's operating rules give clout to the Democratic minority. According to friends and associates, the article says, he also is more moderate philosophically than many of the conservative voters and activists in his party,\" though Dewhurst also \"has to cultivate the votes\" of conservatives who dominate the Texas Republican primary.\n\nThe Jan. 14, 2009, Dallas Morning News editorial, headlined \"Dewhurst should avoid playing partisan hand,\" airs concern that Dewhurst\u2019s ambition for higher office could cause him to court \"hard-core conservatives\" while negotiating differences with House Speaker Joe Straus. \"Dewhurst often has served as a moderate Republican in his six years as the Texas Senate's leader,\" the editorial says, \"so chances are he will like having a pragmatic conservative like Straus across the Capitol. They should work better than Dewhurst did with former Speaker Tom Craddick, an ironclad conservative who quarreled with Dewhurst on issues such as school funding.\"\n\n\"So which Dewhurst will lead the Senate?\" the editorial says. \"The moderate conservative who has tried to rein in his party from becoming extreme on issues like budget cuts? Or the Dewhurst who's trying to win over staunch conservatives for another office?\"\n\nKeller, asked if he had other examples of major papers calling Dewhurst a moderate, passed along headlines for what turned out to be commentaries published in smaller newspapers in 2003, 2005 and 2007.\n\nIn the September 21, 2003, San Antonio Express-News, editorial writer Bruce Davidson said in his column that Dewhurst had described himself as a \"pro-growth conservative populist.\" The commentary continues: \"His earlier performance\" as lieutenant governor \"provided evidence to back up that description. The lieutenant governor's approach to vital budget issues was refreshing in a legislative session marked by the rest of the GOP leadership's stubborn stampede toward cuts that hurt the state's poorest residents. Dewhurst led the charge to find non-tax revenues to balance the budget with fewer cuts in the Children's Health Insurance Program than those advocated by other Republican leaders. He showed a willingness to tackle tough issues by proposing increased sales taxes to solve the public school funding crisis. The plan wasn't perfect, but at least Dewhurst was willing to lead instead of delay... For the next two years, Dewhurst remains the best hope for finding some political middle ground in Austin.\"\n\nIn the January 16, 2005, Corpus Christi Caller-Times, editorial writer Nick Jimenez wrote that in restoring some benefits to the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, open to families of the working poor, \"Dewhurst comes out as the moderate. He wants vision screening, dental and mental health benefits restored. And he wants the families who qualify to stay eligible for 12 months\" without having to re-enroll in intervening months.\n\nAnd in an opinion column in the February 4, 2007, Statesman, editor Rich Oppel wrote: \"Dewhurst got off to a good start in his first term as lieutenant governor, adopting a moderate stance and building the confidence of the 31-member state Senate.\"\n\nSo, five commentary or editorial items -- including pieces in the state\u2019s four largest newspapers -- published from 2003 through 2009 described Dewhurst as a moderate.\n\nNext, we widened our look by considering references to Dewhurst in the five biggest Texas papers according to daily circulation tallies listed in the Texas Daily Newspaper Association\u2019s 2012 online directory: the Chronicle (circulation 383,953); Morning News (238,869); Fort Worth Star-Telegram (167,364); Statesman (133,979); and Express-News (129,411).\n\nSearching the Nexis database for \"Dewhurst\" plus \"moderate\" delivered nearly 300 articles, though the vast majority of the stories reflect only Cruz or Cruz supporters characterizing Dewhurst.\n\nAmong other stories, an October 16, 2010, Morning News news article states: \"When Dewhurst was first elected lieutenant governor in 2002, he was viewed as a conservative, but more moderate in his approach than then-House Speaker Tom Craddick, a Republican from Midland who was often at odds with his Senate counterpart. Even Senate Democrats praised Dewhurst in his first session.\n\n\"But since then,\" the story continues, \"he has pushed harder for GOP-backed causes, such as voter ID legislation and abortion restrictions. And his leadership of the Senate is now seen by many as more partisan than when he came into office.\"\n\nIn a January 1, 2007, opinion column, William McKenzie of the Morning News voiced hopes for that year\u2019s legislative session and speculated that the ambitious Dewhurst might play to the center. \"His moderate instincts could prevail,\" the column says.\n\nMost recently, J.R. Labbe, editorial director for the Star-Telegram, wrote a May 14, 2012, commentary on the paper\u2019s decision to endorse another candidate over Dewhurst in the May Senate primary. Her commentary says: \"The Ted Cruz campaign describes Dewhurst as an \u2018establishment moderate\u2019 every chance it gets. It's meant as a put-down, but that's what Dewhurst used to be -- and he was an effective lieutenant governor.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nFrom 2003 through 2010, major Texas newspapers published a few stories referring to Dewhurst as a moderate.\n\n"}
{"label": "true", "claim": "One Wisconsin Now It\u2019s legal to \"sign a recall petition (against Gov. Scott Walker) even if you have already signed another recall petition,\" but only one signature counts", "evidence": "The liberal group One Wisconsin Now, worried about possible confusion over who can sign petitions to recall Gov. Scott Walker, issued a \"recall petitioners\u2019 rights\" memo in late November 2011.\n\nThe group said you only have to be a qualified voter in Wisconsin; you don\u2019t have to have voted here before or even have registered to vote.\n\nMildly surprising to some perhaps, but the next claim really jumped out.\n\nThe group wrote: \"You can circulate or sign a recall petition even if you have already signed another recall petition (note, however, that only one signature per person will be counted).\"\n\nCan you really sign a petition twice?\n\nAnd will it count for one signature -- or none, or two -- if you pen your name on separate petitions?\n\nIt\u2019s one of many points, from both sides, that has prompted confusion -- and accusations that opponents are misleading folks for their advantage. We already looked at a few process-related questions.\n\nHere\u2019s one more.\n\nIn state statutes, the recall law (Section 9.10) lists eight ways a signature could be nullified. Among them: It\u2019s not dated, was too early or late, the signer lives out of state, the address can\u2019t be confirmed.\n\nThere was nothing noted about a case of multiple signatures.\n\nBut deeper in the statute, we found an answer: \"If a challenger can establish that a person signed the recall petition more than once, the 2nd and subsequent signatures may not be counted.\"\n\nThat means the first signature is still good, but duplicates can be thrown out, said Reid Magney, spokesman for the Government Accountability Board, which oversees elections the recall process.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t guarantee they will be. It\u2019s up to the incumbent to challenge the validity of signatures.\n\nThe state Accountability Board will review the petitions, but isn\u2019t staffed to systematically check for duplicates, Magney said. That puts the onus on the gatherers or Walker\u2019s side.\n\nIf people do sign more than once, they face no penalties.\n\n\"There are no legal restrictions,\" Magney said.\n\nThat doesn't speak to practical concerns.\n\nMagney, for instance, noted that people signing more than once could put their own cause in jeopardy because that falsely inflates the true number of signatures.\n\nMagney said the Government Accountability Board is not encouraging people to sign multiple times. But he added there is an instance in which they could be justified in doing so.\n\n\"People should not sign a petition more than once unless they have some good faith reason to believe that the first petition was somehow fraudulent and believes the circulator doesn\u2019t intend to file it,\" Magney said.\n\nMagney said the agency has tried to make that clear after an anonymous Facebook group (Operation Burn Notice) said it believed \"burning recall petitions is fun and games.\"\n\nOne Wisconsin Now\u2019s executive director, Scot Ross, cited the same motive for publicizing the fact that signing twice is not illegal.\n\nThe group is concerned about fraud, especially illegal destruction of recall petitions. Ross said One Wisconsin Now supports but is not directly involved in gathering signatures as the Democratic Party and allied groups push to get 540,208 valid signatures by Jan. 14, 2012, when the 60-day period closes.\n\nOn the right, recall critics including the Republican Party of Wisconsin, and the MacIver Institute for Public Policy, have raised a different set of concerns.\n\nAlso citing Facebook chatter, they have raised alarms about fraud and double counting, contending that some duplicates will not be weeded out by state officials.\n\n\"Without a systematic review of signatures, how will we know if the proper process was followed and the threshold for recall was reached legally?\" Brett Healy, president of the MacIver Institute, told us. \"What is to stop someone from signing a petition three times or 30 times?\"\n\nMagney said the state agency will look for obvious cases of fraud.\n\nOur conclusion\n\nWe can\u2019t predict whether all multiple signers will be found, but state law makes clear that one -- and only one -- signature is to be counted. And it\u2019s perfectly legal to sign more than once. That was the focus of the statement from One Wisconsin Now"}

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Democratic National Committee Says Jeb Bush \"not only opposes marriage equality, he\u2019s said he \u2018personally\u2019 believes gay couples should be banned from adopting children.\"", "evidence": "When former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush announced he was exploring a bid to run for president, the Democrats let loose their opposition research.\nThe Democratic National Committee released talking points it wanted Democrats to use against Bush; Politico published a leaked copy on Dec. 19.\nBush then posted the talking points on his own Facebook page, denouncing the attacks as \"silly\" and \"misleading.\"\nThe DNC attacked Bush\u2019s statements and positions on a long list of topics, saying that another Bush presidency would mean policies \"that wreck the economy, that give massive breaks to the wealthy and corporations, and that are out of step with American people including women, LGBT Americans, Latinos and people of color. The reality is that Jeb Bush is no different than almost all Republicans on issue after issue.\"\nAmong the talking points was this one: \"Bush not only opposes marriage equality, he\u2019s said he \u2018personally\u2019 believes gay couples should be banned from adopting children.\"\nThe timing of that particular attack caught our eye, because in recent months plaintiffs have filed lawsuits to overturn Florida\u2019s gay marriage ban, which voters approved in 2008. Federal Judge Robert Hinkle ruled in August that the ban is unconstitutional, but he stayed his order to allow for appeals. After the U.S. Supreme Court rejected requests to extend the stay, Hinkle told county clerks they will be violating the U.S. Constitution if they don\u2019t issue same sex marriage licenses on Jan. 6. A Miami-Dade judge allowed gay marriages to proceed in that county Jan. 5.\nHere, we\u2019ll look at whether the DNC was accurate in saying that Bush opposes same-sex marriage and believes gay couples should be banned from adopting children.\nSame-sex marriage\nWhile in office from 1999 to 2007, Bush consistently opposed gay marriage, though he was not a leading crusader against it.\nIn 2004, Bush\u2019s brother President George W. Bush proposed an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to ban gay marriages. At the time, Florida law did not allow for same-sex marriage, though there was no specific ban on it in the state Constitution. In 2004, 11 states approved their own gay marriage bans.\nA spokeswoman for the DNC pointed to an article in the Tallahassee Democrat that stated: \"Bush supports his brother, President George W. Bush, in seeking a constitutional amendment to define marriage as a union of one man and one woman.\"\nOver the next few years, religious conservatives in Florida worked to get a question on the ballot banning gay marriage in the state constitution, and they succeeded in 2008.\nBush faced questions about it while in office. At times, he showed some support with caveats for a state constitutional ban, but he also often said that he was reluctant to change the Constitution.\n\"If there was a threat that gay marriage would be accepted in our state, then I might be supportive of it,\" Bush said in November 2004, according to the Orlando Sentinel. \"I'm not sure it's necessary to do this in a pre-emptive fashion.\"\nIt\u2019s worth noting that when Bush was in office, he had plenty of company among both Republicans and Democrats in opposing gay marriage. It wasn\u2019t until May 2012 that President Barack Obama made a Full Flop in favor of gay marriage. And it wasn\u2019t until March 2013 that Hillary Clinton announced she now supported gay marriage. That same month Bill Clinton denounced the Defense of Marriage Act that he had signed in 1996.\nGay adoption\nIn 2001, a federal judge upheld Florida\u2019s ban on gay adults adopting. The state argued that married heterosexuals provided a more stable home (even though the state allowed single people to adopt). Bush supported that ruling.\nAs Bush faced re-election in 2002, the ban remained a hot topic as a challenge winded its way through federal appeals court. Bush said he was reluctant to take a stand since the issue was in court.\n\n"}
{"label": "false", "claim": "Jason Haas Milwaukee lost the headquarters for MillerCoors because the area lacks good transit.", "evidence": "It\u2019s not uncommon to hear politicians sing the blues about a community. It makes sense -- to win an election, candidates have to convince voters they are the ones who can fix the problems.\n\nBut singing the blues can include some sour notes.\n\nTake Jason Haas, who is running for the 14th District seat on the Milwaukee County Board. In a statement to the Bay View Compass newspaper, he made a claim about Milwaukee County transit options that might make a voter in his district want to pony up more tax dollars for public transportation.\n\nHaas and his opponent, trucking company owner Steve Kraeger, submitted written responses to questions from the Compass, which appeared in the newspaper's Feb. 27, 2011 issue.\n\nIn one of his responses, Haas discussed his views on the importance of public transit, including this observation:\n\n\"Businesses have decided not to locate (in Milwaukee) precisely because there are no effective transit options; Milwaukee lost the headquarters of MillerCoors to Chicago, in large part, for that reason,\" Haas said.\n\nThis caught our attention. It didn\u2019t sound right that a multi-billion dollar company moved its headquarters out of its home town because of the transit system.\n\nWe called Haas for elaboration.\n\nHe said he based his comments on an article from the Business Journal, a MillerCoors press release and a study from the nonprofit Transportation Development Association.\n\nWe looked at Haas\u2019 evidence and found what amounted to the old game of telephone, where a statement is made, misunderstood, repeated, and so forth. The trail links Haas\u2019 statement to a misleading item from the Business Journal, and back to a Chicago Tribune article.\n\nBut let\u2019s start at the beginning -- the MillerCoors marriage and the merged company\u2019s decision on its corporate headquarters.\n\nAt the time of the merger in 2008, Milwaukee-based Miller Brewing Co. and Denver-based Coors Brewing Co. were the number two and three brewers in the United States, respectively.\n\nThe merger was a joint-venture, a 50-50 ownership deal that meant neither company was acquiring the other. Speculation was rampant for months over where the headquarters of the new company would be located.\n\nSince both Miller and Coors had an equal amount of power in the new company, \u00a0the headquarters decision was a touchy subject. Give the HQ to Denver or Milwaukee and it would be clear that one brewery was the \"winner.\"\n\nA July 16, 2008 Journal Sentinel article quoted MillerCoors President Tom Long as saying it would have been \"too difficult\" to choose either Milwaukee or the Denver area as the MillerCoors headquarters location.\n\n\"We came to the conclusion that we did need a neutral third place,\" he said.\n\nSo, it wasn\u2019t about transportation at all, at least not in eliminating Milwaukee.\n\nSo how did transportation come into this equation?\n\nBack to the decision. Eventually, MillerCoors narrowed the list of potential locations to Chicago and Dallas and in July of 2008 announced Chicago as its new home.\n\nThe office is at 250 S. Wacker Drive, just across the Chicago River from Union Station.\n\nThe company didn\u2019t abandon Milwaukee: It maintains a major brewery in Milwaukee, which employs about 800, as well as about 300 corporate jobs, said MillerCoors spokesman Julian Green.\n\nSuperior transportation system was part of the reason Chicago was chosen over Dallas.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where the game of telephone comes in.\n\nA July 16, 2008 Chicago Tribune article quoted Long as saying Chicago was chosen as the company\u2019s headquarters because of \"access to an attractive base of talent, transportation and business resources.\"\n\nThe Business Journal and the Transportation Development Association interpreted Long\u2019s comments in a different manner.\n\nThe TDA said \"the top reasons why MillerCoors chose to locate its corporate headquarters in Chicago rather than Milwaukee were access to an attractive base of talent, transportation and business resources.\"\n\nA July 27, 2008 article in The Business Journal suggested Milwaukee needs to upgrade its transit system, saying \"part of the decision\" as to why MillerCoors put its headquarters in Chicago was due to the city\u2019s transportation system. This was accurate, since it referred to the Chicago vs. Dallas choice.\n\nIn a November 2008 editorial, however, The Business Journal said that the Chicago transit system was a \"key part of MillerCoors\u2019 decision to locate the new joint venture\u2019s headquarters in that city, rather than Milwaukee.\"\n\nCandidate Haas repeated -- and elaborated -- upon that statement. \u00a0He said Milwaukee\u2019s lack of transit options was a \"large part\" of the reason MillerCoors went to Chicago.\n\nSo where does that leave us?\n\nHaas said Milwaukee lost the MillerCoors headquarters because it lacks effective transit. Yet there is no evidence the brewing company chose against Milwaukee for those reasons. Milwaukee and Denver were never in play. The company chose Chicago over Dallas, and, in doing so, the top executive praised that city\u2019s transit system"}

The story also says there \"are no mandated standardized tests in Finland, apart from one exam at the end of students\u2019 senior year in high school.\"\n\nThe test is the Finnish Matriculation Exam, according to a Finnish government web page, which says the exam\u2019s purpose is to \"discover whether pupils have assimilated the knowledge and skills required by the curriculum for the upper secondary school and whether they have reached an adequate level of maturity in line with that school`s goals. Passing the Matriculation Examination entitles the candidate to continue his or her studies at university.\"\n\nAccording to the web page, the exam is given each spring and fall.\n\nHowever, the exam is not a one-and-done.

This law is crumbling.\"\nMarkets with fewer insurers have been linked to fewer affordable choices for health insurance and higher prices.\nAs we\u2019ll see, Duffy might be right -- but he\u2019s a bit ahead of it\u2019s time.\nTrump\u2019s similar claim\nTo be clear, Duffy is referring to the relatively few Americans who buy their own health insurance on the Obamacare exchanges, not the vast majority who are covered by an employer or a government program such as Medicare.\nIn March 2017, when President Donald Trump claimed that one-third of the nation\u2019s counties \"only have one insurer left\" on the exchanges, PolitiFact National\u2019s rating was True. There was only one insurance provider to choose from in 32 percent of the nation\u2019s counties, based on figures from the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, a respected authority on health care.\nBut that was four months before Duffy\u2019s claim. And Duffy\u2019s claim goes further than those made by many Republicans. \u00a0\nDuffy\u2019s evidence\nTo back Duffy\u2019s statement, his office cited a June 2017 analysis by the New York Times. It estimated that 1,433 counties -- or about 45 percent of all counties -- are expected to have one insurer or no insurers in the Obamacare marketplaces, unless another carrier steps in. The marketplaces are where 12 million people buy their own coverage.\nThe Times said it used Kaiser data showing which companies currently offer plans in each county, and combined that with announcements from insurance companies saying which counties they plan to exit or enter in 2018.\n\n"}
{"label": "false", "claim": "Sean Hannity In 2007, when Nancy Pelosi met with President Assad of Syria, \"nobody got upset.\"", "evidence": "Republicans are accusing Democrats of a double standard when they criticize a letter that 47 GOP senators sent to Iranian leaders.\nThe Democratic criticism charges that the senators, in warning Iran\u2019s leadership against a pending nuclear deal, stepped on President Barack Obama\u2019s responsibility for handling foreign policy. But some Republicans counter that Democrats have taken on similar diplomatic efforts.\nOn his show March 10, 2015, Fox News host Sean Hannity said that Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., acted counter to President George W. Bush\u2019s strategy of diplomatically isolating Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, by traveling to Syria in 2007 to open up relations. Pelosi was then the House speaker.\nYet this barely caused a ripple at the time, Hannity suggested.\n\"In 2007, when Nancy Pelosi met with President Assad of Syria against the Bush administration's wishes, nobody got upset,\" Hannity said. \"But now this is the greatest sin of all times, and they're being called traitors in the New York Daily News on their cover.\"\nHannity was correct to say that Pelosi\u2019s visit with Assad went against Bush administration policy. At the time, the administration had adopted a strategy of diplomatically isolating Syria and not engaging in direct talks with Assad, because of the country\u2019s role in conflicts in Lebanon and Iraq.\nPelosi\u2019s office has pushed back against Hannity\u2019s claim that Pelosi\u2019s visit and the Republicans\u2019 letter to Iran are equivalent. But we won\u2019t delve into that question here. \u00a0\nInstead, we\u2019re going to look at whether Hannity was correct to say that \"nobody got upset.\"\nPoliticians and staff\nThe reality is that Republicans -- and some others -- at the time said Pelosi went beyond the role of representative and stepped unwelcome into the role of secretary of state.\nFor starters, the Bush administration spoke out publicly against the 2007 trip. Addressing reporters in reference to Pelosi\u2019s trip, Bush himself said, \"Sending delegations hasn\u2019t worked,\" according to the New York Times. \"It\u2019s just simply been counterproductive.\"\nVice President Dick Cheney also offered a harsh critique in an interview with radio host Rush Limbaugh.\n\"I'm obviously disappointed,\" Cheney said. \"I think it is, in fact, bad behavior on her part. I wish she hadn't done it, but she is the speaker of the House, and fortunately I think the various parties involved recognize she doesn't speak for the United States in those circumstances. She doesn't represent the administration. The president is the one that conducts foreign policy, not the speaker of the House.\"\nOn CBS, White House counselor Dan Bartlett said, \"We did ask her not to go. We did not believe it would advance the diplomatic efforts in the Middle East. I think most Americans would not think that the leader of the Democratic Party in the Congress should be meeting with the heads of a state sponsor of terror.\"\nMedia\nIn addition, both mainstream and the conservative media criticized Pelosi for the trip -- covering the back-and-forth extensively on the editorial pages, nightly shows and the Sunday political talk shows.

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Emergency Committee for Israel \"When Congress voted to condemn Iran for sentencing a Christian pastor to death, (U.S. Rep. Lois) Capps was the only member who voted no.\"", "evidence": "A new ad by the Emergency Committee for Israel -- a pro-Israel group whose board members include high-profile conservatives Bill Kristol and Gary Bauer -- pummels U.S. Rep. Lois Capps, D-Calif., over Middle East policy.\n\nWith a series of dark, conflict-heavy images and ominous music as a backdrop, the ad says, among other things, \"When Congress voted to condemn Iran for sentencing a Christian pastor to death, Capps was the only member who voted no.\"\n\nWe wondered if it was true that Capps was really the only lawmaker to vote no on that measure.\n\nIt turns out that Capps was indeed the only \"no\" vote recorded in the 417-to-1 roll call on March 1, 2012. But Capps says she voted that way by mistake, and she sought to correct the record immediately after the vote.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened, based on the Congressional Record and interviews with Capps\u2019 staff.\n\nThe bill, H. Res. 556, condemned the government of Iran for \"its continued persecution, imprisonment, and sentencing of Youcef Nadarkhani on the charge of apostasy.\" Nadarkhani, an Iranian Christian, was sentenced to death in 2010 for refusing to reject Christianity. He has since been freed, but at the time of the vote, his fate was uncertain, and his case had become something of a cause celebre.\n\nCapps cast a \"no\" vote, but within minutes of the floor vote, she or an aide realized that she had pressed the wrong button on the voting console. Within minutes, Capps addressed the House to explain her mistake.\n\n\"Mr. Speaker, I rise to correct the record,\" Capps said in remarks available on YouTube. \"I mistakenly voted \u2018no\u2019 just a few minutes ago on roll call (vote) 94 when I intended to vote \u2018yes,\u2019 and I ask unanimous consent that the Congressional Record reflect that correction. I do support H. Res. 556 (and condemn) the government of Iran for its state-sponsored persecution of religious minorities. I concur with the resolution in calling for the exoneration and immediate release of Youcef Nadarkhani and all other individuals held or charged on account of their religion.\"\n\nThat request was published in the Congressional Record, as was a longer statement that said in part, \"It is deplorable, and this House should denounce it in the harshest of terms. Pastor Youcef deserves to be free. He deserves to practice his faith and be home with his wife and young children. He deserves to have his rights as a human being upheld and respected. I urge a yes vote on H. Res. 556.\"\n\nCapps\u2019 office was also aggressive about correcting the record in the media. When the Christian Post published a story that cited Capps\u2019 \"no\" vote, an aide to Capps contacted the publication, which proceeded to run a correction.\n\nNoah Pollak, executive director of the Emergency Committee for Israel, didn\u2019t back down in an interview with PolitiFact. He said that Capps\u2019 vote \"is entirely consistent with the rest of her foreign policy record. Whatever excuses she came up with afterward -- obviously she is entitled to argue that case, but going with the way she voted, it\u2019s not inconsistent.\"\n\nThe problem for Capps is that once a vote is over, it\u2019s untouchable -- votes cannot be changed retroactively. So the official tally will always reflect Capps\u2019 mistaken vote rather than the one she intended.\n\nThat said, at least one expert in congressional procedure said that Capps handled a difficult situation as best as she could.\n\n\"Since we cannot read minds as to whether they made a mistake or were subsequently told by their office staff that they would be in deep political trouble if they do not make amends somehow, we have to take members at their word,\" said Donald Wolfensberger, a former Republican staff director of the House Rules Committee who currently directs the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. \"The sooner they correct things, the more believable they are; the later, the less so.\"\n\nWolfensberger added that today, so many votes are taken in clusters that an honest mistake in voting is plausible.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe official record does show that Capps was the only lawmaker to vote \"no\" on the resolution in question, but that\u2019s not the whole story. Quickly realizing her mistake, Capps took several steps to correct the record, including taking to the floor to clarify her position within minutes of the erroneous vote. The speed of her correction suggests that she is not simply changing her mind after the fact. The ad\u2019s claim contains an element of truth, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression"}

The ad relies on a clip from an interview Angle did with radio station KNPR, the NPR affiliate in Nevada, on May 19, 2010, when she was running in the GOP primary.\n\nThe exchange quoted in the ad begins with the host asking Angle, \"Would you eliminate the Department of Education or simply cut it back?\" Angle replies, \"I would like to go through to the elimination.\"\n\nWe wanted to look through the rest of the interview to make sure that Angle really does believe that the department should be eliminated.\n\nFirst, a little background on the Education Department. Its budget for fiscal year 2010 is about $64 billion. Of this, nearly $27 billion consists of Pell Grants, which fund disadvantaged students in college and graduate school. Another $25 billion is authorized by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, including funding to K-12 school systems around the country. An additional $12 billion comes from the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which helps fund education for disabled K-12 students. Much of the remainder is spent on educational research.\n\nWe went to the archived interview and found that the ad doesn't distort her view. Here's a transcript of the relevant portion of the interview:\n\n\"I believe that anything that isn't a federally governed, enumerated power in the Constitution, which means the federal government should be paying out on this, is up for grabs here,\" she said. \"And we have some departments like the Department of Education that passes down policy, one-size-fits-all, that fits no one. Like No Child Left Behind. We need to keep those education dollars right here in the state and put them where they will do the most good, which is right in that clasroom, with that classroom teacher. We need to cut down on those bureaucracies that take those educational dollars that should be going into that classroom.\n\n\"And it angers me every time I hear (politicians) say we're going to cut teachers,\" she continued. \"What about the agencies that never see a child, never have been in a classroom, that are passing down policy that actually overburdens our classrooms. What about those? Why don't we cut there?\"\n\nThat's when the host interjects. \"Would you eliminate the Department of Education or simply cut it back?\"\n\nAngle responds, \"I would like to go through to the elimination. I think we start by defunding it, and the reason that we should eliminate it is because its not the federal government's job to provide education for our children. It's a 10th Amendment right. It should be done here in the state, and it should be done as close to the local as possible.\"\n\nReviewing the exchange on KNPR, it seems to us that the ad portrayed Angle's stance accurately. She did not hesitate, backtrack or give any indication that she misspoke, even when the host gave her the opportunity to roll back the scope of her proposal.\n\nShe's expressed that position before, in a Mar. 22, 2010, interview with the conservative website Nevada News & Views, when she said she would like to eliminate not just the Education Department but the Energy Department and the Environmental Protection Agency as well.\n\n"}

During the Ohio Senate\u2019s floor debate on Dec. 1, Fedor gave a passionate speech comparing human trafficking, which often is a feature of prostitution rings involving juveniles, to the slavery trade.\n\nAs Fedor made her case for the legislation, she mentioned the frequent crackdowns on human trafficking that have taken place in recent years in her hometown of Toledo before uttering a startling statistic.\n\n\"Sadly, in Ohio, Toledo, in my district is fourth in the nation behind much bigger cities \u2014 Miami, Las Vegas, Portland (Ore.) \u2014 in number of human trafficking arrests and rescues,\" Fedor said.\n\nUndoubtedly, human trafficking is a problem in Ohio. We certainly are home to our share of teenage runaways, pimps and the problems that come with it. But could Toledo, the 60th largest city in the country with about 316,000 residents, really be fourth worst in the whole country?\n\nSounded like a case for PolitiFact Ohio.\n\nAsked for research to back up the ranking, Fedor\u2019s office punted to Celia Williamson, a University of Toledo professor who chaired a special Research and Analysis Subcommittee of the Ohio Trafficking in Persons Study Commission formed by the Ohio Attorney General\u2019s Office.\n\nWilliamson said Toledo\u2019s No. 4 status comes from statistics compiled by the Northwest Ohio Innocence Lost Task Force, an FBI task force that was one of 39 created in 2004 across the country to crack down on human trafficking. The commission\u2019s report listed Miami, Portland and Las Vegas as Nos. 1, 2 and 3.\n\nHowever, the Northwest Ohio task force\u2019s statistics actually show that Toledo is fourth in the nation in the number of human trafficking arrests, investigations and rescues that involve minors, Williamson clarified.\n\nBut she said she thinks the ranking is more of a reflection of heightened awareness of the problem in Toledo \u2014 rather than the problem truly being worse in Toledo than most other places in America.\n\n\"My personal opinion is that Cleveland is worse,\" she said. \"Cincinnati, Columbus and Youngstown all have a problem that is equal to Toledo, but they don\u2019t have the resources in place to respond.

About two weeks ago, opponents and supporters of the bill held competing rallies, one in Jersey City and one in Trenton.\n\nThe current version of the Act would set up a five-year pilot program to award scholarships to public and private school students residing in 13 school districts with failing schools, including Asbury Park and Newark. Public school students would be able to leave those districts and attend school elsewhere.\n\nThree organizations throughout the state would distribute the scholarships to parents or guardians of the selected students.\n\nCorporations making donations for the scholarships would get tax credits worth 100 percent of the value of their donations, costing the state millions\u2019 worth of tax revenue. That\u2019s where the school aid dollars come in.\n\nAccording to the state\u2019s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, which analyzed the Senate version of the bill, up to nearly $1.2 billion in state aid would be initially withheld from the 13 districts over the course of the program. Of that amount, about $354 million would be returned to the districts, according to OLS.\n\nBut the remaining roughly $840 million would be retained by the state to offset the loss of corporate business taxes, according to OLS.\n\nSo, the scholarships would not be directly funded by public school dollars, but in a roundabout way, education aid would be withheld to cover the tax credits granted to donors providing the scholarships.\n\nBut Adam Bauer, a spokesman for Republican state Sen. Tom Kean Jr., one of the bill\u2019s sponsors, argued that under the state\u2019s school funding formula, schools would lose a proportionate share of state aid if their enrollment declined for any other reason.\n\n\"That\u2019s how the formula works,\" Bauer said in an email. \"Why then is it such a travesty when this happens as a result of a student choosing to go elsewhere as part of a scholarship program?\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn a television interview, Rubin claimed the Opportunity Scholarship Act \"would be funded directly from public school budgets\" and \"take money out of the public school system to transfer to private and religious schools.\"\n\nThe program would not make a direct link between public school budgets and the scholarships.

Three decades later, it had dropped by more than half.\nThe violent crime rate saw a similar dramatic drop during this period.\nMoorlach\u2019s claim\nIn his op-ed, Moorlach focuses on crime \"since Jerry Brown was elected governor.\"\nWe took that to mean Brown\u2019s current stretch as governor, which started with his election to a third term in 2010 and continued with re-election to a fourth term in 2014.\nBrown served his first two terms as governor from 1975 to 1983.\nFor this current stretch, we looked at crime data from 2010 through 2016, the most current year available. We also considered the period 2010 through 2015 because Moorlach\u2019s spokesman said the senator did not have had access to a California Department of Justice report on crime for 2016, given that it was released two weeks after his op-ed published.\nNo matter the exact years selected, California\u2019s crime story during over the past half decade is not as simple as Moorlach\u2019s statement implies.\nThe statewide crime rate, which measures both violent and property crimes, ticked up in 2012 and 2015. It decreased, however, in the other four years during Brown\u2019s current stint.\nThis overall crime rate includes violent and property crimes. Violent crimes are homicides, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults. Examples of property crimes include burglary, theft and vandalism.\nJonathan Peterson, a fiscal and policy analyst at the California Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office, cautioned that year-over-year changes can make it look like crime is growing rapidly, \"but it could be a blip.\"\nPeterson said the past six to seven years have been marked by fluctuations in California\u2019s crime rate, not a steady increase or decrease.\nStanford Law School Professor John Donohue, who researches crime trends, said Moorlach's claim might contain an element of truth but overall is flawed.\u00a0\n\"One has to be very cautious about politicians making statements about crime because they will often try to make the numbers say something that isn\u2019t quite representative,\" said Donohue.\u00a0\"The broad trend for the last 25 years has been down and very benign. Crime is at a much lower level in practically every place today than it was 25 years ago.

So, we thought we\u2019d find out if Baldwin is right.\nDoes the military use the same weaponry the Orlando shooter did?\nCivilian vs. military guns\nThe Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, had two firearms the night he killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in a Florida nightclub -- a rifle and a 9mm handgun. Both were purchased legally.\nThe rifle was a Sig Sauer MCX semiautomatic. That is what Baldwin meant when she cited \"a weapon of war\" and what we are looking at in this factcheck.\nBaldwin\u2019s claim was a very stark one. While guns of many varieties may be used in battle, we view the phrase \"a weapon of war\" in this context to mean a gun used by the military.\nAs backup, Baldwin\u2019s team sent us to a couple news articles and gun reviews. The first news article, dated June 16, 2016, was from the Associated Press and carried the headline, \"Rifle used in Orlando shooting was designed for military use.\"\nHer staff also pointed us to videos from the rifle\u2019s manufacturer and highlighted some portions of the videos, including a point when Kevin Brittingham, president of the company\u2019s silencer division, says \"the Sig MCX was designed to meet the DOD (Department of Defense) requirement for a weapon that would be as compact as possible, that focused on signature reduction. (They) wanted something as quiet as possible and also wanted something that would engage targets out to 300 meters.\"\nBut it\u2019s not that simple. The article and the video don\u2019t address the differences between the guns issued to soldiers and those sold to civilians.\nThe Sig Sauer MCX rifle Mateen carried is a civilian version of the MCX-MR, a gun designed for military use. The MCX-MR was designed to comply with a Department of Defense requirement for a weapon to be carried by special operations units with low visibility in terms of size and noise.\nA backgrounder on the gun from the Violence Prevention Center sent to us by Baldwin\u2019s team said, \"there are no significant differences between them and military assault weapons.\"\nBut Leigh Neville, a military researcher and author of the book \"Guns of the Special Forces,\" said the two versions differ \"fundamentally.\"\nThe civilian MCX lacks three key design attributes that make the MCX-MR suitable for special operations use.\n1. \u00a0The civilian version is semiautomatic, rather than fully automatic.

But in our travels around the state, we still don\u2019t see many farms. Is farming really growing as quickly as Chafee said?\n\n\nIt seemed that it would be simple to find out. But a search for information took us on a frustrating odyssey through five state agencies and offices and two federal departments.\n\n\nWe began with an e-mail to Christine Hunsinger, Chafee\u2019s communications director, asking for \u00a0the governor\u2019s backup. She cited U.S. Department of Agriculture data from 2007 -- the latest available -- that shows the number of farms in Rhode Island had increased from 858 to 1,219 between 2002 and 2007, a 42 percent increase. A farm is defined as \"any place from which $1,000 or more of agricultural products were produced and sold\" in a year.\n\n\nImpressive, yes. But just because the number of farms increased by that rate, it doesn\u2019t mean that the overall economic impact of farming increased at the same rate. The report doesn\u2019t say whether the new farms were substantial or only large gardens. And there are no comparisons with other sectors of the economy.\n\n\nWe called the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation, but a spokesman said the corporation had no statistics regarding the economic profile of farming.\n\n\nWe also contacted the Division of Agriculture of the state Department of Environmental Management, where division chief Kenneth Ayars directed us to \"The Economic Impact Study of Plant-Based Industries and Agriculture in Rhode Island.\"\n\n\nUniversity of Rhode Island researchers estimated in the study that agriculture, which they defined to include plant crops and animal production as well as nurseries, greenhouses, floriculture and sod production, generated $170.6 million in gross sales in 2012.\n\n\nThe study was motivated, in part, by critics\u2019 contention that federal government statistics understate Rhode Island farming. But it was only a snapshot and didn\u2019t tell whether agriculture is growing, shrinking or static.\n\n\nIn a second e-mail, Hunsinger referred us to the U.S. Census for the same period as the USDA data, 2002-2007. Unlike the USDA, the Census compared farming to 18 other business sectors in Rhode Island as defined by the North American Industry Classification System.

She pointed us to a 2014 memo that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sent to the committee in response to questions about the federal agency\u2019s figures on undocumented immigrants expelled from the U.S.\nThe agency\u2019s figures show that in 2008, the year before Obama took office, there were 244,091 removals of illegal immigrants from the interior of the U.S., which the agency defines as anywhere away from the \"immediate border\" where an immigrant is barred from trying to enter the country illegally. In 2009, there were 237,941 interior removals in the first year of Obama\u2019s term. That dropped to 133,551 by year 2013.\nThose figures represent a broad group of deportations which include two main categories. One is \"removals,\" where someone is ordered out of the country by a formal court order and prohibited from coming back for a period of time. The other category is \"returns,\" where an immigrant voluntarily leaves the U.S., often in the absence of a formal order. That situation typically doesn\u2019t carry harsh penalties if they return to the country.\nThe immigration agency further broke down its figures for the House panel, excluding simple returns and focusing on formal removals. In 2008, there were 171,540 of those removals from the interior. That rose to 175,702 in Obama\u2019s first year in office in 2009 before falling to 110,781 in 2013.\nIn 2014, ICE said it conducted 102,224 removals.

Transporting people over a border is not in and of itself an element of human trafficking.\nNothing the Biden administration has done amounts to human trafficking, experts said.\n\"Using international definitions and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, which is what legislates and defines trafficking in the U.S., we have nothing close to that,\" Correa-Cabrera said. \"The government is not recruiting, transporting, transferring or harboring people for the purpose of exploiting them in any form \u2014 sexual exploitation, forced labor or anything else \u2014 and they are not using force, fraud or coercion to make that exploitation possible.\"\u00a0\nMigrant smuggling occurs when smugglers transport migrants across borders for a fee\u00a0and both parties consent, experts said. Smugglers can put migrants in danger, but it is not the same as trafficking.\n\"It is self-evident that this is not trafficking, as they (the Biden administration) are releasing the children to be reunited with their families,\" said David Kyle, associate professor of sociology at the University of California, Davis. \"So this is a very sensational and inaccurate framing of what we are looking at.\"\nIn a statement to PolitiFact, the Department of Homeland Security said Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has \"repeatedly warned\" about abuses by smugglers.\nThe Biden administration\nExperts also rejected Pavlich\u2019s claim that the Biden administration is enabling human trafficking by delivering unaccompanied minors to \"unvetted\" sponsors rather than swiftly expelling them.\nThe Biden administration\u2019s decision to take in minors despite the coronavirus pandemic is a change from the Trump administration and a reason for the crowding at the border. But not expelling minors has \"nothing\" to do with human trafficking, Correa-Cabrera said. She and other experts said such children could be escaping trafficking in their home countries.\n\n"}

For Reagan and George H.W. Bush, we used Office of Management and Budget historical data, which shows the debt level at the end of the fiscal year. That\u2019s not a perfect fit with presidential terms -- the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30 while the president is sworn in on the following Jan. 20 -- but we determined it was close enough for a rough estimate.\nSo how do the presidents stack up when you measure the raw increase in debt during their tenure -- the specific statistic the tweet appears to cite?

Scott Walker\u2019s collective bargaining law.\n\n(On March 24, 2011, the state appeals court panel asked the state Supreme Court to take the case. Prosser has indicated he will not recuse himself.)\n\nSo, let\u2019s evaluate Kloppenburg\u2019s claim.\n\nSince the campaign has only begun to take on a high profile as the April 5 election approaches, let\u2019s first lay some foundation.\n\nProsser, 68, was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1998 and was re-elected three years later to a full 10-term term. He previously spent 18 years in the state Assembly representing the Appleton area; for eight of those years he was the Republican leader.\n\nKloppenburg, 57, of Madison, has been an assistant state attorney general since 1989, working both as a prosecutor and a litigator. This is her first run for public office.\n\nKloppenburg has made contributions to Democratic candidates, but not Republicans, according to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign database. Groups that have endorsed her most recently include the Sierra Club, the Madison police union and a union that represents public employees in Milwaukee County.\n\nSince 2008, Prosser has been part of a 4-3 conservative majority that controls the Supreme Court. A win by Kloppenburg, who is backed by many people upset with Walker\u2019s collective bargaining law, would create a 4-3 liberal majority.\n\nWe asked Kloppenburg campaign spokeswoman Melissa Mulliken for evidence that Prosser has prejudged matters that are likely to be brought to the high court -- more specifically, which matters. Mulliken said there were none. Kloppenburg\u2019s allegation against Prosser, she said, was made as a broader statement.\n\nAccusing Prosser of prejudging matters, but providing no examples \u2026 well, that takes a lot of the steam out Kloppenburg\u2019s claim.\n\nHer campaign did cite four statements -- three by Prosser\u2019s campaign spokesman, Brian Nemoir, and one by Prosser himself -- as evidence to back up the accusation. We treat a statement from a spokesman as having been made by the candidate himself.\n\nSo let\u2019s examine what Kloppenburg cited.\n\n\"Complement\"\n\nIn a Dec. 8, 2010, news release announcing Nemoir as Prosser\u2019s campaign spokesman, Nemoir said Prosser would be a \"common-sense complement to both the new administration and Legislature.\"\n\nThe reference was to Walker, who had been elected governor but not yet taken office, and Republicans who would control the Senate and Assembly in January.\n\nProsser disavowed the statement weeks later, saying he had not seen it before it went out.\n\nBut the statement left a clear impression that, rather than being part of an independent judiciary, Prosser saw himself as in league with Republicans who controlled the executive and legislative branches of government.\n\n\"Closely mirrors\"\n\nAfter Kloppenburg blasted the \"complement\" comment, Nemoir responded with an e-mail the next day describing Prosser as an independent, \"rule-of-law judge.\"\n\nIn the same statement, however, Nemoir said Prosser\u2019s \"personal ideology more closely mirrors that of the incoming administration and Legislature.\"\n\nThe Kloppenburg campaign cited that as evidence of prejudging.\n\nBut Kloppenburg ignored the rest of Nemoir\u2019s quote, which was that Prosser\u2019s \"impartial approach to applying the law won't deviate\" -- in other words, that he would not prejudge cases.\n\n\"Conservative majority\"\n\nNemoir said Feb. 9, 2011, that the Prosser-Kloppenburg race \"is about a 4-3 common-sense conservative majority vs. a 3-4 liberal majority, and nothing more.\"\n\nThis statement essentially reiterates that Prosser is a conservative who could hold a swing vote on the Supreme Court. It doesn\u2019t support Kloppenburg\u2019s claim that Prosser has shown he would prejudge cases.\n\n\"Political conservative\"\n\nKloppenburg\u2019s campaign cited instances in which Prosser also described himself as a political conservative, and claimed that indicates prejudging.\n\nAt a March 22, 2011, debate, Prosser acknowledged being a political conservative. But he said that since becoming a justice, he has \"tried very hard to withdraw from the political process, move to the center of the political spectrum, and view each case impartially on the facts of the law.\"\n\nAs with the earlier comments, Prosser calling himself a political conservative is not evidence that he would ignore facts and the law in how he votes on the Supreme Court.\n\nTime for a verdict.\n\nThe statements cited by Kloppenburg indicate Prosser is politically conservative, has views similar to Walker and GOP leaders in the Legislature, and that his re-election would maintain a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. The fact that Prosser disavowed one statement, about his being a \"complement\" to Walker and other GOP leaders, indicates he had concern about signaling how he might rule on cases.\n\u00a0\nBut Kloppenburg didn\u2019t accuse Prosser of giving signals. She said he had \"prejudged matters that are likely to come before the court.\" Yet she could provide no examples"}

Aaron Britt, communications director for the Iowa Republican Party wrote in an email to The Daily Iowan the \"smashing turnout records for similar caucus years\" claim referred to \"caucus turnout in general for years with an incumbent president.\"\u00a0\nBritt said turnout for the Republican caucuses in 2004 when George W.

That compares with an estimate of more than 25,000 when Barack Obama was the incumbent in 2012, according to a statement from Sue Dvorsky, who chaired the Iowa Democratic Party then.\u00a0\nTrump received 97% of support in the Iowa caucuses, according to the Iowa Republican Party. Challenger Bill Weld received one pledged delegate from Iowa. In 2012, Obama received 99% of delegates, with 1% of delegates committed to undecided.\u00a0\nWe found Trump, his campaign and the Iowa GOP were accurate in claiming that turnout for Trump was higher on the Republican side than that from Democrats for Obama in 2012 and also for recent Republican incumbents \u2014 George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush \u2014 in Republican caucuses, and for Democratic incumbent Bill Clinton in 1996.\nThe tweet included New Hampshire, where Trump set a record turnout for an incumbent.\nBut the broad statement of smashing turnout records from Iowa requires qualifiers like the one Britt provided when asked. That\u2019s because news reports from previous caucuses show in years when an incumbent was not running far exceed the 2020 Republican turnout. In 2012, more than 122,000 Republicans voted during their caucuses, the Des Moines Register reported.\u00a0\nWhile Trump\u2019s campaign encouraged Iowa Republicans to show their support for the president at the caucuses, preference votes weren\u2019t taken at the caucuses for the uncontested nominations for incumbents Ronald Reagan in 1984, George H.W.

First, we need a brief lesson in recent history.\nThe Libyan crisis\nLibya has largely been in chaos since revolutionaries -- with NATO help -- deposed and killed dictator Moammar Gaddafi in 2011. An interim, Islamist-filled government was elected to help Libya make the transition to a democracy, but refused to give up power after its term was up.\nGen. Khalifa Haftar (at right), who served in the army during the Gaddafi regime and fought against the dictator during the 2011 coup, was instrumental in replacing the interim government so a new parliament could be elected in 2014. Control of the country is now split between an Islamist government based in Tripoli in the west and an internationally recognized government led by Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thani in Tobruk in the east.\nHaftar now commands forces fighting Islamist extremists to support the Tobruk government. The country is dotted with militias, clans and terror groups, many of whom fight among each other for territory and almost indiscernible goals.

That distinction would go to a terror group known as Ansar al-Sharia, or the Partisans of Islamic Law.

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Coalition to Bring Jobs to R.I. \"By voting to approve [Question 1], we can . . . save 900 jobs\" at Twin River.", "evidence": "Once again, the state's two slot parlors are rolling the dice in hopes that Rhode Islanders -- along with residents of Lincoln and Newport, where the facilities are located -- will approve referenda permitting the table games that will make them full-fledged casinos.\n\nWhile recent polls show support for the measure, it's anything but a sure bet, and the businesses are spending millions to win support for the measure.\n\nOne commercial in support of Question 1 is sponsored by Coalition to Bring Jobs to R.I., a 501(c)4 nonprofit \"social welfare\" organization created by officials at Twin River, in Lincoln, the larger of the two facilities.\n\nIt features an East Providence woman who talks about the problems of the Rhode Island economy and tells viewers: \"By voting to approve, we can keep revenue right here, save 900 jobs and help create 650 new ones.\" The ad makes no mention of the Newport facility, Newport Grand.\n\nWe were interested in checking whether defeat of Question 1 would really result in the loss of 900 existing jobs at Twin River.\n\n(A comparable proposal, Question 2, would allow table games at Newport Grand.)\n\nTwin River and Newport Grand want to add table games to remain competitive with the three casinos and one \"racino\" expected to be created in Massachusetts in the next several years.\n\nThe fear is that, without the table games, customers will flock to the Bay State instead. The stakes are huge for the Rhode Island state budget: the two businesses accounted for $321 million of revenue in the budget year that ended June 30, 2012 -- about 10 percent of all revenue.\n\nSo will 900 jobs be lost if Question 1 is rejected?\n\nOnly if Twin River shuts down completely.\n\nIt turns out that 900 is roughly the number of workers that Twin River says it employs now.\n\nIf the referendum is rejected, Twin River will continue operating.\n\nIn the short term, the first Massachusetts casino is not expected to open its doors for a few years.\n\nAnd even with the Bay State casinos up and running, Twin River can be profitable, said Clyde Barrow, \u00a0director of the Center for Policy Analysis at UMass Dartmouth and an expert on gambling in the region.\n\nThe assumption in the ad is that if voters don't authorize table games Twin River will close, Barrow said. \"I don't think that's the case. It's true that once the slot parlor casinos are open in Massachusetts, they do stand to lose as much as 50 percent of their net terminal income,\" which was $463 million in 2011.\n\n\"Even if Twin River went to a $225-million-a-year operation, that's still a pretty substantial facility,\" said Barrow. \"It's larger than some of the casinos in Atlantic City. So it will definitely have the capacity to still be profitable at a smaller level of operation.\"\n\n\"They would certainly have to lay some people off,\" said Barrow, \"But it wouldn't be the full 900.\"\n\nWe also checked a report commissioned by Gov. Lincoln Chafee that included projections of employment at Twin River with and without table games under various scenarios.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, where at least one Massachusetts casino is built near Rhode Island, Twin River would have 397 fewer jobs in 2017 than in 2011 if table games aren't permitted. With table games, the loss would be cut to 118 jobs.\n\nBut that's just the worst scenario.\n\nThe report says the likeliest outcome is that 319 jobs would be lost if table games were not allowed, and 201 jobs would be gained if Question 1 were to be passed.\n\nUnder any scenario, that's not close to 900 jobs.\n\nWhen we contacted Twin River, spokeswoman Patti Doyle said that if there are no table games in Rhode Island, Twin River expects to lose 25 percent to 35 percent of its gambling revenue when Massachusetts casinos open. Twin River expects the competition to be on line by late 2016 or early 2017.\n\n\"A gaming revenue decline at Mohegan Sun and Atlantic City brought nearly a parallel reduction in work force,\" she said. \"So, it's safe to assume that a loss of revenue of 25 percent would translate into a 25 percent loss of our workforce.\"\n\nA 25 percent to 35 percent reduction would result in cuts of 225 to 315 jobs, not 900.\n\nNonetheless, Doyle says Twin River isn't suggesting that the gambling complex might have to close its doors.\n\n\"That's not what the ads are saying, nor are we saying that now,\" she wrote in an e-mail. \"We can say with certainty with table game approval, none of the existing 900 jobs will be lost.\"\n\nBut that's not what the ad says, nor how most people will perceive it.\n\nOur Ruling\n\nThe Coalition to Bring Jobs to R.I., an organization pushing for approval of a referendum question to permit table games at Twin River, says that passage would save 900 jobs in Rhode Island.\n\nBut the only way 900 jobs would be lost at Twin River would be if it closed, and nobody -- including Twin River -- is saying that's going to happen.\n\nEven if Twin River had to scale back its operation by 25 percent to 35 percent, that's not close to the 900 positions that Jobs to R.I. says are at risk.\n\nBecause the company -- based on its own estimates -- is overplaying its hand, offering a statement that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.\n\n(Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter: @politifactri.

Ford Gravitt said, \"unless there is a specific reason.\"\n\nPolitiFact Georgia thought the mayor\u2019s statement was odd, considering our reporters have covered countless City Council meetings throughout the Atlanta region.\n\nThe city of Cumming is a political subdivision that must abide by the laws of the state of Georgia, which has clear guidelines that generally allow meetings of elected officials to be recorded on video. When the mayor uses the collective \"we\" in his statement, he is speaking as the elected head of the city.\n\nWe wondered whether the mayor had a basis for his objection and decided to put it up for a vote on our Truth-O-Meter.\n\nIn a strange bit of timing, Tisdale was tossed from the council meeting on the same day Gov. Nathan Deal signed House Bill 397, a revised state law on open meetings and records aimed at providing greater access to documents and public meetings.\n\nTisdale, apparently, likes to use the laws to keep others informed about what\u2019s going on in Forsyth County. She has a YouTube channel that includes a recording of a contentious Forsyth County Planning Commission meeting and video of candidate forums.\n\nTisdale was asked to turn off her camera at one Planning Commission meeting because one of the members was distracted by Tisdale holding the camera while speaking to the board. She declined to do so, and she began to recite the state\u2019s open meetings laws.\n\n\"That\u2019s fine,\" the official said.\n\nTisdale was recording the April 17 council meeting for nearly two minutes before it started. Once Gravitt called the meeting to order, he turned his attention to Tisdale. The mayor asked the police chief to have the camera removed.\n\n\"Respectfully, mayor, Georgia\u2019s sunshine laws ...\" Tisdale says on the recording.\n\n\"It\u2019s not for discussion,\" Gravitt says, waving his hands.\n\n\"I\u2019m expressing my right as a citizen to record this meeting,\" Tisdale says as the camera shakes and her voice rises. \"Sir, this is an open, public meeting.\"\n\nGravitt tells Tisdale she\u2019s allowed to take notes.\n\nTisdale responds by saying the city is violating the state\u2019s open meetings law. She eventually turns off her video camera after being removed from the meeting.\n\nSo was this a violation of the Georgia Open Meetings Act?\n\nAs promised, Tisdale filed a complaint with the state. The Georgia Attorney General\u2019s Office sent Cumming City Attorney Dana Miles a letter dated April 19 that said \"Georgia law expressly allows video recording of public meetings.\"\n\nTitle 50, Section 14 of the Georgia Open Meetings Act states that \"[v]isual, sound, and visual and sound recording during open meetings shall be permitted\" at city council and other meetings. The act does not apply when governing bodies are discussing the acquisition of real estate, records that are not allowed for public inspection and most personnel matters.\n\nThe mayor told Fox 5 Atlanta that he ordered the video camera turned off because of safety concerns.\n\n\"I think if it's a safety issue, and you have people running over you maybe in a case of emergency, I think you can use some common sense,\" Gravitt said.\n\nHe added: \"Visual and sound equipment, it may be permitted.

{"label": "pants-fire", "claim": "Rick Perry More than 3,000 homicides were committed by \"illegal aliens\" over the past six years.", "evidence": "Republican Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general seeking a second term against Democrat Justin Nelson, invoked previously debunked numbers when he was asked about Democrats seeking to decriminalize border crossings.\nPaxton, in an Aug. 26, 2018, appearance on \"Fox & Friends,\" called decriminalizing crossings \"a little scary,\" telling the host: \"Obviously, you know we\u2019re a border state.

The story quoted Beto O\u2019Rourke, the Democratic U.S. Senate nominee, specifying that people seeking asylum at the border shouldn\u2019t be charged with criminal violations.\nWe can\u2019t check a prediction about what happens if fewer people crossing the border get charged with crimes. But the big crime counts aired by Paxton\u00a0reminded us we\u2019ve long found flaws in citations of counts of crimes and homicides attributed to information publicized by the Texas Department of Public Safety, the lead state agency tasked with helping keep watch over the Texas-Mexico border.\nLet\u2019s plumb our\u00a0relevant past fact-checks before reviewing the meat of Paxton\u2019s statement.\nRick Perry's flammable 2014 claim\nIn July 2014, Gov. Rick Perry warned about the security of the Texas-Mexico border by \u00a0declaring that more than 3,000 homicides had been committed by \"illegal aliens\" in six years.\nPants on Fire, we ruled, in that Perry had misrepresented figures on a DPS web page that could be read, at worst, to indicate that in their lifetimes, an unspecified subset of 203,685 \"criminal alien defendants\" booked into Texas jails over the nearly six years through June 2014 had been charged with--not convicted of committing--3,070 homicides.\nWe identified other complications that, it turned out, also weakened a pair of subsequent claims we checked that were based on DPS-posted numbers.\nTo begin with, the term \"criminal aliens\" is generally used by law enforcement to identify noncitizens residing in the U.S. who are convicted of a crime--and such individuals include people living here legally or without legal authorization.\nAlso, Michael Walker, an adjunct professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New \u00a0York, said the DPS information didn\u2019t even demonstrate the homicides occurred any time recently or in any particular state. Meantime, Northeastern University criminologist Ramiro Martinez, Jr. built his own analysis of Texas crime numbers and told us that if Perry\u2019s claim held up, it would mean that more than half the state\u2019s homicides in the six years were committed by unauthorized residents--an absurdity. \"It just boggles the imagination that level of \u2018aliens\u2019 were involved to that extent over time and nobody noticed,\" Martinez commented.\nTwo 2018 immigrant-crime claims\nEarly this year, we replowed DPS-posted numbers before rating Pants on Fire Lt.

We\u2019ll none of that has come true. \u2026 I think that pointing out a snail\u2019s pace in the job (growth) numbers is not going to be enough to undo 26 million jobs that are lost, Meredith.\"\n\nWe wondered: Has the number of jobs really declined by 26 million since Obama has been president?\n\nThe answer: Not by any standard method of calculating job losses.\n\nWe turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official arbiter of U.S. employment numbers. We found that in January 2009, when Obama was sworn in, 133,563,000 Americans were employed. Today, that number is 130,738,000. That\u2019s a significant decline -- but of 2.8 million jobs, a number roughly a tenth of what Priebus cited.\n\nWe then looked at the difference between the highest level of employment during the recent recession and the lowest level. From its peak in December 2007 to its bottom in February 2010, a total of 8.7 million jobs were lost. That\u2019s still only about one-third of the number Priebus gave -- and that period was split roughly evenly between the presidencies of George W. Bush and Obama.\n\nWe arrived at these figures, as economists do, by comparing job gains with job losses to determine a net total. It\u2019s theoretically possible that 26 million jobs were lost during the Obama presidency and that 23.2 million jobs were created, leaving a net of 2.8 million jobs lost. But even if that were the case, economists across the political spectrum say it would be highly misleading of Priebus to focus on the job losses without citing the offsetting job gains.\n\nIt would not be \"kosher to count only one-half of the jobs equation,\" said Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute. Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution said it would be \"absurd\" to cite the gross job numbers instead of the net numbers.\n\nJust for a sense of scale, if it were a net number, losing 26 million jobs, as Priebus indicated, would mean losing about 20 percent of the nation\u2019s jobs -- something on the scale of the Great Depression.\n\nWe e-mailed the Republican National Committee\u2019s press office for an explanation, but they did not reply by the time we posted this story.\n\nPerhaps Priebus simply misspoke, or perhaps he misplaced a decimal point and ended up wrong by a factor of 10.

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Charlie Crist Says Jeb Bush \"extended early voting\" after seeing \"long lines.\"", "evidence": "Former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist emerged as a prominent critic of Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s decision not to extend early voting before the presidential election.\n\nCrist, a Republican-turned-independent who campaigned on behalf of President Barack Obama, joined Florida Democrats in asking Scott to give voters more time to cast early votes, citing long lines in Orlando and South Florida on Nov. 4, 2012, the last day of early voting.\n\nScott declined to extend early voting to Sunday, a move Crist denounced as \"unconscionable\" given the hours-long wait times. In an interview with Miami-based CBS 4, Crist pointed to his decision as a Republican governor in 2008 to extend early voting, a move that irritated Republicans who thought (correctly) it would help Obama voters.\n\n\"Got a lot of grief from Republicans, but you know, when you\u2019re governor, you don\u2019t just work for one party or the other, you work for the people of the state,\u2019\u2019 Crist said on Nov. 4, 2012. \"I saw the long lines. I saw that it was still hot in South Florida, a lot of senior citizens were waiting in those lines. And I realized it was an emergency situation where people needed to have the opportunity to vote.\n\n\"The same thing, or a similar thing, happened under Gov. Jeb Bush, and he extended early voting as well as governor,\" Crist said.\n\nWe wondered if Bush really extended early voting during an emergency-like situation.\n\nEarly voting\n\nBush actually signed into law the statewide maximum of 14 days for early voting in 2004. Election supervisors said it was highly popular and asked the Legislature to expand early voting hours and add more locations.\n\nBut Bush and the GOP-led Legislature went the other way the next year, passing a law that capped the number of hours for early voting and confined it to election offices, city halls and libraries.\n\nEarly voting remained popular -- especially with Democrats. In 2011, the Legislature and Scott enacted a new law that reduced the maximum early voting days to eight days. Democrats in the Legislature said the law was designed to depress voter turnout among people in their party.\n\nThe 2002 primary\n\nThings were going haywire in South Florida during the primary election on Sept. 10, 2002, the first statewide election since the infamous 2000 presidential recount. It was the election that determined Bill McBride, and not Janet Reno, would be the Democratic gubernatorial challenger for Bush.\n\nSome precincts in Broward and Miami-Dade counties opened hours after their scheduled 7 a.m. start. New, untested touch-screen voting machines malfunctioned. Some people walked away without casting a vote.\n\nBush issued an executive order that called for polls to stay open two additional hours statewide. That meant the polls stayed open until 9 p.m. for most of the state and 10 p.m. for the Panhandle, which is in the Central Time Zone.\n\nNeither Bush nor his top elections official, Secretary of State Jim Smith, were pleased with having to make the call.\n\n\"I frankly wonder what in the hell have they been doing for two years,\" Smith was quoted as saying about the South Florida elections officials in an Associated Press report. \"I am hopeful that by November, at least they will be able to open the polls on a timely basis and the equipment will work.\"\n\nBush ordered the extension \"out of fairness,\" according to the Associated Press.\n\n\"It's shameful. It's the responsibility of the supervisors of election to be prepared,\" Bush said. \"The state put up money - significant sums of money - for training, for machines. ... There's no excuse for not having precinct workers in a precinct for voting, no excuse for not turning on the machines.\"\n\nIn a phone interview with PolitiFact Florida, Crist said the point he was trying to make about Bush was that \"the guy had a heart\" amid chaos at the polls.\n\n"}

Do you think other countries have judges?\" Trump said. \"We give them, like, trials. That\u2019s the good news. The bad news is, they never show up for the trial.

We have no choice for the good of our country.\"\nTrump\u2019s conversation with Kilmeade centered on immigration, so we wondered if there are \"thousands of judges\" clearing immigration cases.\nFar from it. Fewer than 400 judges currently have this task.\nThere also aren\u2019t that many federal judges who hear other matters. (Immigration is regulated at the federal level.) There are slightly over 1,300 Article III federal judges\u00a0that serve on the\u00a0the Supreme Court, courts of appeals, district courts, and U.S. Court of International Trade. Adding the current number of immigration judges to that count still falls short of \"thousands.\"\nThe White House did not offer data to back Trump\u2019s claim of \"thousands\" of judges, but pointed to remarks he made in April about increasing the number of immigration judges. \"We\u2019re trying to hire thousands of judges,\" Trump said during a roundtable discussion on tax reform.\n\n"}

Zandi is a well-respected economist, one PolitiFact has quoted as an expert in previous fact checks.\nInterestingly, both Clinton and Trump claim Zandi is on the other team.

John McCain during the Arizona Republican\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign.\nZandi\u2019s two analyses project how Clinton\u2019s and Trump\u2019s policies would affect jobs nationwide during a first term: A gain of 10.4 million jobs under Clinton, a loss of nearly 3.5 million jobs under Trump.\n\n"}
{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Julian Assange \"The permission to engage was given before the word RPG was ever used.\"", "evidence": "In an April 12, 2010, interview on The Colbert Report, one of the WikiLeaks founders was pressed to explain why \"Collateral Murder\" was an accurate title for a leaked military video of a 3-year-old deadly encounter between a U.S. Apache helicopter gun crew and a cluster of men on a Baghdad street corner, two of whom were journalists for Reuters.Host Stephen Colbert called the title \"emotional manipulation.\" He noted that while soldiers in the Apache did mistake cameras with long telephoto lenses slung over the shoulders of the two journalists for weapons, there were, in fact, two other men in the group with weapons.\"How can you call it 'Collateral Murder?' \" Colbert asked guest Julian Assange of Wikileaks, referring to the controversial and widely-viewed video.\"So it appears there are possibly two men, one carrying an AK-47 and one carrying a rocket-propelled grenade -- although we're not 100 percent sure of that -- in the crowd,\" Assange answered. \"However, the permission to engage was given before the word RPG was ever used and before the Reuters cameraman, Namir Noor-Eldeen, ever pulled up his camera and went around the corner.\"Assange is referring to a moment in the video when a Reuters cameraman peers from behind a wall, pointing a long telephoto lens. A soldier on the Apache yells \"He's got an RPG!\" According to a military investigation several days later, there were U.S. ground troops less than 100 meters away, and \"due to the furtive nature of his movements, the cameraman gave every appearance of preparing to fire an RPG on U.S. soldiers.\"It's true that that's the first time the word \"RPG\" is uttered by the Apache crew in the unedited 40-minute version of the video. And it's also true that the permission to engage was given prior to that.But that doesn't mean the group of men on the street was believed to be unarmed prior to that, or that U.S. troops were given permission to shoot at a group of what they believed to be unarmed men.Let's walk through some of the early minutes of the the video, and accompanying audio, that comes via an Apache gun camera, to check Assange's claim.When the soldiers spot the group, the gun camera zeroes in on Noor-Eldeen, with the camera slung over his right shoulder. \"There's one, yeah,\" says one of the crew members on the Apache.\"Oh yeah,\" says another. \"That's a weapon,\" the soldier says.\"Yeah.\"Behind Noor-Eldeen is the other Reuters journalist, also with a camera.But then the  cross-hairs in the camera pan to a couple of the other men farther back in the group.\"Yep, he's got a weapon too,\" the soldier says.The soldier radios back, \"Have 5 to 6 individuals with AK-47s. Request permission to engage.\"\"Roger that...You are free to engage. Over.\"At that point, however, the helicopter has apparently circled around, and the group is no longer visible behind a wall. That's when we see the crouching journalist peek around the corner, pointing the camera.\"He's got an RPG!\" a soldier in the Apache yells. Moments later, the Apache circles back around the building, getting the men in full view, and the shooting begins.An investigative report prepared by the military includes several still photos taken from the gun camera video. One shows the two journalists with the cameras, and the report concludes they \"could easily be mistaken for slung AK-47 or AKM rifles, especially since neither cameraman is wearing anything that identifies him as media or press.\" In addition, the report includes a still photo of the men a little father back, the ones who appeared to have prompted the comments \"Yep, he's got a weapon, too.\" Entered as Exhibit B, the investigator placed red circles around what he concluded was two men \"openly displaying an RPG and an AKM, while a third individual carries what appears to be an RPG round.\"Assange agreed on The Colbert Report that it appears one of the men was carrying an RPG launcher, and another an AK-47, but that the video is not entirely conclusive.\nThe military investigative report states that ground troops later discovered two RPGs, an RPG launcher and a rifle where the group had been clustered, and an RPG round under one of the bodies.\nIn an interview with PolitiFact, Assange correctly pointed out that military investigators state definitively that the Apache soldiers had identified men with weapons, \"AK-47s and a RPG,\" though the crew had not actually said the word RPG prior to asking for permission to engage. The report states that men on the street were observed with \"weapons consistent with reports of hostile acts conducted against friendly forces\" and that they had \"satisfied all requirements to initiate an engagement.\"\n\n"}

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Michael Schrunk Says \"under our current sentencing laws, about 75 percent of all convicted felons in Oregon do not go to prison.\"", "evidence": "Gov. John Kitzhaber recently announced the creation of a new commission to examine the state\u2019s sentencing laws. Not long after, two advocacy groups released a joint report calling Oregon's Measure 11 ineffective and discriminatory when it comes to the state\u2019s youth.\n\nMandatory sentencing laws -- ever the point of contention -- are receiving renewed public attention. And in a recent guest column in The Oregonian, three county district attorneys -- including Multnomah\u2019s Michael Schrunk -- offered some context, noting \"this is an issue with which we have great experience and expertise.\"\n\nWhile expressing some disappointment that the governor was not including elected district attorneys on the commission, the three wrote \"contrary to popular belief, we do not lock up every convicted criminal. Under our current sentencing laws, about 75 percent of all convicted felons in Oregon do not go to prison. They are put on probation in the community.\"\n\nThat statistic caught the eye of at least one reader who asked PolitiFact Oregon to take a look.\n\nThe DAs said they got that figure courtesy of Oregon\u2019s Criminal Justice Commission, so that\u2019s where we started.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long before Michael Wilson, the commission\u2019s economist, sent us a breakdown of felons and their sentences for 2010.\n\nAt first blush, it looks like Schrunk and the other DAs -- John Foote of Clackamas and Bob Hermann of Washington -- were right. (It should be noted, nine others endorsed the letter, as well.) Of the 17,622 convicted felons in 2010, just over 4,000 were sent to prison. As a percentage, that\u2019s about 23 percent.\n\nBut, as Craig Prins, the director of the justice commission put it, \"the simple answer isn\u2019t always the most informative answer.\" There are a few caveats to consider before you go shouting that number from any rooftops.\n\nFor starters, that 23 percent figure doesn\u2019t include the 8 percent of felons who serve state time, but do it in local jails. Those 8 percent serve less than a year, but it\u2019s still worth noting. Take that into account and at least 30 percent are serving state time -- just not necessarily in a prison.\n\nNext, it should be noted that there are different categories of felonies, and as you drill down into them, you start to notice that certain sorts of felons are more likely to receive time in a prison.\n\nOf the felons convicted of \"person crimes\" (think: robberies, assaults, sex crimes, murder and others), 43 percent go to prison, and another 3 percent spent time in a local jail. For felons convicted of property crimes, 30 percent wind up in prison and another 5 percent in local jails.\n\nThe overall figure gets pushed down some by drug offenders who are sentenced to prison at a rate close to 8 percent with another 10 percent going to local jails for less than a year. The national rate for the same group is considerably higher, Prins said. In 2006, for instance, nationally drug offenders were being sent to prison about 40 percent of the time, according to a report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\n\"In Oregon, we\u2019ve always kind of prided ourselves on the fact that, policy-wise, it does not make sense to put such people in prison,\" Prins said. Same goes for people who commit lower-level property crimes. Is it worth spending $30,000 to incarcerate somebody who stole $1,000? Prins asked. The priority are those who commit violent crimes.\n\nAnd, indeed, if you exclude drug offenders from the equation, 33 percent of convicted felons serve time in prison while 7 percent serve time in local jails for a total closer to 40 percent.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that drug offenses aren\u2019t felonies -- but it\u2019s still important context, especially given that the word \"felony\" can describe a number of crimes.\n\nThere\u2019s one last bit to consider: About 69 percent of all convicted felons wind up with probation. But that doesn\u2019t mean they get off without serving any time behind bars, which seems to be an implicit part of the DAs\u2019 critique when they note \"contrary to popular belief, we do not lock up every convicted criminal.\"\n\nAccording to Wilson, about 63 percent of the offenders who received a probation sentence in 2010 received a jail sentence as well. The average stay, he said, was just over a month.\n\nPut another way, only 25 percent of convicted felons actually manage to avoid time behind bars as part of their sentence. Even then, Charles French, a deputy district attorney with Multnomah County who deals a lot with crime statistics, said he\u2019d be surprised if those 25 percent don\u2019t serve at least some time in jail, if even a night, after their arrest.\n\n\"I think most people who commit felonies do serve time in jail,\" he said. \"But most of them do not serve time in prison. And, frankly, the idea of a jail sanction as a condition of probation is reformatory, in theory.\"\n\nIt\u2019s important, he added, that the public has access to these sorts of figures, even if they require some context. \"I think the more information the public has, the better.\"\n\nAs for our ruling, the DAs were very specific in their statement that \"75 percent of all convicted felons in Oregon do not go to prison.\" Technically they\u2019re right, but the number of felons the DAs \"lock up\" is considerable higher and that\u2019s an important piece of missing context"}

The story says senators had discussed setting the rate at less than 2 percent of each firm's net income plus its payroll, minus a deduction for each employee.\n\nSo, the initial Senate plan of 2005 had a payroll element.\n\nIn March 2005, the House approved a revenue package that offered companies a choice of paying the existing franchise tax or a 1.15 percent payroll tax on salaries up to $90,000 a year.\n\nDewhurst aired misgivings about the House\u2019s payroll element, according to a March 16, 2005, Express-News news article. The story quotes Dewhurst saying: \"I've said over and over and over again that I think a broad-based, low rate that's based upon revenue and income is fairer than a payroll tax\" which hurts firms with lots of workers. The story says House leaders had said they got around that difficulty by offering companies a choice of which type of tax to pay.\n\nAn April 28, 2005, Dallas Morning News news article, headlined \"Dewhurst lays out tax swap,\" says Dewhurst had \"laid out a preliminary tax swap plan\" offsetting some $4.5 billion in school property tax reductions with various tax increases including a revamped franchise tax extended to virtually all businesses, which would pay about 1.35 percent on after-tax earnings plus, the story says, employee compensation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBut by May 2005, the Senate voted to answer the House with a plan allowing companies to choose the lower of two business taxes, as long as they generated more money than a minimum tax of 0.25 percent of gross receipts -- and the adopted plan retained payroll elements.\n\nThe details are a bit eye-glazing. But as described in a May 12, 2005, American-Statesman news article, the first option for businesses was to pay 2.5 percent of the sum of their net taxable income plus payroll, though they could deduct from the tax base either half of their payrolls or $30,000 per employee plus the cost of some health benefits. The second option in the Senate plan would have required companies to pay a 1.75 percent payroll tax, capped at $1,500 per employee.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAfter the Senate acted, Dewhurst issued a press release praising the action, as Cruz\u2019s campaign has pointed out. Dewhurst\u2019s release includes a paragraph summarizing the tax measure, House Bill 3. \"By closing loopholes, the plan broadens the franchise tax base, and extends a lower rate to all Texas businesses\u2014effectively treating all businesses equally under state tax law. Texas businesses will have a choice of paying either a low-rate revised franchise tax or a payroll tax,\" the release says.\n\nIn that session and a summer session, however, the House and Senate did not reach a compromise, leaving the overhaul of the franchise tax to be resolved in a different way in 2006.\n\nFor outside perspective, we shared the description of the 2005 Senate-approved plan with Richard Pomp, a University of Connecticut law professor who has written extensively on state and local taxation. By telephone, Pomp said he would say the first option in the Senate plan had a payroll tax element, while the second option was a pure payroll tax. \"It doesn\u2019t get any less ambiguous than that, does it?\" Pomp said.\n\nWe contacted Dewhurst\u2019s campaign about this topic and didn\u2019t hear back.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOur ruling\n\nDuring the state\u2019s mid-decade tax debates, the Senate under Dewhurst\u2019s leadership -- and to his praise -- incorporated payroll taxes in a proposal to replace the existing business franchise tax.\n\n"}

Also, Staples\u2019 cited arrest and confiscation totals reflected Drawbridge\u2019s overall results.\nIn an interview, Staples told us his statement was intended to reflect totals for the entire program and he\u2019s never said all the results were due to Agriculture Department aid. Staples also stressed that his email blast said the agency\u2019s savings \"helped\" achieve the results. \"I don\u2019t want to get popped for something I\u2019ve never taken credit for,\" he said.\nOperation Drawbridge\nThe state\u2019s Department of Public Safety started Drawbridge in January 2012, according to its website. DPS spokesman Tom Vinger told us by email that Agriculture Department grants in October 2012 and August 2013 provided $345,000 to the program.\nThe main source of Drawbridge funding, Vinger said, is the Criminal Justice Division of the Governor\u2019s Office, which has so far provided grants totaling $2.5 million.\nA description of the initiative from a June 9, 2012, San Antonio Express-News news story said, \"(T)he department is installing 500 cameras along the border, part of an electronic monitoring program called Operation Drawbridge. It's an update of the much-criticized Texas Border Watch Program, a multimillion-dollar effort by the state to set up video cameras along the border. It was recently canceled after only a few dozen cameras were put in place over more than three years and unimpressive results.\"\nA 2013 DPS conference presentation placed online illustrates how Drawbridge uses modified off-the-shelf, motion-sensing, low-light cameras of the type hunters use to spot and track game at all hours. Farmers and ranchers volunteer to have the $300 cameras placed on their land near the Texas/Mexico border.

His campaign spokesman, Bryan Black, told us via email that Staples helped bring landowner organizations into Operation Drawbridge.\nStaples told us his involvement with border security issues arose in response to landowners asking him for help.\nSavings to buy cameras\nBlack said the grants came from agency savings in fiscal year 2013. Agriculture Department spokeswoman Lindsey Pope emailed us a chart with the agency\u2019s \"lapsed appropriations,\" money budgeted by lawmakers but ultimately unspent, in each biennium from 2006-07 through 2012-13.

We want to go forward.\nThe capital city is generally known for having economic vitality and relative safety.\nSo, let\u2019s check the attack: Walker is claiming that in Madison, businesses have left and murders have gone up, and that Soglin is at least partly to blame.\n(We\u2019ll note: The Wisconsin Republican Party unveiled an anti-Soglin website the same day and made an attack on Soglin similar to Walker\u2019s.)\nBusinesses leaving\nTo back the first part of Walker\u2019s statement, his campaign cited to us two large employers that left the city:\n1. Spectrum Brands, the owner of Rayovac, Remington and other consumer product lines, announced in 2012 it was moving its headquarters and more than 500 employees from Madison to Middleton, a suburb.\nSoglin complained that Spectrum Brands didn\u2019t give Madison a chance to bid on keeping the company in the city. The company said its Madison facility was outdated and not energy efficient, and that it did consider sites in Madison. The company also said the cost savings -- \u00a0along with a $4 million award from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., a state agency under Walker -- \"were substantial enough to shelve plans to move\" to Florida.\n2. Heinz Kraft, the parent company of Oscar Mayer, announced in 2015 it would shut down its 1,000-employee Oscar Mayer plant in Madison. Kraft Heinz said the decision was part of a plan to close seven factories in the United States and Canada, following its merger with Oscar Mayer.\nState Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, a Republican, pointed a finger of blame at Soglin, while Soglin criticized the Economic Development Corp. for not trying to keep the plant in Madison after learning that other states were trying to get the Wisconsin facilities.\nWalker\u2019s campaign also pointed to criticism of Soglin over Oscar Mayer by former Madison Mayor Dave Cieslewicz. But Cieslewicz concluded that the company\u2019s decision to close the plant \"almost certainly couldn\u2019t have been headed off by state or local efforts, even if officials knew it was coming. This appears to be a straightforward business decision that had to do with changes in the industry and the configuration of the aging plant here.\"\nSo, based on news reports of the companies\u2019 own statements, it\u2019s not clear how much of a role, if any, Soglin played in the companies\u2019 decisions.\nMoreover, Walker didn\u2019t provide any evidence that the two cases are anything more than isolated examples.\nWe thought it was important to look at the number of businesses in Madison overall.\nFinding those numbers isn\u2019t as simple as it might appear. These entities don\u2019t count businesses at the City of Madison level: the state departments of Workforce Development and Financial Institutions; the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce and the Greater Madison Chamber of Commerce; and three federal bodies -- the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nThe best count we could find is from the City of Madison assessor\u2019s office, which tracks business that are subject to what is known as the personal property tax, but is only paid by businesses, based on their equipment and furnishings.

Maybe what we need to do is trade in Gov. Jerry Brown,\" of California, \"for Gov. Greg Abbott and get better results.\"\nCastro made a similar declaration in his evening keynote speech, telling delegates: \"This is what happens when a party doesn\u2019t believe in government in the first place but has absolute power over its people for decades. You know, they used to brag that Texas was doing so much better than big bad liberal California. But Texas Republicans managed to bungle that too. Because today California is kicking our butt in job development and economic growth.\"\nCastro\u2019s backup\nWondering how Castro reached his conclusion, we heard back from Manny Garcia, a state party official, who said by email that Castro drew on news stories and government data to find Texas trailing. Garcia also provided what he described as Castro\u2019s personally prepared backup document.\nOver the 12 months starting in June 2015, Castro\u2019s footnoted document notes, Texas added an estimated 171,800 seasonally adjusted jobs, per the Texas Workforce Commission. California from April 2015 through April 2016 reportedly added 450,200 jobs, the document says.\nCastro\u2019s document also declares that California has lately seen greater percentage increases in Gross Domestic Product. Between the first quarter of 2014 and the last quarter of 2015, the Bureau of Economic Analysis announced June 14, 2016, California saw a 4.1 percent increase in GDP, based on national prices for the goods and services produced within each state. Texas\u2019 GDP had gone up 3.8 percent, per the bureau. Also noted by Castro, California\u2019s real GDP grew 2.7 percent from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2015; Texas\u2019s GDP \"only grew\" 1.4 percent.\nCastro\u2019s document further notes that from 2014 to 2015, per capita personal income in California grew by 5.3 percent, according to a March 2016 Bureau of Economic Analysis document. In the same year, per capita personal income in Texas grew 2.4 percent, according to the bureau fact sheet about Texas.\nEconomists comment\nFor our part, we noticed that Castro compared raw changes in jobs over slightly different time periods. Economists we queried agreed the population difference between the states makes raw counts less useful than rate-of-change comparisons. At the time Castro spoke, the latest available U.S. Census Bureau population estimates indicated that as of July 2015, the Golden State was home to 38.8 million people and Texas had 27 million residents--or 30 percent fewer.\nTo compare job gains for each state over a similar period, we turned to Cheryl Abbot, a regional economist in the Dallas office of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By email, Abbot advised that from May 2015 through April 2016, 32 states had statistically \u00a0significant year-over-year increases in nonfarm payroll employment. The largest job gains, she said, were in California, Florida and Texas, with 440,300, 253,900 and 171,800 jobs gained, respectively.\nIn percentage growth, Abbot said, the annual rate of jobs growth for California was 2.8 percent, compared with Texas\u2019 1.5 percent.\nSo, booyah for California?\nWe asked Daniel Hamermesh, an economist at the Royal Holloway University of London formerly employed by the University of Texas, to assess the jobs figures with Castro\u2019s claim in mind. By email, Hamermesh replied that Castro was right for the short term though Texas continues to look better in the long view; from May 2006 to May 2016, the state saw job gains of 18.6 percent as California experienced 8 percent growth, Hamermesh said.\nAfter we downloaded the government\u2019s monthly counts of jobs in each state, we found that as of May 2016, California had experienced greater percentage gains in employment than Texas for every 12-month period going back to 2011. It\u2019s only if you go back further that Texas\u2019s jobs growth exceeds the growth for California.\n\n"}

Tom Graves, a Republican from North Georgia, believes some federal regulations are driving up the costs of transportation here and across the nation. One part of his argument put PolitiFact Georgia on the road in search of whether his complaint is true.\nGeorgia, like most states, is a \"donor\" state when it comes to federal transportation funding, the congressman said.\n\"They spend more in taxes and on red tape than they get back,\" Graves said in his speech, explaining his definition of donor states.\nGraves says Georgians pay more money in gas taxes than the state receives from the federal government for transportation projects once you figure in \u00a0the \"red tape\" from two key federal regulations that have an impact on road construction costs.\nIn the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30, 2012, records show Georgia paid nearly $1.2 billion into the Federal Highway Trust Fund Highway Account and received nearly $1.27 billion from the fund. That would appear to put Georgia in the plus category. But Graves says the irksome regulations of the Davis-Bacon Act and the National Environmental Policy Act add huge costs for the state. Those costs turn the positive into a negative, he said, moving Georgia into the donor category. \u00a0\nGraves and U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah, have put together a solution they call the Transportation Empowerment Act. It would gives states greater authority to determine transportation needs. The legislation would also lower the federal gas tax over the next five years from 18.4 cents per gallon to 3.7 cents per gallon. The states, then, could make up the difference in any way they like \u2014 replace the gas tax, put in toll roads, create a new consumption tax such as T-SPLOST.\nThe federal highway act is up for reauthorization this year, and the two lawmakers hope to race past competing plans with their proposal and get enough votes for adoption.\nGraves said in a recent speech that Georgia is projected to get an 84 percent rate of return this budget year for transportation projects because of these policies. John Donnelly, a spokesman for the congressman, said Graves\u2019 84 percent estimate is conservative.\n\"It is important to note that our calculation is actually generous because it includes the general fund subsidies as well. If we simply calculated the rate of return without a subsidy in play (i.e. gas taxes paid in vs. transportation spending attributable to gas taxes going back to Georgia), we'd be closer to 70 percent. If we then accounted for red tape in that calculation, we'd be closer to 56 percent,\" Donnelly said.\nSo are the Davis-Bacon Act and NEPA a drain on federally funded transportation projects?\nThe Davis-Bacon Act has long been a source of angst amongst conservatives and some business groups. It requires contractors and subcontractors to pay laborers and mechanics working on nearly all federally funded projects at least the locally prevailing wages. It was created in 1931 to prevent employers from hiring cheaper labor during the Great Depression, and it has been amended several times. The wages are determined by the U.S. Department of Labor.\n\n"}

It was as if they had been focus-grouped. Those were hot-button words that had resonance in the revolutionary period after 1918.\n\n\"The reality is, the (Nazi) party could not make inroads into the organized, unionized, working-class electorate in Germany,\" Ledford said.\n\nMay Day was first celebrated as an international day of labor in New York in the 1880s. Hitler made it an official paid holiday, not just a negotiated day off, on May 1, 1933 -- \u00a0and used it to rally for his regime and industrialization. William Shirer (The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich), who was there, called it \"an elaborate piece of trickery.\"\n\nThe next day, on May 2, 1933, unions were dissolved, their assets were confiscated, their offices were occupied and their leaders were arrested. Hitler then outlawed strikes, abolished collective bargaining and established the German Labor Front, a corrupt party organization.\n\n\"It wasn't even a sham labor union,\" Ledford said.\n\nIn Russia, he noted, \"Stalin didn't have to eliminate unions -- Lenin already had.\" And Stalin's first Five-Year Plan converted labor groups into oppressive mechanisms for increasing worker productivity.\n\nMubarak does not belong in the same category as Hitler and Stalin. But his government did routinely suppress worker protests by force.

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Carl Hosticka Says Julie Parrish \"voted to divert $160 million from public schools to private for-profit schools.\"", "evidence": "One of the fiercest legislative fights in 2011 had to do with a bill that loosened enrollment restrictions at online charter schools. It was a battle mostly along party lines and now House Bill 2301 has cropped up in a competitive House race in Clackamas County.\n\nRep. Julie Parrish, R-West Linn, is the freshman incumbent. Her Democratic opponent is Metro councilor Carl Hosticka of Tualatin. In a September guest column published in the West Linn Tidings, he listed a number of Parrish\u2019s many legislative failings -- in his view -- including this one:\n\n\"During this time of cuts in public education, my opponent voted to divert $160 million from public schools to private for-profit schools,\" Hosticka wrote.\n\nParrish asked for a PolitiFact ruling, with this tart remark: \"Online schools are public schools, not private. And I'm not sure where he gets the $160M diverted to for-profit schools as again, while they are contracted out, these are still part of the Oregon public school system.\"\n\nSolid questions. Both major party candidates are claiming to be the education advocate in the race. We plowed on.\n\nThe controversial legislation was approved as part of a compromise deal involving charter school advocates in the House Republican caucus and Gov. John Kitzhaber, a Democrat. What readers need to know for this PolitiFact is that the legislation loosened restrictions on online enrollment, authorizing up to 3 percent of a school district\u2019s population to attend a virtual school.\n\nThere are an estimated 560,000 Oregon public school students in grades K-12, which means the legislation would allow up to 16,000 students to enroll in online academies. However, there\u2019s nowhere near that number in virtual schools; enrollment grew from 4,200 students in the year before the legislation to 5,400 students the year after. Enrollment figures for this fall are not available yet.\n\nIn Oregon, the money follows the student, from the state to school districts, and then from the school district to a traditional school or charter school. For charter schools, the amount is roughly $5,200 a student a year, compared with $6,000 for a student at a traditional school.\n\nThe 5,400 enrollment figure translates into $28 million going to online schools in a single year, 2011-12. That is a fraction of the $160 million estimated over two years, a budget period that Hosticka didn\u2019t clarify in his statement. We do, however, find his $160 million estimate based in fact, since 16,000 students multiplied by $5,200 comes out to $166 million for a two-year period.\n\nSo if the maximum number of students allowed by the legislation were to enroll in online schools, at least $160 million would go toward those online schools over two years. We\u2019ll put aside the question of whether that\u2019s cherry-picking on the part of Hosticka. We want to know whether those schools are \"private for-profit?\"\n\nThe answer is no. By definition, charter schools -- both brick-and-mortar and online -- are public schools. They are sponsored by a public school district, or the state. They use public money to educate students, who pay nothing. (Private schools, on the other hand, charge tuition and can do such things as require students to attend religious services, which a public school could not do.)\n\nWhere does the \"private for-profit,\" language come from?\n\nThere are fewer than a dozen online-only schools in Oregon and most number enrollment in the hundreds, if that. The largest virtual school is Oregon Connections Academy, out of Scio. The school is run by a nonprofit corporation and board, but it\u2019s part of the Connections Academy network, whose parent company is Connections Education, which is now part of Pearson. Connections Education LLC is a private, for-profit entity based in Baltimore, Md. \u00a0\n\nThe second-largest virtual school is Oregon Virtual Academy, out of the North Bend School District, which contracts with K12 Inc.\n\nHosticka stands by his statement that $160 million will be diverted from public schools.\n\n\"She\u2019s trying to hang me on a technicality, whether it\u2019s a public school or a for-profit school. You can make the argument it\u2019s an amalgam of both,\" he said. \"It\u2019s technically a charter school, but then they contract with a for-profit company for education. I\u2019m prepared to stand by this statement that $160 million would end up at for-profit schools.\"\n\nWe ran the statement by various education groups in Oregon, and received two very different responses.\n\n\"In terms of a diversion, absolutely. You\u2019re taking from one pot and putting it in another, taking it from neighborhood schools that are already struggling and passing it to for-profit, private, out-of-state companies,\" said Becca Uherbelau, spokeswoman for the Oregon Education Association, the union that represents school teachers but not the ones at charter schools.\n\nThen there\u2019s Sue Levin, executive director of the advocacy group Stand For Children. She is not an advocate of charter schools or virtual charter schools, and she offers no opinion on their quality. But the schools are part of the public school system.\n\n\"He\u2019s trying to create an impression that in a tight budget, actual dollars were taken out of the state schools funds but that is absolutely not the case. That is misleading, and particularly in the environment that schools are in, it\u2019s pretty inflammatory,\" Levin said.\n\nClearly there\u2019s a wide difference of opinion on what deserves to be part of our taxpayer-paid public school system. There are arguments that online schools are not very effective as well as arguments that they are a lifesaver for children who can\u2019t attend a physical school.\n\nBut Levin, who doesn\u2019t particularly champion them, is right. Like it or not, online charter schools are public schools, so we\u2019re not sure how $160 million can be \"diverted\" from public schools. The money cited is also the maximum amount, should 16,000 children overnight enroll in online classes, which nobody expected to happen and which didn\u2019t happen -- so $160 million is overblown.\n\nHosticka\u2019s statement contains an element of truth, we\u2019ll give him that. The two largest online charter schools in Oregon exist because of private companies that want to make money. But charter school advocates have the Oregon Department of Education on their side: Online schools are public schools"}

He said people are entitled to religious exemptions when it would violate their faith to carry out the duties of their job.\nOn the show, Salcedo characterized the case as such:\n\"I shouldn\u2019t have to give up my career \u2014 make a choice, either give up your career or violate your religious beliefs,\" Salcedo said. \"The government shouldn\u2019t put me in that position.\"\nSaledo\u2019s description of Hensely\u2019s situation is inaccurate. No one is asking Hensley to violate her religious beliefs to keep her career: officiating marriages is an optional activity. A state commission\u2019s opinion on the matter suggested she could officiate all or no marriages, but not selectively choose one type.\nProtection of religious beliefs\nJustices of the peace handle low-level civil and criminal cases, including traffic and other Class C misdemeanor cases and civil cases involving up to $10,000.\nThey can also officiate marriages, but this is considered \"extra-judicial,\" an optional activity that earns them thousands per year in personal income.\nSo while there may be some financial incentive to do it, it is by no means required.\u00a0\nIn fact, some justices of the peace in Texas have chosen not to officiate any marriages in order to avoid the religious dilemma, including in McLennan County, where Hensley hails.\nThe commission decided to investigate Hensley based at least in part on a Waco Herald-Tribune article in which she was quoted about her decision to decline same-sex marriages and how she believed she was entitled to a religious accommodation.\nIt found that she had refused to perform same-sex marriages since 2016, instead only performing opposite-sex marriages and referring same-sex couples to other officiating JPs and clergy.\nThe state commission that sanctioned Hensley said her actions cast \"doubt on her capacity to act impartially to persons appearing before her as a judge due to the person\u2019s sexual orientation.\"\nNow, Hensley can appeal the sanction, start performing same-sex marriages or stop performing marriages altogether.\nHensley has argued that she is entitled to a \"religious exemption,\" but there is no law or legal precedent in Texas establishing such an exemption for a justice of the peace in this context.\nThis question varies by state, depending on whether the state\u2019s Supreme Court has taken up a case and established a precedent.\u00a0\n\n"}

It\u2019s the pathway to better understanding how far the disease has spread, how common severe cases are and how best to address it.\nSo is the president pushing to limit testing?\nA new attack ad from Priorities USA targeting Wisconsin and other battleground states makes that claim with a series of quotes from President Donald Trump. Over the mandatory ominous music, the ad plays four Trump quotes asserting testing is making America look bad, so we should slow it down.\n\n\n\n\nAds in this style have been known to pull quotes out of context or rearrange them chronologically to create a more compelling narrative.\nThat didn\u2019t happen here.\nAmerica has the most confirmed coronavirus cases in the world \u2014 with 2.3 million as of June 24, 2020 \u2014 and has also done the most testing in the world, in terms of raw numbers. Across the nation we are conducting about 500,000 tests per day now, double where we were in early May, according to covidtracking.com.\nThat said, many countries have done more testing on a per-capita basis, as detailed by Johns Hopkins University. Throughout the pandemic the U.S. has averaged about 56 tests per day per 100,000 people. Germany, Canada, Spain and Australia have all tested at a higher rate, and Russia and Qatar are among a handful of countries that have topped 100 daily tests per 100,000 people.\nTrump has boasted of the volume of testing in the past, saying America\u2019s testing is the best in the world and that the high number of confirmed cases is a \"badge of honor.\"\nBut since May, the president has also increasingly pushed back against testing, calling it \"overrated\" and noting the bad optics associated with the higher case counts. He took that line of reasoning a step farther in his latest comments, as detailed in the ad.\nHere are the four quotes in context.\n\u2018By doing all of this testing we make ourselves look bad.\u2019\nTrump said this May 6, 2020, during a meeting with Iowa Gov.

Coons\u2019 assertion that the ACA\u2019s protection for people with preexisting conditions is \"the most important part\" of the law, although it is often mentioned along with the expansion of Medicaid to millions more Americans with low incomes.\nWe started out by contacting Coons\u2019 office to get the background information on his assertion, but didn\u2019t hear back. So, we moved on to examining the statutes and talking to various experts.\nFirst came HIPAA\nWhat we found out is what few people realize: Protections for preexisting conditions for most people with job-based insurance predated the ACA by more than a decade.\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, is best known for its provisions regarding medical privacy and patient access to their medical records. But the principal purpose of the law was to put an end to what was known as \"job lock.\" That happened when people with preexisting health conditions were afraid to leave one job with insurance for another job with insurance because the new insurance would not cover their condition, or would impose long waiting periods.\n\"HIPAA was a big advancement at the time in terms of protecting people with preexisting conditions who had employer coverage,\" said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor who studies health insurance at Georgetown University.\nSpecifically, HIPAA required that as long as someone had been continuously covered by health insurance for at least 12 months, without a break longer than 63 days, new insurance at a new job could not impose waiting periods for a worker or family member. HIPAA also required insurers who sold policies in the small-group market to sell to all small groups, regardless of health status, and to cover every eligible member of the group, also regardless of health status.\n\n"}

(We\u2019re not examining the popularity of the congressmen in question.) The Justice Department does not typically confirm the timeline of grand juries, and the department declined our request for comment on this story.\nOur research is limited to the indictments themselves, as well as public reporting. So far, the available evidence suggests one investigation began during Trump\u2019s presidency. The timing of other is less clear.\nChris Collins investigation\nAll public evidence suggests Collins\u2019 investigation began under Trump, not Obama. What\u2019s more, the charges he faces stem from a phone call made in June 2017, months after Trump took office and his pick to lead the Justice Department, Sessions, was confirmed.\nCollins is accused of insider trading. The charges stem from a phone call he made to his son Cameron to relay closely-held details about an Australian biotech company. Both men held stock in the firm.\nAs a board member of the company, Innate Immunotherapeutic, Chris Collins learned \u2014 before it was publicly known \u2014 that the company had failed a pivotal drug trial.\nHad the drug passed the test, it would have offered a lucrative treatment for a certain form of multiple sclerosis. Instead, the public announcement of the negative results caused the stock price to plummet by 92 percent.\nBut before the results became public, Collins called his son, a shareholder, so that he could dump the stock, the indictment says. Timely trades by the father and son, along with a third defendant, allowed them to avoid losses totaling more than $768,000.\nThat phone call took place in June 2017 \u2014 months after Trump succeeded Obama.\nThe defendants were indicted Aug. 8 in the Southern District of New York. All three pleaded not guilty.\nPreet Bharara, who served as the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 2009 to 2017, until he was fired by Trump, would almost certainly know if the Collins investigation started under the previous administration.\n\"Chris Collins was not an Obama era investigation,\" Bharara tweeted in response to Trump.\n\n"}

Is it possible that the United States could lead other countries on energy production and lead on reducing emissions?\n\u00a0\nMichael Webber, director of the Webber Energy Group at the University of Texas at Austin, said Perry\u2019s claim about oil and gas production is accurate, but his comment on emissions could use some context.\n\u00a0\n\"It\u2019s exciting. Any way you slice that first statement, to my understanding, it is absolutely true,\" said Webber, an author and professor who specializes in energy and mechanical engineering. \"The second statement can be true, but boy, there\u2019s a lot of nuance and caveats around this.\"\n\u00a0\nOil and gas production\n\u00a0\nWe turned to the Energy Information Administration for international data on energy production. The EIA is an independent entity within the Department of Energy that produces data on energy use.\n\u00a0\nEIA spokesman Dennis Mesina declined to comment on Perry\u2019s claim specifically, but provided available data on energy production and emission reductions from countries around the world.\n\u00a0\nOne resource provided by Mesina showed that the United States produced more petroleum and natural gas \u2014 both independently and combined \u2014 than any other country in 2018.\n\u00a0\nIn fact, the U.S. has led on natural gas production since 2011, when it surpassed Russia. In 2018, it surpassed Saudi Arabia in petroleum production, according to the EIA information.\n\u00a0\nBut at the same time, the United States remained the largest energy consumer in 2018 and saw a 3.5% increase in consumption over the previous year, the fastest growth the country has seen in energy consumption in 30 years, according to an analysis of BP\u2019s 2019 Statistical Review of World Energy.\n\u00a0\nThis increase in demand was seen across the world, with China, the United States and India accounting for the most growth, according to the analysis.\n\u00a0\nBut EIA administrator Linda Capuano said the nation\u2019s energy industry is entering a \"transformational time\" in testimony before the U.S. House Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee in February.\n\u00a0\n\"After decades of the United States importing more energy than it exports, EIA now forecasts that our country will become a net energy exporter in 2020,\" she said, according to her prepared comments.\n\u00a0\nRegardless of this prediction, the latest available data shows that the United States produces more oil and natural gas than other countries, as Perry said.\n\u00a0\nReducing energy-related emissions\n\u00a0\nThe second part of Perry\u2019s claim lacks specifics. He did not offer a baseline for comparison or timeline for his claim \u2014 is he looking at year-to-year emissions reductions? Is he looking at reductions over a five-year period?\n\u00a0\nWe can look at different time periods to get a sense of progress, looking at shifts in the past five, 10 or 15 years. But we can also look at emission reductions that occurred during the time period in which the United States led on production of oil and gas, as Perry said in his claim. The U.S. has led on natural gas production since 2011, but has led on production of both gas and oil just since last year.\n\u00a0\nShaylyn Hynes, Perry's press secretary, pointed to a report from the International Energy Agency\u00a0that details the longterm trend of decreasing emissions and also projections for future emissions to decline.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"The US leads the world in actual energy related emissions reductions by orders of magnitude compared to any other country since 2005,\" Hynes said in a statement. \"Yes-there have been ebbs and flows (as there were during multiple years under the Obama Administration) but the overwhelming trend is downward.\"\n\u00a0\nHynes is right that, in\u00a0broad strokes, the United States has reported a\u00a0downward trend in carbon dioxide emissions that has resulted in more carbon dioxide emissions by volume than other nations. But, there's a bit\u00a0more context we need to consider.\n\u00a0\n\"In the end, I think it is true,\" Webber said of Perry\u2019s claim. \"But if I were teaching a class, I\u2019d say that it isn\u2019t that simple and we have more to discuss.\"\n\u00a0\nThe EIA pointed us to global emissions data the agency tracks, which looks at carbon dioxide emissions by country by year, from 1980 to 2016. Carbon dioxide makes up the largest percentage of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\u00a0\nUsing these figures we looked at how the United States has reduced emissions over periods of five, ten and fifteen years (using the most current year of 2016) and how the U.S. compares to other countries.\n\u00a0\n\n*From 2011 to 2016, the United States reduced its carbon dioxide emissions by roughly 273.7 million metric tons, or a 5% reduction.\n*From 2006 to 2016, the United States reduced its carbon dioxide emissions by roughly 738.6 million metric tons, or a 12.5% reduction.\n*From 2001 to 2016, the United States reduced its carbon dioxide emissions by roughly 586.9 million metric tons, or a 10% reduction.\n\nDuring each of these time periods, the United States made the largest reduction in million metric tons of carbon dioxide, but dozens of countries made larger reductions in terms of percentage.\n\u00a0\nAbsolute figures are important to consider, but percentages offer a different perspective when comparing the United States to other nations, since they account for factors like population, economic standing and levels of energy production.\n\u00a0\nThe EIA has not published emissions data from after 2016, but BP\u2019s 2019 Statistical Review of World Energy includes figures up to 2018, which allows for an analysis of emission reductions since the United States has become a leader on both oil and natural gas production.\n\u00a0\nAn aside here: BP has a disclaimer that states its data is \"not comparable to official national emissions data,\" but it is considered a reliable resource by industry experts.\n\u00a0\nFrom 2017 to 2018, when the United States became the leading producer of oil and natural gas, the country saw a 2.6% increase in carbon dioxide emissions. Globally, there was a 2% increase in emissions, the fastest growth the world has seen in seven years, according to the report.\n\u00a0\nHynes pointed to a report from the EIA that forecasted future carbon dioxide emissions \u2014\u00a0although Perry's statement was limited to the present.\u00a0The report predicted that these emissions would decline by 2.3% in 2019 and 0.5% in 2020.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOur ruling\n\u00a0\nPerry said \"The U.S. now leads the world in producing both oil and natural gas, and at the same time reducing energy-related emissions.\"\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s true that the United States is the leading producer of both oil and natural gas as of 2018, but the second part of Perry\u2019s claim needs more context.\n\u00a0\nWhen we step back and look at shifts over the past five, 10 and 15 years, the United States has reduced more total carbon dioxide emissions than other nations, but dozens of others made more reductions in percent-terms.\n\u00a0\nFrom 2017 to 2018, the United States actually increased its carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nWe rate this claim Half True.\n\nHALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\n\n"}

We contacted the fund to ask if it had any additional citations beyond what was in the ad and did not get a response.\n\nFirst, some background about the American Future Fund: It states on its website that it advocates \"conservative, free market ideals,\" and its president is an Iowa state senator. Many of the group\u2019s ads target Obama.\u00a0The New York Times reported that the group was started with seed money from an ethanol executive. The Center for Responsive Politics, which analyzes campaign donations, wrote in 2010 that the American Future Fund received about half of its $23 million from the Center to Protect Patients Rights, a group that gave donations to groups opposed to the federal health care law or abortion.\n\nObama\u2019s vote as a senator and the 2008 campaign\n\nThe ad is correct when it states that while a senator Obama voted in favor of the Wall Street bailout (H.R. 1424) on Oct. 1, 2008. He was one of 74 senators, along with his Republican presidential opponent John McCain, to vote in favor.\n\nThe ad then cites fundraising data from the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group which analyzes campaign donations. We looked at CRP\u2019s data ourselves for the 2008 and 2012 presidential races.\n\nDuring the 2008 campaign, Obama raised about $42.8 million from the finance/insurance/real estate industry -- far above McCain\u2019s haul of about $31.1 million. (FactCheck.org wrote that Obama\u2019s haul was more than George W. Bush\u2019s in 2004 even when adjusted for inflation.)\n\nThe center breaks down that finance/insurance/real estate industry into more detail, including securities and investment, which outreach coordinator Evan Mackinder said would be the most specific way to characterize Wall Street donations.\n\nObama raised about $16 million from the securities and investment industry, while McCain raised about $9.4 million. The ad cites the $42 million figure -- the larger and broader number -- rather than the more specific securities and investment number, but the ad can take some leeway on that point, because it described it as \"Wall Street and financial insiders.\"\u00a0\n\nAfter Obama became president and pushed for financial reform, his relationship with some in the finance sector soured. We found many news reports documenting that tension. Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, founded the investment firm Bain Capital and has had friendly relations with Wall Street and secured millions from those donors. Romney said he would repeal the Dodd-Frank regulations\u00a0and has been vague about other reforms that he would enact to avoid the 2008 financial meltdown.\n\nObama and Romney donations in the 2012 race\n\nThrough April, Romney is in the lead in donations from finance/insurance/real estate and, within that, the securities and investment industry, according to a May analysis written by the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nRomney has raised about $19.2 million from the finance/insurance/real estate including about $8.5 million from the securities and investment industry, according to the center\u2019s analysis.\n\nObama has raised about $8.4 million in the finance/insurance/real estate, including about $3 million from securities and investment.\n\nThat means Romney has raised between double and triple Obama\u2019s haul from the securities and investment sector.\n\nIf we look at the donations proportionally, it would show that the securities sector funded about 3 percent of Obama\u2019s haul and 10 percent of Romney\u2019s. (This doesn\u2019t provide a full picture since the center\u2019s analysis is for donations that were more than $200 a pop -- in the case of Obama that means about $99 million of his $217 million is reflected in the analysis by industry.)\n\nThe analysis shows that the securities/investment industry is the second-largest source of donations for Romney, behind the \"retired\" category. It comes in fifth for Obama, behind retired, lawyers, education and business services.\n\nThe securities/investment donations are even more lopsided for the super PACs: the Restore Our Future pro-Romney PAC raised about about $21 million from that industry while the Priorities USA Action pro-Obama PAC raised about $218,500.\n\nThe center wrote in a March blog post that the ad uses its data to make a misleading point when it states that \"Wall Street sure supports President Obama\":\n\nIn a separate March 2012 article, the center stated that between his campaign committee and a PAC, Romney had received about 72 percent of the near $33 million in Wall Street donations through February.\n\n\"The sheer amount of cash Wall Street has sent Romney represents an extremely lopsided giving pattern. No other presidential candidate, including President Barack Obama, comes close to tapping the motherlode of industry riches. The industry's abandonment of Obama could hardly be more dramatic: Wall Street's preferred candidate in the 2008 race with more than $6 million in industry campaign contributions at this point in the cycle, he has received less than $2.6 million from the industry so far this time around.\"\n\nNews articles cited in ad\n\nThe American Future Fund ad flashes headlines or information from a few news articles. But we found the ad cherry-picked a few of its sources.\n\n\u2022 The ad shows a partial headline from an October 2011 Washington Post story: \"Obama still flush with cash from financial sector.\" The rest of that headline, which was omitted from the ad, stated, \"despite frosty relations.\" The article explains that Obama had raised more from the financial and banking sector than Romney but not when putting aside Democratic National Committee money.\n\n\u2022 The ad cites the headline from a February 2012 Bloomberg article \u00a0\"Obama returns to NYC for Wall Street fundraiser.\"\u00a0That article includes this sentence: \"So far this election cycle, he hasn\u2019t been able to match the success he had four years ago in getting money from Wall Street.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\n"}

Obama's plan is to sneak it in after the November elections to keep it under the radar,\" the e-mail, which was sent to PolitiFact New Jersey on May 12, said. \"This is a 1% tax on all transactions at any financial institution - banks, credit unions, savings and loans, etc. Any deposit you make, or even a transfer within your own bank from one account to another, will have a 1% tax charged.\"\n\n\"If your paycheck or your Social Security or whatever is direct deposit, it will get a 1% tax charged for the transaction,\" the e-mail claims.\n\nDon\u2019t empty your bank accounts and plan a life off the grid quite yet. Neither the president nor his financial team are recommending such a measure, PolitiFact New Jersey found. The idea comes from a Pennsylvania congressman\u2019s proposal.\n\nU.S. Rep. Chaka Fattah, a Democrat, first advanced the concept in the House in 2004 when he introduced a bill that would have required a study on eliminating all federal taxes on individuals and corporations and replacing that revenue stream with transaction fees.\n\nThe bill had no co-sponsors and died in committee. Fattah introduced similar legislation several times after his first attempt calling for a study. Only one of those bills gained a co-sponsor, but none of them made it out of committee.\n\nIn 2010, Fattah ditched the calls for a study and introduced a bill -- called the \"Debt Free America Act\" -- to implement a one-percent transaction fee on \"any transaction that uses a payment instrument, including any check, cash, credit card, transfer of stock, bonds, or other financial instrument.\" \u00a0Any transactions involving stocks were excluded from the fee.\n\nWith the fee, the bill \"intended to raise sufficient revenue to eliminate the national debt\" and \"phase out the income tax on individuals.\"\n\nThe Debt Free America Act is the legislation the e-mail claims Obama and his financial team are recommending, though it\u2019s the work of one congressman and the proposal never left committee.\n\nSince the e-mail, a version of which PolitiFact Rhode Island deemed Pants on Fire in November 2010, started circulating, Fattah reintroduced the legislation.\n\nThe most recent bill, introduced in March 2011, still applies a one-percent transaction fee, but excludes personal bank account transactions in addition to transactions involving stocks.\n\nIt has no co-sponsors and was again referred to committee, where it remains.\n\nOur ruling\n\nAn e-mail claims that the president\u2019s finance team recommends a \"1% tax on all transactions at any financial institution.\"\n\nThat\u2019s ridiculous. A Pennsylvania congressman has sponsored a bill that would levy a one-percent fee on some financial transactions. But nearly every year he has introduced the legislation it gained no support. And none of the bills have ever left committee.\n\nObama -- and his financial team -- have nothing to do with the legislation.\n\nWe set this e-mail claim ablaze. Pants on Fire!\n\n"}

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Barbara Boxer \"Since 1995, the top 400 wealthiest families have seen their incomes go up 400 percent and their tax rates go down 40 percent.\"", "evidence": "During a Sept. 20, 2011, interview with Al Sharpton on MSNBC, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., sought to highlight how America\u2019s richest taxpayers have benefited economically in recent years.\n\n\"The top 400 earners in this country are worth more \u2026 than half of the American people,\" Boxer said. \"And since 1995, the top 400 wealthiest families have seen their incomes go up 400 percent and their tax rates go down 40 percent.\"\n\nWe checked the first part -- that the top 400 tax payers saw their incomes grow by 400 percent -- in March 2010, giving it a rating of True. But the second half of her statement was new to us, so we decided to look into it.\n\nWhen Boxer made her comments, the question of how much the wealthy should pay in taxes was at the top of the national agenda. In remarks on Sept. 19, 2011 about his plan for reducing the federal debt, President Barack Obama said that \"middle-class families shouldn\u2019t pay higher taxes than millionaires and billionaires. That\u2019s pretty straightforward. It\u2019s hard to argue against that. Warren Buffett\u2019s secretary shouldn\u2019t pay a higher tax rate than Warren Buffett.\" (Buffett is the legendary investor who for years has placed high on the list of richest Americans.)\n\nAs we explored elsewhere, Obama is correct that it\u2019s possible for a secretary to pay a higher tax rate than a very wealthy person, but it\u2019s also not typical. In general, wealthier taxpayers do in fact pay a higher percentage in taxes than less-affluent people. The main exceptions are people in Buffett\u2019s category -- the richest of the rich, whose income comes mainly from capital gains and dividends, which are taxed at 15 percent rather than the maximum of 35 percent for wages and salaries, and hedge fund managers, who benefit from a tax code provision that also taxes their earnings at 15 percent.\n\nIn her comment, Boxer explicitly focused on Buffett\u2019s peers.\n\nHer data comes from a periodic Internal Revenue Service report that looks at the income and tax data from the 400 tax returns with the highest adjusted gross income. (In case you\u2019re wondering, these 400 titans aren\u2019t named, and their data is aggregated.) Technically, these aren\u2019t \"families\" necessarily, but for a comment made during a television interview, we think it\u2019s close enough.\n\nWe\u2019ll take Boxer\u2019s two claims in order. The data we\u2019re using, which goes back to 1992, is adjusted for inflation.\n\n\"Since 1995, the top 400 wealthiest families have seen their incomes go up 400 percent.\"\n\nIn 1995, the aggregate adjusted gross income for all 400 tax returns worked out to $17.4 billion, or an average of $43.6 million per return.\n\nBy 2008 -- the most recent year available -- the aggregate income for the top 400 soared to nearly $66 billion, or more than $164 million in adjusted gross income per return.\n\nThat amounts to a 276 percent increase. If Boxer had been using data one year older, she would have been correct: Using 2007 data, the rise was almost exactly 400 percent. This illustrates how sensitive this measurement is to economic conditions.\n\n\"Since 1995 the top 400 wealthiest families have seen \u2026 their tax rates go down 40 percent.\"\n\nFrom the same IRS document, we can see that the average tax rate for the top 400 returns was 29.93 percent in 1995 and 18.11 percent in 2008. That\u2019s a decline of 39 percent -- for our purposes, close enough to Boxer\u2019s claim to be accurate.\n\nOur ruling\n\nOn the data, Boxer is right for one claim and wrong for the other, though on the one for which she\u2019s incorrect, she would have been right using data from one year earlier.\n\nMore broadly, even the smaller, 276 percent increase supports her underlying point -- that for the richest of the rich, incomes have grown by leaps and bounds while average tax rates have declined for the same group by 40 percent.\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted, extrapolating tax-burden patterns from the super-rich (like these 400 tax-paying units) to the merely very rich, the rich or the plain old affluent should be done with care. As the Congressional Budget Office has determined, the tax system is generally progressive, despite the lower tax rates for Buffett and his peers. The poorest one-fifth has an effective tax rate of 4.3 percent, the next fifth has a rate of 10.2 percent, the middle fifth has a rate of 14.2 percent, the second-highest has a rate of 17.6 percent, and the top fifth has a rate of 25.8 percent. And the rates keep going up the higher you climb. The top 10 percent of earners had an effective tax rate of 27.5 percent, the top 5 percent had a rate of 29 percent, and the top 1 percent had a rate of 31.2 percent.\n\nIn other words, the top 400 have a distinctly different tax pattern than even the richest 1 percent of American taxpayers, a much larger group that includes about 1.1 million households with an average pre-tax income of $1.7 million.\n\nStill, Boxer chose her words carefully. She referred to the top 400 taxpayers, and by that standard, her numbers, while imperfect, largely stand up"}

(John) Kasich isn't with us, but I suspect that he's very troubled to know that in Ohio alone, nearly 60,000 disabled citizens are stuck on waiting lists, leaving them without the care they need for months or even years.\"\nIs it true that Ohio\u2019s expanded Medicaid system has sucked up state dollars that could have shortened the waiting list for the disabled in Ohio?\nPence spokesman Marc Lotter said the vice president was saying that \"we need to provide states the flexibility to create systems that best meet the needs of their people.\" Lotter pointed to a Wall Street Journal op-ed that said the more generous federal reimbursement for Medicaid expansion \"diverts resources from the program\u2019s traditional targets.\"\n\"A temporary enrollment freeze might lead Ohio to prioritize resources for the truly needy,\" the piece said.\nWhat we found is that there are about 60,000 people on county waiting lists across Ohio. But Pence is wrong to create a connection between the programs to help them and Medicaid expansion.\nHome and community-based service waivers\nThe waiting list Pence mentioned is part of a 30-year-old effort by Washington to give states more options to keep the long-term disabled out of institutions. It\u2019s called home and community-based services, or HCBS. The money can pay for a variety of services, such as adult day care and assistance at home with eating and dressing.\nStates set the number of people who can apply for waivers and Washington picks up between 50 and 70 percent of the cost. That\u2019s less favorable than the 90 percent share that the federal government pays for Americans who receive Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act expansion.\nHealth analyst MaryBeth Musumeci at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a respected source of health care data, told us there\u2019s no escaping these budget realities.\n\"The expansion adults are a less costly population in that they are generally healthier and therefore use less services than someone on an HCBS waiver who by definition has chronic and long-term care needs,\" Musumeci said.\nBut when Musumeci crunched the data, she found no simple trade-off between expansion and waiting lists.\nIn fact, states that didn\u2019t expand Medicaid were more likely to see their waiting lists grow compared to those that did expand.\n\n"}

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Bernie Sanders In the 2014 election, \"80 percent\u00a0of\u00a0poor people did not vote.\"", "evidence": "Income inequality is the core issue of Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign, and he said it may also be why he\u2019s behind Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary.\nMeet the Press host Chuck Todd asked Sanders why he thought 16 of 17 states with large wealth gaps were won by Clinton.\n\"Well, because poor people don\u2019t vote. I mean, that\u2019s just a fact,\" Sanders said. \"That\u2019s a sad reality of American society. And that\u2019s why we have to transform one, as you know, one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major society of Earth. We have done a good job of bringing young people. But in America today, the last election in 2014, 80 percent of poor people did not vote.\"\nIs turnout among the poor really that low? The data shows that we\u2019ve done slightly better at getting out the vote among low-income people than what Sanders suggests, but not by much.\nSanders\u2019 policy director Warren Gunnels pointed us to a report by the left-leaning policy and advocacy group Demos, which used data from the Census Bureau.\n\"According to Demos, only one in four of those earning less than $10,000 voted in 2014,\" Gunnels said. \"Even worse, the turnout was just 12 percent among 18- to 24-year-olds earning less than $30,000.\"\nIn other words, roughly 75 percent of people in the lowest income bracket didn\u2019t vote in the last midterm elections.\nHowever, there\u2019s one catch to this figure. While an annual income of less than $10,000 is undoubtedly \"poor,\" the poverty threshold in 2014 also includes family incomes above $10,000.\nSean McElwee, a policy analyst with Demos who authored the report, told us to look at annual incomes under $30,000 instead. The turnout rate for that group was 31.5 percent, which means 68.5 percent of poor people didn\u2019t vote in 2014, about 10 percentage points less than what Sanders said.\n\"Sanders is indeed correct to highlight low turnout among the poor as an important factor that biases policy in favor of the wealthy,\" McElwee said.\n\nAs PolitiFact has reported, census data may overstate the turnout rates, as it\u2019s based on self-reporting. So it\u2019s possible that Sanders\u2019 80 percent figure is closer to actual rates than what the survey shows, but this is speculative.\nSanders is more on target if we look at a definition of \"poor\" that is not based on income.\nA 2015 Pew Center survey looked at the politics of financial security, which analysts defined as having a credit card, a savings or checking account, and a retirement or investment plan; not needing to borrow money; not falling behind on bills, rent or mortgage payments; and not receiving food assistance or Medicaid benefits.\n\n"}

No one could point to any statewide data showing the partisan breakdown of newly registered ex-felons.\nFlorida\u2019s voter registration application asks applicants to check a box stating: \"I affirm that I am not a convicted felon, or if I am, my right to vote has been restored.\" But on the form there is no way to separate those whose rights have been restored from those who were never felons.\nA spokeswoman for the Florida Division of Elections told us that it doesn\u2019t have partisan voter registration data for ex-felons.\nThat leaves us with anecdotal reports that may not be statistically representative.\nUniversity of Florida professor Daniel A.

More than 20 states have such laws. \"Stand your ground\" became a hot topic following George Zimmerman\u2019s acquittal, after he claimed self-defense in his 2013 trial for killing Florida teenager Trayvon Martin.\nBut Sullivan\u2019s opponents -- Democrat and Republican -- have challenged his record, saying \"stand your ground\" legislation in Alaska wasn\u2019t his doing.

Every State of the Union address since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks by al-Qaida have included references to this specific jihadist movement.\nWe checked copies of speeches by President George W. Bush and Obama from the American Presidency Project of the University of California Santa Barbara.\nThe Bush speeches\nAs Baier said, the last time we didn\u2019t hear \"al-Qaida\" in a State of the Union-like setting was Bush\u2019s Feb. 27, 2001, \"budget message\" to a joint session of Congress. (Obama\u2019s first speech to Congress in 2009 was also not technically a State of the Union, though it was covered and delivered like one.)\nIn Bush\u2019s 2001 speech, delivered nearly seven months before the day that changed everything, Bush did allude to \"terrorists who threaten with bombs\" as one of the widespread threats of the new 21st century. But he did not mention al-Qaida by name.\nBush\u2019s speech in 2002 was heavily centered on the new war on terrorism in Afghanistan, not surprisingly, but only mentioned al-Qaida once in reference to flight attendants who spotted a man trained by the group and wearing explosives and foiled his attack before Christmas.\nThe group\u2019s name resurged in 2003 as Bush described advances in capturing its leaders and made the case to go after Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein for his pursuit of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and because he \"aids and protects terrorists, including members of al-Qaida.\"\nSubsequent speeches by Bush mainly mentioned al-Qaida in connection with captured leaders or defending the need for the PATRIOT Act\u2019s surveillance programs.\nBush\u2019s last two State of the Unions talked about al-Qaida way more often as the country grew more weary of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was reminding Americans why they were there. There were 10 mentions in 2007 and 11 mentions in 2008, including this excerpt:\nWhen we met last year, al-Qaida had sanctuaries in many areas of Iraq, and their leaders had just offered American forces safe passage out of the country.

As people express their support with the Occupy Wall Street protests, they are citing this chart and similar statistics to show income inequality in the United States.\n\nThe chart -- here\u2019s another version posted on the liberal website Daily Kos -- lists the ratio of CEO pay to average worker pay in the U.S. and nine other countries. The smallest ratio is Japan\u2019s at 11 to 1. The United States is highest at 475 to 1.\n\nWe've gotten many reader requests to check the numbers, in part because the chart lacks any sourcing or additional explanatory information. But despite the lack of backup information, the chart has gone viral.\n\nIt's not only been posted and re-posted many times on Facebook, it's also appeared in countless blogs and been tweeted and re-tweeted on Twitter. \u00a0The chart is the latest reminder that factual claims can spread at lightning speed on the Internet -- even when the facts to back them up are scarce. \u00a0\n\nBefore we check the accuracy of the numbers, it's worth exploring where the chart began and how it went viral.\n\nIt's been repeatedly cited in blogs and reports, including one paper presented at a conference of a United Nations affiliate. The paper, written by Thomas Prosser of the Industrial Relations Research Unit at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom, included the same chart that\u2019s now circulating, which it sourced to a 2005 paper by an M. Kroll titled, \"CEO Pay Rates: U.S. vs Foreign Nations.\"\n\nWe located a scanned version of the paper on the Internet, and it did appear to be written by Prof. Mark Kroll. His institution wasn\u2019t listed, but after some additional searching, we found that Kroll had been teaching at the Louisiana Tech College of Business in 2005 and that he is now the business dean at the University of Texas at Brownsville. But it turns out he didn\u2019t write the paper after all.\n\n\"Actually, I am the \u2018recipient\u2019 of the paper you refer to,\" Kroll told us in an e-mail. \"The paper was done as a class project by three of my students in a graduate class back in 2005. The 475-to-1 ratio that you reference is listed in a table in the paper the students wrote. They do not give a specific citation for the data in the table.\"\n\nThe paper\u2019s cover sheet fooled us -- as it fooled others -- because the professor\u2019s name appears in the middle of the page, and the three students\u2019 names appear together at the bottom in a less prominent spot. We tried to reach the co-authors -- Adam Choate, Dana Rowzee and Jerrod Tinsley, all of whom were working on their Master of Business Administration in 2005 -- but we did not hear back.\n\nSo how about the substance of the chart?\n\nFrom previous fact-checks, we knew that American CEOs are generously paid, and we had confirmed that for ordinary Americans, incomes are stagnating.\n\nBut on the specific comparison of CEO pay and average-worker pay, we found two liberal groups -- the Economic Policy Institute and the Institute for Policy Studies -- that have produced long-running studies of this question.\n\nThe most recent chart from the Economic Policy Institute shows a ratio of 185 to 1 for 2009. According to the group\u2019s calculations, the peak since the mid 1960s was almost 299 to 1. But it was never as high as high as 475 to 1.\n\nMeanwhile, the most recent ratio from the Institute for Policy Studies is also smaller -- for 2010, it was 325 to 1. In previous years the ratio on two occasions has exceeded 475 to 1 -- to be specific, 516 to 1 in 1999 and 525 to 1 in 2000.\n\nThe Institute for Policy Studies\u2019 ratios are higher than the Economic Policy Institute\u2019s due to methodological differences. Sarah Anderson, who has co-authored the Institute for Policy Studies reports, said the figures can vary depending on several factors, including which CEOs are sampled and what types of compensation for both the CEO and the worker are used in the calculation.\n\nStill, both of the years where the CEO pay ratio in the IPS study was at least 475 to 1 came more than a decade ago, so data from those years would be of questionable use to policy debates today.\n\nIn addition, neither of the two groups that compiled these figures made comparisons of CEO-to-worker pay across different countries, as the chart circulating on Facebook does.\n\nSo what we\u2019re left with is an unsourced, undated chart with numbers that, at best, were only correct (approximately) in 1999 and 2000 according to one measure, and wrong according to a different measure.\n\nAnderson of the Institute for Policy Studies said that for a paper written in 2005, a 475 to 1 ratio was not \"crazy high,\" since the figure for 2004 in her group\u2019s study was 431 to 1.\n\nKroll, the professor who graded the paper, added that \"it would not surprise me if (the students\u2019) number was \u2018in the ball park.'\"\n\nStill, that argument doesn\u2019t help today\u2019s social-media posters. The data they\u2019re circulating is at best six years old, and the ratios have fallen since then.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThis is a textbook example of how claims can spiral out of control on the Internet. Just as conservatives have circulated unfounded claims about President Barack Obama's birth certificate, liberals are spreading this questionable chart.\n\nWe don\u2019t doubt the chart\u2019s underlying point that the ratio of CEO pay to worker pay is high in the United States, and is likely higher in our free-wheeling economy than it is in the historically more egalitarian nations of Europe.\n\nBut in its claim that the U.S. ratio is 475 to 1, the chart conveys a sense of certitude and statistical precision that simply isn't warranted -- and which is contradicted by the facts. The latest number for the U.S. is 185 to 1 in one study and 325 to 1 in another -- and those numbers were not generated by groups that might have an ideological interest in downplaying the gaps between rich and poor.

So technically, the definition could be \u2018unidentified.\u2019\n\"We well understood exactly what that was. And when we returned, we debriefed and explained exactly what we had observed. And I felt that this had been distributed to the outside world, the outside audience, and apparently it wasn't, and so many years later, I had the time in an interview to disclose these observations, on another country's television network. And the UFO people in the United States were very very angry with me, that I had not given them the information. It was not an alien. Extraordinary observations require extraordinary evidence. That's what Carl Sagan said. There may be aliens in our Milky Way galaxy, and there are billions of other galaxies. The probability is almost CERTAIN that there is life somewhere in space. It was not that remarkable, that special, that unusual, that life here on earth evolved gradually, slowly, to where we are today.\n\n"}

There is no game plan.\u201d", "evidence": "Scientists have expressed cautious optimism that a vaccine will be ready in the spring of 2021 (and President Donald Trump has hinted at an even more aggressive timeline). But that has raised a key question: Does the federal government have a plan to distribute it?\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden says no.\u00a0\n\"If the vaccine came out tomorrow, how in the heck would we get it to people? There is no game plan they have,\" Biden told associations that represent Black and Hispanic journalists Aug. 6. \"How would everybody in America have access to it? It is a gigantic problem to distribute, even if we have it, and that\u2019s what we should be planning for now, not when we get it.\"\nThe federal government has not yet released a plan about how it will distribute vaccines. But in the past two weeks, federal officials have spoken about vaccine distribution planning, including the role of the Defense Department. And committees are working on recommendations about how to distribute the vaccine, while the CDC asked a few to join a pilot program to plan for distribution.\n\"There is no national COVID-19 vaccination distribution plan, yet. So that is true,\" said Michael Fraser, CEO of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.\nMost of the experts we spoke with said the government\u2019s efforts have been too slow, and states face too many unknowns to do their part in planning to vaccinate millions of people.\u00a0\n\"This is going to be the most challenging, complex mass vaccination program ever attempted,\" said Dr. Kelly Moore, who works at the Immunization Action Coalition and ran Tennessee's H1N1 vaccination program.\nTwo committees working on recommendations\nIt\u2019s not yet known precisely when the vaccine will be available to the public. Six vaccines are in the third phase of testing that involves thousands of patients. Like earlier phases, this one looks at the safety of a vaccine, but it also examines effectiveness and collects more data on side effects.\nResults of the third phase will be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration. After the FDA licenses the vaccine, recommendations will be given about who should get the vaccine, and distribution will follow, said Dr. Carol Baker, a pediatrician who is an alternate liaison to a COVID-19 vaccines working group.\nFederal health officials have generally predicted that the vaccine will be available in early 2021.\u00a0\nThere are two committees working on recommendations for the CDC about vaccine distribution.\nThe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a long-standing committee at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, formed a COVID-19 vaccines working group in April. The group\u2019s next meeting on Aug. 26 will be publicly live streamed. Recommendations about who should get the vaccine first are expected by the fall.\nThe committee has wrestled with questions about whether to prioritize groups who have been infected at higher rates, such as Black and Latino people. Another difficult question is defining who is an essential worker.\u00a0\n\"There is no right answer there,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University, a liaison to the working group. \"Grocery store workers vs. long haul truckers vs. people who work to keep the electrical grid up ... you can go on and on. Your priority list is valid, but so is mine.\"\nIn July, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and the National Academy of Medicine formed a committee to help make a plan for vaccine distribution.\u00a0\nSome experts told us it\u2019s unclear why there are two separate committees working on the same task, while others said the CDC group will be the key group to make recommendations to the CDC.\n\nDefense Department role\nOne key question has been about Trump\u2019s comments that the military would be involved with logistics of vaccine distribution, a first.\nTrump told reporters July 28 that the military is \"all mobilized. It\u2019s been fully set up. When we have that vaccine, it will be discharged and taken care of. It\u2019ll be a very rapid process all over the country.\"\nBut a McClatchy report the next day cast doubt on Trump\u2019s statements. Two defense officials told McClatchy that the military commands most likely to be involved in a delivery strategy had not been asked to prepare one. A Health and Human Services official told McClatchy that military help may not be required at all, and it would be the exception, not the norm.\n\n"}

{"label": "false", "claim": "Austin Scott Said U.S. Rep. Jim Marshall, D-Macon, sent nearly $2 billion overseas to build wind turbines and create jobs, mostly in China", "evidence": "Your stimulus money is being shanghaied, Republicans are saying. Literally, it's going to China.\n\nAnd credit belongs in part to Democratic U.S. Rep. Jim Marshall, according to a recent TV commercial by his Republican opponent, Austin Scott.\n\nThe attack claims Marshall, from Macon, voted for the stimulus bill, which \"sent nearly $2 billion overseas to build wind turbines and create jobs, mostly in China.\"\n\nU.S. stimulus money went to China? To create jobs there? AJC PolitiFact Georgia took a look.\n\nMarshall spokesman Doug Moore said the claim is wrong.\n\n\"There is just no evidence to support the claim that jobs were created in China,\" Moore said.\n\nMarshall and Scott are in one of the state's toughest races. Marshall, the incumbent since 2002, has a record of fending off serious challenges. But this season, Democrats are struggling and victory is far from assured.\n\nSimilar accusations about China and wind power are haunting Democratic congressmen in Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, New Mexico, Ohio and Virginia. They, like Marshall, voted for the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009, otherwise known as the stimulus bill.\n\nRepublicans are attacking the stimulus because they think it was squandered. And that's where China comes in.\n\nPolitiFact National assessed a similar claim in February on wind turbines and China by former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. She said the stimulus bill was supposed to help create U.S. jobs, but 80 percent of the $2 billion in stimulus dollars spent on alternative energy went to buy wind turbines built in China.\n\nThe stimulus did include tax credits and grants to help investors develop wind and other alternative-energy projects in the U.S. But beyond that, Palin's claim fell apart.\n\nBefore the stimulus, the federal government gave tax credits to investors in U.S. alternative-energy projects. A program created by the stimulus bill lets the investors get that money up front if they meet certain conditions. But there was no requirement that equipment used in those projects be made in the U.S. or that the investment companies be American-owned.\n\nIn October 2009, American University's nonprofit Investigative Reporting Workshop published stories that said much of this program's stimulus money for wind projects ended up in the hands of foreign firms. Although the projects were located in the U.S., many were being built by American subsidiaries of foreign-owned companies, reported Russ Choma, a reporter at the workshop.\n\nIn February, the workshop ran additional stories in partnership with ABC News and the Watchdog Institute at San Diego State University. By that time, about 79 percent of the $2.1 billion given to wind-energy companies had gone to foreign ones.\n\nSo Palin's claim did address a real controversy, but she misrepresented it.\n\nSome of the stimulus money supports jobs abroad because turbine parts are often made overseas. But many are made by U.S. companies or made by foreign companies in the U.S. Not a single recipient of program money is owned by a Chinese company.\n\nBack to Scott's commercial, which makes a claim that's slightly different from Palin's. It said that the stimulus sent nearly $2 billion overseas to build turbines and create jobs, mostly in China.\n\nThere are a few problems with this accusation.\n\nThe first is that it uses the $2 billion figure incorrectly. The amount, which is from the February stories, was the total for wind grants -- including domestic ones. About 79 percent of that money went to foreign-owned companies.\n\nSecondly, the $2 billion number is outdated. Because claims about jobs in China and wind turbines began to re-emerge recently, Choma posted updated stimulus figures Sept. 27. on the workshop website.\n\nMajor wind farm projects in the U.S. received $4.4 billion worth of grants under the program, according to more recent calculations based on U.S. Department of Energy numbers. About $2.38 billion, or 54 percent, has gone to foreign-owned developers.\n\nThird, the commercial's claim that the $2 billion got sent \"overseas\" is well short of correct. Although equipment was made overseas and foreign companies were involved, much of the money was also spent domestically. Every one of the projects was located in the U.S., and some of the turbines were manufactured here.\n\nHow much money stayed here? Experts said it's difficult to tell. But the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California used Energy Department funds to study the grant program's impact, including its effect on jobs.\n\nThe lab's calculations were rough, early estimates based on limited information and do not take into account nonwind-energy jobs lost because of the program. But its economic model showed wind projects funded by the grant program created or retained more than 55,400 domestic jobs, most of them short-term.\n\nIf the project were entirely domestic, it would have created more than 87,000 jobs, the report said. However, this was not possible. The U.S. does not have the capability to manufacture enough wind turbines, it noted.\n\nAnother estimate based on research from the Renewable Energy Policy Project, which has been critical of how the Obama administration handled the stimulus grants, indicates the projects created a total of 35,000 jobs.\n\nBut it's not clear how many jobs would be overseas. Too few are domestic, the group said, and the program doesn't do enough to foster the development of U.S. wind turbine manufacturing.\n\nUnlike the lab's calculations, the REPP number does not include \"induced\" jobs, or jobs supported when workers and firms spend the money they make.\n\nRegardless, these job estimates indicate money did stay in the U.S. Although turbine manufacturing does take place overseas, some takes place domestically, and the construction and operation of the sites take place in the U.S.\n\nAnd finally, the most important problem with Scott's claim is China. It's barely a factor in this debate.\n\nA wind industry trade group that's been critical of how Choma and others portray the issue confirmed that only three turbines were purchased outright from China. Not a single company that received these funds is owned by a Chinese company.\n\n\"When we talk about money going overseas, it's going to Europe,\" Choma said.\n\nSo while the green-energy grants did end up in the hands of foreign companies, the situation is far from what Scott's commercial claimed.\n\nThe $2 billion figure is old and incorrect. Even critics agree that money is staying in the country in the form of domestic construction and manufacturing jobs, though the amount is unclear and most jobs are short-term.\n\nIt's not possible for domestic manufacturers to produce all the wind turbines because they don't have enough capacity. And the overseas jobs in question are mostly in Europe, not China"}

John Kasich as the Republican nominee for president. PolitiFact rated the claim Half-True. Here's why:\nTo put that $1 trillion number in perspective,\u00a0the national debt\u00a0has reached nearly $19.2 trillion, or more than $60,000 for\u00a0every man, woman and child\u00a0in the United States.\nPolitiFact has looked at the\u00a0presidential candidates' tax plans\u00a0and, for the Clinton proposal, we relied on\u00a0a March 3, 2016, analysis\u00a0by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank.\nThe center says that Clinton's proposal would indeed increase tax revenue by $1 trillion \u2014 $1.1 trillion in fact.\nBut that money would be raised over 10 years. Clinton, even if she were elected in November and reelected in 2020, wouldn't be in office that long.\nReagan's message on behalf of New Day misses another point that may make the increase less onerous to most voters: \"Nearly all of the tax increases would fall on the top 1 percent; the bottom 95 percent of taxpayers would see little or no change in their taxes,\" according to the report.\nFor example, filers with an adjusted gross income higher than $1 million would have to pay an effective tax rate of 30 percent. Any money earned above $5 million per year would be assessed an extra 4 percent surcharge. (The surcharge would kick in at $2.5 million for married couples filing separately.)\n\n"}

The law is losing support, she said.\n\"The numbers of people that support Obamacare and like it have been steadily dropping,\" she said. \"The latest Wall Street Journal polls show that.\"\nPunditFact wanted to know if Cheney\u2019s point is accurate.

We already know from PolitiFact\u00a0that a sizable share of Americans want the health care law repealed, but they do not increasingly want it repealed.\nWe wanted to look at the evolving support and opposition for the health care law, and not just from the Wall Street Journal.\nSites like Huffington Post Pollster and Real Clear Politics offer averages of several polls to give readers an idea of the public\u2019s changing views of the law since its infancy. It\u2019s not a perfect way of looking at the data, as the survey questions are not identical and the polls vary in size.\nStill, the polling aggregators don\u2019t show steadily falling approval ratings for the law.\nAccording to a Real Clear Politics average of nine major polls from March 16-31, 40.4 percent of Americans favor the law and 52 percent do not. This is less than 2 percentage points shy of the favorability mark for much of March a year ago, and down a bit from a recent high of 42.6 percent at the end of October (the highest average on Real Clear Politics was 43 percent in June 2010). As problems with the online insurance marketplaces mounted last fall, approval for the law fell, hitting 36.9 percent in December. Approval ratings since have spurted up and down to their most recent place. See the chart.\nHuffPost\u2019s Pollster shows a similar trend\u00a0in its aggregration.\u00a0The most recent average for people who favor the health care law is 41.2 percent, down from 42.1 percent in October but up from 38.1 percent in December. After the health care law passed in March 2010, poll averages hovered between 40 and 43 percent for the rest of the year before falling off a bit.

One bank in the country.\"", "evidence": "At an appearance in Concord in mid-April, former Florida governor Jeb Bush talked banking -- and the legislation meant to reform it.\n\"On my last trip to New Hampshire I think I met the guy who founded the first and only bank since Dodd-Frank passed, since the financial crisis,\" Bush said at his speech at Saint Anselm College\u2019s Politics and Eggs event April 17. \"One bank in the country.\"\nThe banking reform legislation known as Dodd-Frank became law on July 21, 2010, nearly five years ago. We decided to look into Bush\u2019s statement that only one bank had been founded since that time.\nWe checked with Bush\u2019s camp and according to spokesman Matt Gorman, Bush met with businessman Bill Grenier when he was in the state March 14. Greiner, of Bedford, filed last year with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to charter an entirely new bank named Primary Bank.\n\"We\u2019re going against the grain, and we\u2019re okay with that because we see a need,\" he told the Wall Street Journal in December.\nSo would Primary Bank be the nation\u2019s \"first and only\" since Dodd-Frank? Not exactly. Depending on the data set you choose, it\u2019s either the second, fourth, ninth or 20th.\nThe Journal \u00a0and other media sources have said the first bank founded after the law\u2019s passage is in fact the Bank of Bird-in-Hand, Pa. It mainly serves the area\u2019s Amish community. And yes, it includes a drive-through window for horse-and-buggy.\nThis was included in the information forwarded to us by Bush\u2019s spokesman.\nBut we decided to ask the FDIC itself. Greg Hernandez, an agency spokesman, offered further details. First, off, when Bush and others talk about new banks, they\u2019re referring to de novo banks, or banks issued a new charter by the agency.\nNot counting Grenier\u2019s startup, the FDIC actually lists three banks issued charters since 2010. The oldest, Lakeside Bank of Lake Charles, La., had its charter approved in October 2009, before Dodd-Frank\u2019s passage. But the charter wasn\u2019t consummated until late July 2010, after the bill was signed into law.\nThe next bank on the FDIC\u2019s list is Start Community Bank of New Haven, Conn. While its charter was approved in December 2010, the bank itself says its origins date to 2004, with the founding of its parent company.\nThe Bird-in-Hand bank\u2019s charter was both approved and consummated in November 2013.\nIt seems fair to call Primary Bank the second of all-new bank approved by the FDIC since Dodd Frank\u2019s passage. But if you include the two others that the agency itself lists, Primary Bank would come in fourth.\nThe FDIC lists five other banks as having been established since mid-2010, including one in Kansas City, Mo.; Brockton, Mass,; and Easley, S.C., according to Hernandez. These banks, however, didn\u2019t apply for new charters.\n\"Other banks can be established through a shelf charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,\" Hernandez wrote in an e-mail. \"That would be when a private equity group purchases a failed bank. Also, (newly) established banks can be the result of a merger or acquisition.\"\nIf you use that criteria, and include the five other banks mentioned, Primary Bank would be the ninth bank started after Dodd-Frank.\nAnd finally, while they\u2019re not called banks and are regulated by a different agency, consumers generally see credit unions as the equivalent of banks (and credit unions are affected by the law, too). According to John Fairbanks of the National Credit Union Administration, there have been at least 11 credit union charters approved since the start of 2011. That would make Primary Bank at least the 14th and at most the 20th such institution started since Dodd Frank overhauled the banking industry.\n\n"}

I'm fighting for the vets. I've done a lot for the vets,\" Trump said on July 19. \"He's done nothing to help the vets.

Trump wrote: \"Thanks to McCain and his Senate colleague Bernie Sanders, their legislation to cover up the VA scandal, in which 1,000+ veterans died waiting for medical care, made sure no one has been punished, charged, jailed, fined or held responsible. McCain has abandoned our veterans. I will fight for them.\"\nIs Trump correct that that McCain -- a Vietnam prisoner of war and current chairman of the Senate Armed Services committee -- hasn\u2019t helped his fellow veterans?\nThe Trump campaign never got back to us, but McCain\u2019s office did, and, not surprisingly, they begged to differ. They provided a wide variety of examples of things McCain has done for veterans during his nearly three-decade congressional career. Here are a few of the most recent ones:\n\u2022 Military families. In June 2015, McCain co-sponsored an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act of 2016 to cover the travel costs for the family of troops killed in overseas missions. The amendment was adopted by the Senate by unanimous consent.\n\u2022 Veterans health. McCain introduced the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act in early 2015 to increase access to mental health support for veterans. It has become law.\n\u2022 Department of Veterans Affairs. In 2014, McCain -- along with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Democratic presidential candidate -- led efforts to address the scandal over secret waiting lists at VA hospitals by pushing the The Veterans\u2019 Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act all the way to enactment. In 2015, McCain co-sponsored a bill to increase accountability at the department.\n\u2022 Non-legislative support. McCain\u2019s office employs five caseworkers solely dedicated to helping veterans who are running into problems at the Department of Veterans Affairs. A spokeswoman told us McCain\u2019s office has handled more than 2,000 veterans-related cases in 2015 alone.\nWe also reached out to veterans groups.

However, we found that a different type of group is supporting her in similar ways.\nThe terminology can be confusing, so let\u2019s clarify the definitions.\nPolitical action committees, or PACs, are vehicles for politically active individuals to pool their money and spend it in political campaigns. There are dollar limits on how much individual donors can give to a PAC and how much PACs can spend on behalf of a given candidate.\u00a0\nA \"super PAC,\" by contrast, has fewer restrictions. Super PACs, which proliferated after the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in the Citizens United case, can raise and spend unlimited amounts, as long as they don't directly coordinate with candidates or party committees. Super PACs are often, though not always, established and run by a candidate\u2019s former close aides.\nSuper PACs, like regular PACs, publicly disclose their receipts and expenditures to the Federal Election Commission, though they sometimes get big donations from nonprofits, which don't have to disclose their donors. So tracking super PAC funding sources still leaves gaps.\nWe\u2019ll note that Warren didn\u2019t say \"super PAC\" in her debate claim, but she clarified in a subsequent tweet that that\u2019s what she was referring to.\nWho does Warren say has a super PAC?\nWhen we checked with the Warren campaign, they provided a list of candidates on the debate stage in New Hampshire.

Ted Cruz told the Conservative Political Action Conference on March 16, 2013.\nIn his keynote speech at the event (commonly known as CPAC) held annually by the American Conservative Union, the Texas Republican equated current events to Democrats telling the Catholic Church, \"Change your religious beliefs or we'll use our power in the federal government to shut down your charities and your hospitals.\"\nReading that as a reference to the administration of President Barack Obama, we asked Cruz\u2019s office for backup information.\nCruz spokesman Sean Rushton, saying Cruz also was referring to congressional Democrats who voted for the health care overhaul known as Obamacare, emailed us links and articles from conservative and religious sources criticizing government decisions on how churches and affiliated organizations are to comply with the law\u2019s mandate that insurance plans cover preventive care -- including an administration interpretation that this includes birth control without employees paying any out-of-pocket costs.\nNone of the articles Rushton sent, though, showed Democrats or the government saying they would shut down churches\u2019 hospitals or charities for failing to comply.\nA Feb. 10, 2012, PolitiFact story gave the backdrop: 2010\u2019s health care overhaul required most health plans to cover recommended \"preventive health services\" without co-pays or deductibles. But the law left to the administration to decide which women\u2019s health services to include.\nIn August 2011, the Department of Health and Human Services ruled that insurance plans would have to cover sterilization and all birth control approved by the Food and Drug Administration, from condoms to hormone shots to \"morning-after\" pills, starting in August 2012 at the earliest.\nBut according to Catholic precepts, contraception is against moral law. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops says that if contraceptives must be offered without a co-pay, that means the cost is spread among employers and all insured employees -- meaning that Catholics would end up paying for birth control.\nThose rules were finalized in 2012, and more changes have been proposed as of 2013, amid much public debate.\nIn the 2012 rules, which are still in force, the government exempted some religious employers and gave them a year\u2019s grace period before the requirements took effect.\nTo qualify for the \"religious employer\" exemption, a group had to be a nonprofit that served and employed people who shared its religious tenets and had as its purpose inculcating religious values.\nBut the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the governing body of the Catholic Church in this country, said that definition was too narrow because it ruled out many universities, hospitals and charitable groups, such as those that serve non-Catholics.\nChanges that the government proposed Feb. 1, 2013, would widen the definition of \"religious employer\" and, according to a Reuters news story posted that day, require that arrangements be made for people who work for self-insured religious organizations to get contraception coverage through private insurers.\nRushton said the proposal did not go far enough and sent us material from the conservative Heritage Foundation including a Feb. 9, 2013, article saying that the \"so-called fix would only apply to certain religious nonprofit organizations, leaving many others \u2014 such as business owners, individuals, and non-religious nonprofits \u2014 without any recourse from the mandate.\"\nBishops\u2019 spokeswoman Sister Mary Ann Walsh told us by email that \"massive fines for non-compliance\" would force some groups to close, and the proposed changes would not fix the situation.\n\"If they fail to provide coverage for contraception or sterilization in their health plans,\" Walsh wrote, \"they\u2019re subject to an assessment of $100 a day per employee. ... And if they drop their health plans to avoid the mandate, they\u2019re subject to an annual penalty of $2,000 per employee,\" she wrote, citing the sections of U.S. law that spell out the fines: 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980D(b) and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980H(a), (c)(1).\n\n"}
{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Cory Mason Says Wisconsin Assembly Republicans voted to repeal a law that ensures \"that women cannot get paid less than a man for doing the same job.\"", "evidence": "A bill awaiting action by Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker would take away the right of discriminated workers to sue employers in state court for compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nThe GOP-sponsored bill would reverse a right to sue granted in a 2009 law approved when Democrats controlled state government. It covers many types of discrimination, including age and race.\n\nBut in criticizing his Republican colleagues for approving the new bill, state Rep. Cory Mason, D-Racine, issued a news release on Feb. 23, 2012 that focused on women.\n\nHe said the bill would repeal a law that ensures \"that women cannot get paid less than a man for doing the same job.\"\n\nThere\u2019s no debate that the bill would repeal the right to sue contained in the 2009 law.\n\nBut would it also affect working women the way Mason says?\n\nTo explore how employment discrimination cases work, we spoke with two employment law experts, Milwaukee lawyers Jeff Hynes, who represents workers, and Scott Beightol, who defends employers.\n\nThere are two routes to filing an employment discrimination complaint: the state Equal Rights Division and the federal Equal Opportunity Employment Commission.\n\nIf workers prove discrimination using the state system, an administrative law judge can \"make them whole\" by ordering the employer to pay back pay with interest, legal fees and job reinstatement, if there was a termination. If the discrimination is proved in the federal system, often a \"make whole\" settlement is reached through mediation.\n\nIn either system, discriminated workers can collect larger sums of money from an employer -- compensatory and punitive damages -- only by suing.\n\nA federal lawsuit has long been an option, but suing employers in state court for compensatory and punitive damages only became possible with the 2009 law adopted by the Democrats. That law is new enough, and discrimination cases take long enough to process, that no such state lawsuits have yet been filed. Under the current law, if such lawsuits are brought in state court, workers could collect as much as $300,000 in damages, depending on the employer\u2019s size. (The employer must have at least 15 employees.)\n\nSupporters of the 2009 law said at the time it was needed to enforce laws that require men and women to be paid equally and to deter employers from committing discrimination. Opponents said the law creates an unnecessary burden on businesses when workers already had legal avenues to collect damages for suffering discrimination.\n\nFast-forward to the GOP bill, promoted as a pro-business measure, that Walker\u2019s spokesman said the governor is reviewing.\n\nWould it, as Mason claims, repeal a law that ensures \"that women cannot get paid less than a man for doing the same job\"?\n\nMason argues the law ensures equal pay for women because filing lawsuits is the major way of enforcing civil rights laws. The threat of being sued in state court makes employers less likely to discriminate against workers, which also helps ensure pay equity, he added.\n\nBut ensuring the right to sue in state court, as the law does, is not the same as ensuring pay equity.\n\nMason also said there is an indication the \"pay gap\" between men and women in Wisconsin has decreased since the 2009 law took effect. He cited a 2009 study and a 2010 study by the American Association of University Women, which advocates for equity for women and girls. Using median annual earnings for full-time workers, the studies found that Wisconsin women earned 75 percent of what men did in 2009, ranking the state 37th; and 78 percent in 2010, ranking the state 25th.\n\nMason acknowledged, however, that the studies aren\u2019t proof that the law caused the decrease in the pay gap. More importantly, the studies were an overview of pay -- they didn\u2019t examine pay for women and men who do the same job, which is what Mason\u2019s claim addressed.\n\nWhat about the experts?\n\nHynes said the 2009 law deters discrimination because it is easier and less expensive to bring a workplace discrimination suit in state court than in federal court. If the GOP bill becomes law, he said, it would be harder for discriminated workers to collect damages and therefore harder to enforce laws prohibiting unequal pay.\n\nBeightol disagreed that the federal system is more onerous and argued that discriminated workers have the same remedies available through federal court that they do in state court. He also made the point that no lawsuits have been filed in state court since the 2009 law took effect.\n\nOur rating\n\nMason said Wisconsin Assembly Republicans approved a bill to repeal a law that ensures \"that women cannot get paid less than a man for doing the same job.\"\n\nThe law does not ensure pay equity, but rather gives discriminated workers the right to sue in state court for compensatory and punitive damages. So, if the GOP-backed bill is signed into law, that right to sue would be lost.\n\nBut discriminated workers would still be able to seek back pay and other \"make whole\" payments through government agencies, and they could still sue for compensatory and punitive damages in federal court"}
{"label": "true", "claim": "AFL-CIO Republican redistricting plans cut Democrat Nancy Nusbaum out of\u00a0 \"her state Senate district by a half a block.\"", "evidence": "Redistricting is required by law every 10 years to adjust districts to account for population shifts. In Wisconsin, the past several redistrictings have been done by the courts because legislators couldn\u2019t agree on new borders.\n\nThis year is different because, for the first time in decades, one party controls both legislative branches and the governor\u2019s office -- Republicans.\n\nDemocrats and their supporters say the GOP maps are aimed at protecting the party and undermining Democratic chances. What\u2019s more, they say the new maps are being rushed through the Legislature in case the Senate flips hands during the August 2011 recall elections.\n\u00a0\nUnder the Republican maps, 11 pairs of lawmakers in the two chambers from both parties wind up in the same district and will be forced to run against each other. Several key Democratic state senators -- or candidates in the recalls -- are drawn out of their current districts.\n\nIn a blog post, the state AFL-CIO cried foul:\n\n\"These maps are so ludicrous that Nancy Nusbaum (D) and Fred Clark (D) won\u2019t even be in their districts any more if the changes go through. They cut off Nancy\u2019s house from her district by half a block!\"\n\nThe group adds that the new districts \"are rigged so that when the people of Wisconsin reclaim their democracy in the August recall elections, Republicans will be able to sneak back into office in 2012 via GOP-favored districts.\" \u00a0\n\nThere have been plenty of instances where elected officials have been forced to choose between their seat or their house. Often it\u2019s part of a downsizing of the legislative body -- such as when a state loses a congressional district or a county board slims down.\n\nBut what about the Nusbaum part of this claim? A half a block out of the district?\n\nLooking into it provides some insight into the redistricting process.\n\nNusbaum is the Democrat challenging Sen. Robert Cowles (R-Green Bay) in the Aug. 9, 2011, recall election for the 2nd District seat. If the maps, as proposed, become law, Nusbaum would be a resident of a different senate district -- the 30th. That seat is now held by Sen. Dave Hansen (D-Green Bay), who prevailed in a recall election July 19.\n\nIn short, Nusbaum could win the battle with a victory over Cowles.\n\nBut she\u2019d lose the war by having to either move or run against Hansen.\n\nNusbaum lives at 1319 N. Summer Range Rd. in De Pere, a suburb of Green Bay.\n\nThe new district\u2019s border would be Webster Ave., a thoroughfare that runs just east of Nusbaum\u2019s home. Her house is three homes from the intersection.\n\n\"I used to be right in the middle of this district,\" Nusbaum said, who has lived in the home for 26 years.\n\nNusbaum, a former mayor of De Pere and former Brown County Executive, said she was well aware of the politics of redistricting. She notes that the new map splits her city into two Senate districts, something that hasn\u2019t sat well with local leaders.\n\n\"I think it\u2019s because of me, and I\u2019m sorry,\" she said. \"I think its blatant the way they cut me out of this district.\"\n\nWe tried to reach Republicans involved in the drawing of the new Senate districts. Attorney Jim Troupis, whose office was involved in the work, didn\u2019t return a call. Andrew Welhouse, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau), said the staffers involved in the redistricting would not comment on the advice of attorneys involved.\n\nBut Wellhouse added this observation: \"How can it be her present district? \u00a0She doesn't have a district.\"\n\nIndeed, Nusbaum doesn\u2019t hold a Senate seat, as the AFL-CIO claim suggests, or any office. She left the county executive\u2019s job in 2003.\n\nBy law, districts must be drawn to ensure that they have roughly equal-sized populations and, based on past cases, ensure that minority groups aren\u2019t discriminated against.\n\nAlso, the complaints about the redistricting are -- at least in Nusbaum\u2019s part of the state -- \u00a0bipartisan. Freshman Assembly Rep. Andr\u00e9 Jacque (R-Bellevue), asked GOP leaders to reconsider the map because his home was drawn into a new district, held by another freshman, Rep. John Klenke (R-Green Bay).\n\n\"The party in power has a lot of leeway,\" said Rick Esenberg, a conservative blogger, attorney and Marquette University law school professor. Esenberg \u00a0testified before a state Senate committee July 13, 2011, that he thought the maps would survive a legal challenge.\n\n\"There just is no effectively enforceable legal obligation to avoid pairings or even to do it in a way that equally impacts Democrats and Republicans,\" Esenberg said in an email, referring to the incumbents who are forced to run against each other.\n\nA 2007 report on the process to the Wisconsin Supreme Court touched on similar points.\n\n\"Redistricting is an inherently political process, one which defines the nature of\nrepresentative government. All of the stakeholders \u2013 political parties, incumbent\nlegislators, civil rights coalitions, interest groups, watchdog organizations, labor unions, even individual voters \u2013 seek to draw districts in a way that helps their allies and puts their opponents at a disadvantage,\" it said, in part.\n\nThe report noted that drawing lines to favor ones own party is a process that\u2019s more than 100 years old in Wisconsin.\n\nAfter the 1890 census, \"the Democrats were in power and made the existing apportionment so as to get out of it as many Democratic districts as possible. Previous Republican legislatures had set the example. \"\n\nSo where does that leave us now?\n\nIn criticizing the GOP maps, the state AFL-CIO says Nusbaum\u2019s home would be carved out of \"her state Senate district by half a block.\" She does live there and the map would fall the way the union claims. The maps may well face a legal challenge or even ultimately be redrawn by the courts. But that\u2019s all in the future and not part of the claim at hand"}

We\u2019re not serious about it.\"\nBy phone, Painter told us the United States is one of the few nations in the world not using the military to secure the border.

Separately, Israel\u2019s 7,500-member Border Police, a branch of the Israel National Police, deals with problems relating to public security, terror, severe crime, rioting, guarding sensitive sites and securing rural areas, according to Israel\u2019s Ministry of Public Security.\nIn Mexico, a mix of agencies rely on the Army and Navy and the federal police to watch over its borders, Christopher Wilson of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars told us by phone. But, Wilson said, Mexico\u2019s ports of entry are run by the country\u2019s customs service with immigration-related security managed by its Instituto de Migracion. The military branches provide security at the ports as needed, Wilson said, and also are in charge of stopping and catching traffickers in drugs and people.\nWilson said numerous countries similarly rely on military forces to pitch in near international borders in part because some border zones are isolated and other agencies don\u2019t have the manpower. He offered as examples of strong military presences Guatemala and Brazil.\nThen again, Ross Burkhart, a Boise State University professor, told us by email, countries don\u2019t deploy troops on borders unless they\u2019re engaged in cross-border conflicts \"that necessitate emergency border management procedures. Weak states in sub-Saharan Africa have most recently fallen into this category,\" Burkhart said.\nLance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University in Lawton, Okla., said by phone that Canada and Costa Rica, which has border guards but no regular military, are examples of the many countries that do not secure their respective borders with the military. Then again, many countries have border-area checkpoints run by officers with weapons, he said. Commenting on the sheriff\u2019s mention of TV news reports, Janda said: \"Anything on the news is going to be violence, right? They\u2019re not going to say nothing happened today on the border between Vietnam and Laos.\"\nU.S. Homeland Security\nFor our part, we checked on how the United States regulates border security, then peeked at how Canada does so. In both instances, the military has not been the primary agency handling border safety.\nBy email, Wilson said civilian law enforcement agencies handle U.S. border security. Still, he said, \"we have securitized border management, rolling customs and immigration functions into agencies that have law enforcement and national security at the heart of their mission.\"\nOn its website, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security says it \"secures the nation's air, land, and sea borders to prevent illegal activity while facilitating lawful travel and trade.\"\n\n"}

Those are the same years Cain cited.\n\nFirst, we\u2019ll deal with Cain\u2019s statement that projections show Medicare will go bankrupt by 2017.\n\nFactCheck.org wrote in 2009 about a nearly identical claim made in a TV ad for Americans for Prosperity, where Mark Block, the Cain campaign\u2019s chief operating officer, used to work. It checked another in April by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis.\n\nAs FactCheck.org concluded, Medicare does have big financial problems, but there\u2019s no reason to think it\u2019s going out of business.\n\nThere are four parts to Medicare, and they\u2019re funded by two separate trust funds run by the federal government.\n\nPart A covers inpatient hospital care, home health care, and services at skilled nursing facilities and hospices. It\u2019s paid for by the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which collects most of its money from federal payroll taxes.\n\nPart B covers doctor visits and other outpatient costs, while Part D covers prescription drugs. The Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund pays their bills, which are mostly covered by the federal government\u2019s general fund and premiums.\n\nMedicare Advantage, or Part C, gives recipients the option to receive care through private insurers. It doesn\u2019t have a trust fund. \u00a0\n\nFactCheck.org\u2019s articles said that the SMI fund is in good shape, and we found it still is. It\u2019s \"projected to remain in financial balance for all future years,\" according to a 2011 report by the fund\u2019s trustees\n\nBut the the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund? Not so much. As of this year, it\u2019s expected to be exhausted by 2024, according to midrange assumptions. If conditions worsen, the trust fund will run out by 2016.\n\nThis is better than the 2009 projections, where trustees expected funds to dry up by 2017, according to midrange assumptions. That\u2019s the same date that Cain used.\n\nStill, as bad as the news is about the hospital insurance fund, FactCheck.org decided it didn\u2019t truly signal bankruptcy. The fund is only a portion of Medicare. The remainder is solvent for the foreseeable future. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Congress has always pulled the hospital insurance fund from the brink of insolvency. According to a Congressional Research Service report, in 1970, the insolvency date was 1972. For the next 16 years, trustees expected its funds to be exhausted by the 1990s. Congress repeatedly changed legislation to lower fund spending and keep it from going dry.\n\nNow, let\u2019s deal with Cain\u2019s claim that Social Security will \"bottom out\" by 2037. \u00a0\n\nThere are two Social Security trust funds: Old-Age and Survivors Insurance, which pays for benefits to retired workers, their families and to families of deceased workers; and Disability Insurance, which pays for benefits to disabled workers and their families.\n\nIn 2009, midrange projections by the Social Security Board of Trustees said these trust funds combined will be exhausted in 2037, while the Disability Insurance fund will be gone by 2020. \u00a0The outlook worsened this year. The Disability Insurance fund will be exhausted in 2018. Combined, their assets will be exhausted by 2036.\n\nWhen those funds run dry, Social Security will struggle to pay out benefits as promised, according to trustees. \u00a0\n\nCain\u2019s information was based on a 2009 op-ed. He got that year\u2019s data correct, and projections have not changed dramatically since then.\n\nBut while it\u2019s fair for him to say that Social Security will \"bottom out\" by 2037, saying Medicare will go bankrupt by 2017 is a bit extreme. Only one of Medicare\u2019s funds is expected to be exhausted by that date, and Congress has never let it run dry. Lawmakers have bailed out the fund without fail for 40 years"}

In an exchange about security in Iraq, Pence said, \"Iraq has been overrun by ISIS because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate, Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement.\"\n\"No, that is incorrect,\" Kaine shot back.\nThe argument centers on a period in 2011, when the Obama administration was negotiating with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to keep troops in Iraq. Called a status of forces agreement, it would have kept up to 10,000 troops on the ground beyond Dec. 31, 2011. Obama was working against a deadline signed by President George W. Bush late in 2008. Under the Bush agreement, American troops would be gone by the end of 2011.\nAs 2011 began, military commanders in Washington and in Baghdad pushed for a residual force of between 16,000 and 24,000 to conduct counterrorism work and train Iraqi security forces.\nThe White House, reports show, was not open to a force that size. Its number was 10,000. But the Iraqis balked as well, so that number shrank.\nThe New York Times detailed how the force grew smaller until negotiations failed altogether.\nAccording to the New York Times, Obama himself ruled out the 10,000-troop option in an Aug. 13, 2011, conference call, dropping the number to about 3,500 troops.\nBut even that lower figure hit a brick wall. The agreement failed over a demand that American troops be given immunity from prosecution by Iraqis, a very touchy political issue within the Iraqi Parliament. Some experts said Iraqi leaders may not have been willing to take great political risk with their citizens in exchange for a relatively small American force.\nBut no immunity meant no sizable residual troop presence.\n\"When the Americans asked for immunity, the Iraqi side answered that it was not possible,\" al-Maliki said in an October 2011 news conference. \"The discussions over the number of trainers and the place of training stopped. Now that the issue of immunity was decided, and that no immunity to be given, the withdrawal has started.\"\n\n"}

While discussing Cuba and President Obama's effort to reestablish ties with the country, Cyr mentioned the relationship between Cuba and the Soviet Union.\nCuban leader \"Fidel Castro highlighted alliance with the Soviet Union by joining Nikita Khrushchev in a raucous 1960 visit to the United Nations. The New York session was punctuated by the Soviet leader publicly pounding a shoe on a desk (while wearing two shoes),\" Cyr wrote.\nThe shoe Khrushchev famously pounded on the table at the U.N. was a spare?\nThat struck us as a surprising historical footnote -- so surprising we wondered why we hadn't heard about this third shoe before. Why bring a special shoe to a debate when you're wearing two that would easily serve as makeshift gavels?\nIntrigued, we sought details.\nWe thought we might find some information at Wikipedia. Sure enough, there's a whole page devoted to the \"shoe-banging incident.\"\nBut it makes no mention of a third shoe. More surprisingly, it turns out that there's good reason to question whether Khrushchev ever banged his shoe at all.\nFirst, we emailed Cyr, asking for the source for his twist on the story.\nHe said it came from \"The Soviet Union 1917-1991\" by Martin McCauley, a senior lecturer at the University of London. Cyr quoted page 273 of the book: \"It was all premeditated. Careful examination of the shoe-bashing incident reveals he was wearing two shoes at the time.\"\nWe wrote back to Cyr, asking if McCauley cited any source that might indicate what type of \"careful examination\" was done, especially when there are questions about whether the shoe bashing occurred at all.\nCyr never responded. So we bought the book.\nMcCauley, who has 41 footnotes for that chapter alone, lists no source for the factoid. Nor does he offer any specifics about the \"careful examination.\"\nSo we emailed him. \"My source for the Khrushchev shoe banging episode was a Russian,\" he responded. \"Unfortunately it is too long ago to remember who gave me the information.\"\nThus, there's no hard evidence a third shoe was used in an attempt to clog the debate, as it were.\nAnd we noticed something else. In his book, McCauley reports that Khrushchev \"shouted, laughed and interrupted speakers and even banged his shoe on his desk during Harold Macmillan's speech.\" Macmillan was the British prime minister at the time.\nThat's interesting because, according to U.N. records, Macmillan didn't address the General Assembly on the day of the alleged footwear incident, and the New York Times, which reported the story on the front page of its Oct. 13 edition, gave a very different account.\nOn Oct. 12, the Times says, \"Mr. Khrushchev was apparently infuriated by a statement by Lorenzo Sumulong, a member of the Philippine delegation. . . . Mr. Khrushchev thereupon pulled off his right shoe, stood up and brandished the shoe at the Philippine delegate on the other side of the hall. He then banged the shoe on his desk.\"\n\n"}

In fact, oil production on federal lands has decreased 14 percent over the past year.\"\n\nOil production is down 14 percent on federal lands? We thought this claim was well worth a check.\n\nOur colleagues at PolitiFact National and PolitiFact Ohio have looked at similar claims. Both teams cautioned against blaming a president for current oil production levels. Factors such as natural and man-made disasters, changes in technology and presidential policies dating back decades are also at play. \u00a0\n\n\"I don't think Obama can claim a lot of credit for production levels now, and I'm not even sure that [George W. Bush] can,\" Jay Hakes, who directed the independent U.S. Energy Information Administration for seven years during the Clinton administration, told PolitiFact National.\n\nHakes is author of \"A Declaration of Energy Independence,\" which looks at energy policy from President Harry S. Truman to President George W. Bush.\n\n\"If you're going to go back \u2014 who should get the credit \u2014 I might be able to find something that Nixon did,\" Hakes said.\n\nPolitiFact Ohio addressed these factors when they looked into a March 26 statement by that state\u2019s U.S. Sen. Rob Portman: \"Last year, we produced 14 percent less oil on public lands than we did the year before.\"\n\nThey found it was Mostly True. They checked the number against data from the U.S. Department of the Interior\u2019s Office of Natural Resources Revenue, which tracks royalties to the government for oil, gas and coal produced on federal lands and waters. They also cross-checked it against information from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which provides the federal government\u2019s official energy statistics.\n\nAlthough the number was accurate, Portman\u2019s statement needed additional clarification or information. At least part of the drop on public lands and waters last fiscal year was due to the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster and an apparent shift by oil companies to private lands for \"fracking.\" (Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is a method of extracting oil or gas that opens up rock with a pressurized mix of water and chemicals.)\n\nAbout one week after PolitiFact Ohio\u2019s story ran, Crossroads GPS, a conservative group, released a Web ad that tied Obama even more directly than Portman did to a decline in oil production.\n\nThe group said that oil \"production's down where Obama's in charge,\" and cited the 14 percent figure. \u00a0\n\nPolitiFact National gave Crossroads GPS a Half True.\n\nThe 14 percent decline took place in a single year -- fiscal year 2011, or Oct. 1, 2010, through Sept. 30, 2011. This time period includes the aftermath of the deadly Deepwater Horizon oil spill of April 20, 2010.\n\nThe Department of the Interior issued a directive about a month after the disaster that said they would not consider drilling permits for deepwater wells for six months. Changes in federal regulations followed.\n\nNational also found the data Crossroads GPS used did not tell the whole story.\n\nFrom fiscal year 2009 through 2011, crude oil sales from federal lands and waters did suffer a net decline of less than 1 percent, according to the Energy Information Administration. In 2009, oil production totaled 632 million barrels. In 2011, it was down to 626 million.\n\nHowever, during the first two fiscal years, oil production rose. In 2010, those sales totaled 726 million, a year-over-year increase of 14.9 percent.\n\nFurthermore, 2011\u2019s 14 percent drop in production on federal lands and waters took place as onshore production rose slightly. Crude oil sales stood at 108 million barrels in 2010. They rose to 112 million barrels, an increase of 3.7 percent. \u00a0\n\nWe found that Kingston\u2019s op-ed piece, which places the blame for gas prices squarely on Obama\u2019s shoulders, shares these accuracy problems. He cited the 14 percent figure, saying Obama is \"only making things worse\" for families struggling with high gas prices.\n\nHis spokesman Chris Crawford argued the congressman\u2019s claim deserves a True. The number is accurate, and Obama is saying energy production is up on his watch.\n\n\"I don't see how you can come to any conclusion but it being the truth,\" Crawford said in an email.\n\nBut we\u2019re not rating Obama\u2019s statements. We\u2019re also not taking issue with Kingston\u2019s oil production data.\n\nOur issue is context, and that\u2019s where Kingston runs into trouble. He cherry-picked the most unflattering oil production numbers under the Obama administration and ignored the impact of events well outside the president\u2019s control: changes in technology, decades of presidential policy, and most importantly, the Deepwater Horizon spill.\n\nKingston\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context"}

They have not received them since shortly after the start of the Great Recession.\n\nA 2011 analysis by USA Today shows that Georgia public employees make less than those in other states, but it\u2019s not clear whether the study adjusts for the state\u2019s cost of living.\n\nAbrams pointed us to data from the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, a think tank that focuses on state issues, for more information on per-capita spending.\n\nGenerally speaking, state per-capita spending is the amount of money the state spends in a fiscal year on things such as salaries and services, divided by the state\u2019s population. Policymakers often use the figure to argue that a state is spending too much or too little. \u00a0\n\nGBPI sent us rankings its researchers made with data from the Tax Policy Center, \u00a0a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution think tanks. The Tax Policy Center\u2019s research is widely used by experts with different political leanings. \u00a0\n\nThe Tax Policy Center\u2019s data is based on numbers from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s annual survey of state and local finances, which is a common source of information for state policy experts.\n\nGBPI used 2009 data, the latest numbers available, to compare Georgia with other states and the District of Columbia.\n\nGeorgia spent $6,543.81 per capita, ranking 49th out of 51, or third from the bottom.\n\nThe two highest were Alaska and the District of Columbia. Alaska spent $17,802, \u00a0while D.C. spent $16,906. \u00a0Pennsylvania is at the median, spending $7,780 \u00a0a year.\n\nAbrams was close, but not quite on target.\n\nNow, there\u2019s more than one way to rank state spending per capita.\n\nThe GBPI ranked Georgia by a measure that combines spending by state and local governments.\n\nResearchers often prefer this measure because statewide governments split the cost of services with their local counterparts in different ways, said Kim Rueben, a senior fellow with the Tax Policy Center.\n\nFor instance, one state may prefer to shoulder most of the costs of education on the state level, while others may prefer to fund education at the local level.\n\nThe census also collects spending by states only, so we took a look at its 2009 data.\n\nGeorgia was tied for last place in total state spending. It tied with Florida for second-to-last place in \"direct expenditures,\" a slightly different measure that excludes intergovernmental spending.\n\nNone of these data show South Dakota trailing Georgia in per-capita spending.\n\nRegardless, these data all support Abrams\u2019 broader point.

That estimate also includes teachers, construction workers and seasonal workers who are left out of the Census Bureau estimate if they are not working year-round or full time.

This comes from Table 9 of the BLS data and it includes part-time jobs, which are often filled by women.\n\nGoing back to weekly wages, on Table 5 of that report, if you look at part-time work (less than 35 hours), women earned 5 cents more for every dollar earned by men.

But as soon as the number of hours rose to 40 hours, women's earnings dropped to about 87 cents per dollar.\n\nThe underlying concern here is that women are being paid less than men for doing the same job.

{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Says Republican Reid Ribble says stimulus bill failed to jumpstart the economy, but his \"roofing company made almost $300,000 off stimulus funded projects.\"", "evidence": "If you can\u2019t trust a candidate\u2019s own official campaign biography, just what can you trust?\n\nThat\u2019s a question that popped up as we tried to determine the accuracy of a television ad from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee attacking Reid Ribble, the Republican challenging two-term U.S. Rep. Steve Kagen (D-Appleton).\n\nNo, Ribble is not one of those wannabes who claimed he was a decorated war hero when the closest he came to action was watching a Rambo movie. This is more mundane -- until recently, Ribble\u2019s bio posted on his own campaign website said he owned a roofing company.\n\nThat ownership claim helped give the DCCC -- whose aim is to win or hold seats for Democrats -- an opening to air an attack ad portraying Ribble as a hypocrite on stimulus money.\n\nThe 8th Congressional District, which includes Green Bay and the Fox Valley, has long been considered a swing seat. Both sides have targeted it this year. And with jobs on the mind of voters, it\u2019s little surprise Democrats would tag Ribble as looking out for himself instead of others.\n\nThe ad starts with newsreel-style black and white footage, with an announcer loudly proclaiming, \"Extra! Extra! Read all about it! Politician says one thing, does another!\" It goes on to say Ribble has criticized the stimulus plan, which Kagen supported, saying it failed to \"jumpstart\" the economy, but his \"roofing company made almost $300,000 off stimulus funded projects.\"\n\nThat was just the first of the finger pointing: The Ribble campaign responded by calling the Democrats liars, saying the candidate sold the family business in December 2009 and, besides, the jobs in question weren\u2019t worth anywhere near $300,000.\n\nCharges of lies and hypocrisy. That\u2019s our cue.\n\nLet\u2019s try to sort this all out.\n\nIt should be an easy job -- either Ribble\u2019s roofing company got the contracts or it didn\u2019t; either he owned it at the time or it had been sold. But, as reporters and roofers know, looks can be deceiving. Sometimes you just have to look under a couple of shingles to see what\u2019s what.\n\nFor its backup, spokeswoman Gabby Adler said the DCCC found references to Reid Ribble owning the company on his campaign website and the roofing company\u2019s website. Though not mentioned in the ad, the Democrats are citing a contract awarded by the Kaukauna School District to Security Roofing -- a division of The Ribble Group -- to renovate the roof of Haen Elementary School. The contract was awarded in October 2009, but the work was done in 2010.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the ownership question.\n\nBrandon Moody, Ribble campaign manager, said The Ribble Group was sold to Ribble\u2019s nephew, Troy Ribble, in December 2009. Ribble, Moody said, had no ownership stake when the project was done and the company was paid.\n\n\"It\u2019s a timeline issue and it\u2019s a lie,\" Moody said.\n\nThen we peeked under the shingle.\n\nWe found it\u2019s the Ribble campaign that has a timeline problem.\n\nThe roofing job was awarded by the school district in October 2009, said Robert Schafer, district financial officer for the Kaukauna schools. That\u2019s before the company was sold. Not only that, Schafer said, when the bids were sought, Reid Ribble was the contact person for the company. Troy Ribble, confirmed his uncle handled the bid for the project.\n\nIn our search, we came across paperwork filed with the Virginia State Corporation Commission in February 2010 that lists Reid Ribble as chairman of the company. They had done some work in Virginia earlier this year.\n\nWhat gives?\n\n\"He is the chairman of the board of directors,\" Troy Ribble told PolitiFact Wisconsin.\n\nTroy said his uncle, however, does not own stock in the 52-year-old company and is not involved as an executive in day-to-day operations. Reid Ribble remains a consultant, Troy said. The acquisition makes him the third generation of Ribbles to own the firm.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, on Oct. 13, 2010 -- some 10 months after Ribble said he sold the company -- we found his campaign website read: \"Reid owns and operates one of the most successful roof construction and consulting companies in the United States.\" Ribble\u2019s Facebook page is even clearer: It lists him as the president of the Ribble Group Inc.\n\nEven the company site still listed him as president until at least early October. Like the campaign site, that website has since been changed.\n\nFor his part, Moody referred to the out-of-date campaign website as \"minutia.\"\n\nBut for a first-time candidate, one promising to bring his business acumen to Washington, that life story -- and how it\u2019s presented to the public -- strikes us as important.\n\nMeanwhile, we asked repeatedly for documentation that the firm had been sold, but the campaign did not provide it. The campaign sent us a copy of a June 14, 2010, letter from attorney Roy Fine to Troy Ribble that refers to the sale of the company.\n\nThe letter asks Troy to sign \"Resolutions by you as the sole remaining shareholder dated effective Dec. 10,\" as well as forms for the redemption of Reid Ribble\u2019s stock and his employment agreement.\n\nSo, regardless of whether the company was sold, Reid Ribble still has strong ties to the company. He is chairman, receives a monthly consulting fee and was active when the company bid on the school district work.\n\nNow let\u2019s look into the $300,000 figure the Democrats use as the price tag.\n\nTo back up the claim, Adler produced a letter from the school district to the state Department of Public Instruction outlining $1 million worth of projects that it hoped to finance with the no-interest bonds issued as a result of the stimulus. The list included $700,000 worth of roofing projects.\n\nBut asking is different than receiving. \u00a0\n\nOnly $500,000 worth of bonding authority was granted, said Natalie Rew, auditor for the state Department of Public Instruction. Of that, only about $133,000 was paid to The Ribble Group, Schafer said, noting the remainder went to other projects. (The Ribble Group has done other large projects for the district, work not funded with stimulus dollars.)\n\nThat\u2019s a long way from making \"almost $300,000 off stimulus funded projects.\"\n\nThat\u2019s laying the shingles on a little thick.\n\nSo, what do we know?\n\nRibble says he sold his company in December 2009, but has not shown us a definitive document to prove it, instead offering a \"trust me\" response. That\u2019s hard to do when the campaign\u2019s own website, which the Democrats relied on in making their claim, until recently, touted Ribble\u2019s ownership. Besides, Ribble remains involved as chairman.\n\nAs for the project itself, the school district said the job was awarded while Reid Ribble was in charge, even if the work was done later. But the $300,000 figure the Democrats cite is also off, way off -- the actual amount received was about $133,000"}
{"label": "pants-fire", "claim": "Chain email Members of Congress can \"retire with the same pay after only one term\" in office", "evidence": "Political trends come and go, but the classics endure.\n\nSuch is the case with a chain email PolitiFact Ohio received to start the new year. When we received a nearly identical version a couple of years ago, we said it could be \"a new classic of the genre.\"\n\nThe email claims that Congress gets special perks nobody else does; complains that a complacent media ignores the news, and requests that recipients of the email forward it on to 20 more people.\n\nWe examined one of the special perks mentioned in the email, that \"the staffers of Congress family members are exempt from having to pay back student loans.\" The claim is confusingly worded, but we assumed that it referred to relatives of members of Congress and Congressional staffers.\n\nWe gave the statement a rating of Pants on Fire because it was (and is) ridiculously false. Relatives of members of Congress and Congressional staffers have to pay back their loans like everyone else.\n\nBut the still-circulating email contains another claim that several readers have asked about in recent days: that members of Congress can \"retire with the same pay after only one term.\"\n\nThis claim is a classic in its own right. Our friends at the urban legend checker Snopes.com say it has been circulating in various chain emails since at least 2000.\n\nThe claim means that rank-and-file members of the House of Representatives would receive full pay of $174,000 per year, for the rest of their lives, after serving as little as two years.\n\nNice work if you can get it. But members of Congress can't.\n\nA report on \"Retirement Benefits for Members of Congress,\" prepared in November by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, outlines how pension benefits are calculated.\n\nThe key provision: no member of Congress is eligible for any pension unless he or she has served in Congress for at least five years. (Senators serve six-year terms; House members must seek reelection every two years.)\n\nTo collect, a congressman or senator must be age 62, or be at least age 50 with 20 years of service, or be any age with 25 years of service.\n\nUnder the most recent pension program, adopted in 1984, the size of a pension is based on the highest three years of a member's salary, the number of years of service and a multiplier, which is 1.7 percent for the first 20 years of service and 1.0 percent for subsequent years.\n\nHere\u2019s an example, using a typical 25-year rank-and-file member who retired this year. The pension would be the sum of two calculations. First, multiply $172,443 [the average salary over the last three years] times 20 years times 0.017. Then, multiply $172,443 times 5 years times 0.01 and add that number to the first calculation. The total: about $67,250 per year.\n\nA three-term congressman (or one-term senator) who has now reached retirement age would be eligible for an annual pension of $17,588 for six years of work. That's generous, but not close to full pay.\n\nFederal law prevents members of Congress from getting full-pay retirement when they leave office. The report says, \"By law, the starting amount of a member's retirement annuity may not exceed 80 percent of his or her final salary.\"\n\nUnder the formula, it would take 67 years of service to hit that limit.\n\nSo the email saying that members of Congress can \"receive full pay retirement after serving one term\" is blatantly bogus. It's never full pay and the only one-term members who would be eligible for any pension would be senators.\n\nSnopes.com rated the pension claim as False. Our colleagues at FactCheck.org have also debunked the claim -- which, over the years, has been accompanied by assertions that members of Congress don't pay into their Social Security (they have since 1984) or that they don't contribute anything toward their retirement (they do).\n\nFor a bogus claim that\u2019s been circulating at least 13 years, and for anyone who still spreads it, we\u2019ll break out the matches. Pants on Fire!\n\n"}

{"label": "true", "claim": "Gen. Peter Chiarelli About 106,000 soldiers had \"a prescription of three weeks or more\" for pain, depression or anxiety medication.", "evidence": "Leaders of the U.S. Army need to take more active steps to prevent a growing number of soldiers from committing suicide, according to a major study released by the Army. Gen. Peter Chiarelli discussed the study on This Week with Christiane Amanpour.\n\nThe study documented complex pressures -- including overly long deployments, more tolerance for high-risk behavior among soldiers and lax standards for leaders keeping tabs on their soldiers.\n\nAnother complicating factor: increased use of prescription antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs and pain medications.\n\n\"We know that we had over 106,000 soldiers last year who had a prescription of three weeks or more for some kind of antidepressant, anti-anxiety medicine,\" said Chiarelli.\n\nA few moments later, he added, \"A portion of those 106,000 soldiers that I told you are on some kind of pain medication, it has nothing to do with a behavior health issue. There are soldiers who have been on two, three, four deployments, hucking a rucksack filled with equipment that may weigh 70 to 80 pounds at 8,000 feet, and they've got a knee injury or a leg injury that is painful. Probably should stay home and get operated on, but they go back for the second deployment, and they're on some kind of a pain medication. We have soldiers who suck it up all the time and hide from their leaders when they're hurt.\"\n\nChiarelli was referring to information in the Army's Health Promotion, Risk Reduction, and Suicide Prevention Report, released Aug. 5, 2010. This seemed like an important issue to explore further.\n\nThe report explains that historically, the Army's suicide rate has been much lower than the civilian population's. But the Army's rate began increasing in 2004 and surpassed the national average in 2008. That year, the suicide rate in the Army was 20.2 per 100,000, compared with a typical civilian rate of 19.2. This increase prompted the study.\n\n\"In Fiscal Year (FY) 2009, 160 active duty Soldiers took their lives, making suicide the third leading cause of death among the Army population,\" the study states. \"If we include accidental death, which frequently is the result of high risk behavior (drinking and driving, drug overdose, etc.), we find that less young men and women die in combat than die by their own actions. Simply stated, we are often more dangerous to ourselves than the enemy.\"\n\nThe report affirms the 106,000 number that Chiarelli uses. \"Latest accounts estimate that approximately 106,000 Soldiers are prescribed some form of pain, depression or anxiety medications. The potential for abuse is obvious,\" it states.\n\nThe report also discusses whether these and other prescription drugs are being abused by members of the military:\n\n\"There is concern that potential prescription drug abuse is masked in our current system. This is the result of the increase in prescriptions which expands the population authorized to use pharmaceuticals. For example, the growing population who has obtained prescriptions for amphetamines has resulted in an increased rate of authorized use. Unfortunately, there is no definitive method to ascertain if the use was authorized or illicit. As a result, we have masked a subset of that population who are either dependent or illicitly use drugs. Ultimately, if left unchecked, this gap facilitates a population of drug addicts and distributors.\"\n\nThe report also notes that many soldiers are aged 18 to 29, and there are continuing questions about the use of antidepressants -- specifically, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) -- among young people, and whether these medications sometimes increase the risk of suicide. \"The Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) is cognizant of this issue and is investigating the use of these and other medications to better manage care,\" the report states.\n\nThe report makes additional observations about prescription drug users in the military. Pain medications seem to be more common than antidepressants or anti-anxiety drugs; \"14% of the force is taking some form of opiate medication,\" according to the report.\u00a0 The percentage for antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications appear somewhat lower, with between 3 and 6 percent of the deployed force receiving such medication, according to evidence the report cites. Anecdotal evidence in the report indicates some soldiers receive multiple prescriptions for pain and depression.\n\nWe should emphasize the study draws no hard conclusions about the role that prescription drugs play in military suicides. \"The impact of increased use of antidepressant, psychiatric and narcotic pain management medications has not been comprehensively studied in a military population,\" the report states.\n\nIn the interview with Amanpour, Chiarelli rejected the idea that soldiers were overly medicated. \"We know that the drugs that we're talking about are cleared by the CENTCOM surgeon for soldiers to be taking when they're downrange. So we're not sending any soldier into harm's way who is taking a drug that we feel would somehow endanger him or others,\" he said.\n\nFinally, we should note that the report links policing potential drug addiction to military leadership in a section titled \"The Lost Art of Leadership in Garrison.\" The Army has been transformed in recent years, the report states, so that combat readiness has been emphasized more than \"good order and discipline practices.\" Unannounced health and welfare checks and inspections \"have been lost\" as part of that transition. \"There are instances where a leader\u2019s lack of Soldier accountability resulted in suicide victims not being found until they had been dead for three or four weeks,\" the report noted.\n\nWhile the report raises a host of issues, we're only ruling on what the general said about the rate of medication among soldiers. The Army report and other testimony that we found support Chiarelli's statement that approximately 106,000 soldiers had \"a prescription of three weeks or more\" for pain, depression or anxiety medication"}

This is about political obstruction.\"\n\nIs Obama really correct that his judicial nominees \"have waited three times longer\" than those nominated by President George W. Bush?\n\nThe answer hinges on how you define the phrase \"to receive confirmation votes.\"\n\nFirst, a civics reminder. The president is responsible for nominating judges, and the Senate is responsible for confirming them. Once a nomination is made, it goes to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Once it clears the committee, it goes to the Senate floor. By the book, the final confirmation vote only requires a majority, but in recent years, senators have increasingly threatened to filibuster -- that is, block -- judicial picks. This forces the Senate to first vote on ending the filibuster threat, a vote that requires 60 votes, not 51.\n\nThe fact that there\u2019s a two-step process -- first moving from nomination to committee, and then from committee to a confirmation vote -- has led to contradictory trends on nominee delays. Bush\u2019s nominees tended to get delayed before winning committee approval, while Obama\u2019s have more often been delayed on the floor.\n\nThe Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, published a thorough analysis of judicial nomination delays on May 2, 2013. Here are some of the highlights.\n\nFrom nomination to confirmation\n\nMeasured one way -- from nomination to confirmation -- Obama\u2019s claim is off base.\n\nAccording to CRS, the average number of days from nomination to confirmation for first-term circuit court nominees -- which include the D.C. Circuit -- was 240.2 for Obama. That was shorter than the 277 days faced by the nominees of George W. Bush. (Obama\u2019s waits were, however, longer than for presidents George H.W. Bush, Reagan and Clinton.)\n\nUsing the median wait, rather than the average wait, Obama\u2019s nominees did face slightly longer delays than Bush\u2019s did -- 225.5 days for Obama compared to 216 days for Bush. But even that was nowhere near the three-times-longer figure Obama cited.\n\n"}

Why are Muslim armies so useless against ISIS? ISIS isn't 10 feet tall. There are 20,000 or 30,000 of them. The countries surrounding ISIS have armies totaling 5 million people. So why do we have to be the ones leading the fight? Or be in the fight at all?\"\nWe were wondering if Maher's numbers were correct and Islamic State fighters are potentially outgunned by as much as 250 to 1 in the region.\nISIS size\nIn the past, we've found reliable estimates of the strength of ISIS, also known as ISIL, are hard to come by. United States intelligence data from May to August of 2014 put the number at 20,000 to 31,500 fighters. Media reports at the time, based on unnamed sources, put the number at anywhere from 40,000 to 100,000.\nMaher\u2019s spokesman, Adam Schiff, said the comedian was going by that widely available U.S. estimate.\nThe latest U.S. estimate is 19,000 to 25,000 released by the White House on Feb. 4. The Obama administration contends that the fight against ISIS has brought the number down. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the numbers show ISIS is finding it increasingly harder to find replacements for the thousands of fighters who have been killed.\nSo Maher is still in the ballpark.\nSurrounding militaries\nBut what about the militaries surrounding ISIS?\nWe turned to the World Bank's website and its tally of armed forces personnel in various countries. The most recent counts listed are for the year 2013. The website says its source is \"The Military Balance,\" published by the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.\nIf you consider the countries bordering Iraq and Syria \u2014\u00a0Iran (with 563,000 armed forces personnel), Jordan (115,500), Kuwait (22,600), Lebanon (80,000), Saudi Arabia (251,500) and Turkey (612,800) \u2014\u00a0you get a total of 1.6 million.\nAdd in Iraq (177,600) and Syria (178,000) themselves and that brings the total to 2 million. That's less than half of Maher\u2019s figure.\nWhen we heard back from Maher's spokesman, he said the comedian was also including the armies of Bahrain, Egypt, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\nHe's obviously using a broader definition of \"surrounding\" countries. Oman is about 560 miles from its closest border with Iraq.\n\n"}

Rep. Alissa Keny-Guyer, the House\u2019s newest member, was one of the carriers of the legislation. She gave a moving floor speech, invoking the memory of her father who passed away from complications due to AIDS in the 1980s.\n\n\"Much has changed in the past 24 years,\" she said. \"Treatment has reduced transmission.\"\n\nIndeed, she noted, a study last year found that those who were being treated for HIV were 96 percent less likely to pass the infection on to their partners.\n\n\"The problem is that too many people still go undiagnosed,\" Keny-Guyer said. Testing rates remain stagnant. But, she said, these new guidelines could boost the numbers of those getting tested in Oregon.\n\n\"Nationally, 21 percent (of those with HIV) are undiagnosed,\" she told colleagues. \"And in Oregon, only 41 percent of adults have ever been tested.\"\n\nWe thought the second figure was a little surprising, especially given that the Centers for Disease Control recommends routine screening for all patients between the ages of 13 and 64 and annual screening (at least) for \"high risk\" individuals. According to the CDC website, high risk patients include \"injection-drug users and their sex partners, persons who exchange sex for money or drugs, sex partners of HIV-infected persons, and MSM (men who have sex with men) or heterosexual persons who themselves or whose sex partners have had more than one sex partner since their most recent HIV test.\" Pregnant women are also encouraged to get screened as part of their routine prenatal tests.\n\nThe CDC doesn\u2019t keep track of testing rates, but its website does link to Kaiser State Health Facts, a huge database supported by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nAccording to that website, the testing figures for Oregon are slightly lower than what Keny-Guyer reported. Less than 37 percent of Oregonians between the ages of 18 and 64 have been tested for HIV. The national average is 40 percent.\n\nIf you\u2019re talking in the last year, the figures are even lower -- 18 percent in Oregon, 21.5 percent nationwide.\n\nThe numbers were off slightly from what Keny-Guyer reported on the House floor, so we talked to an aide in her office to see if there was another source we weren\u2019t considering. The aide told us that the representative used numbers from the previous year (2009 rather than 2010) and forwarded us the latest statistics -- the ones we\u2019d already found.\n\nWe wanted to do our due diligence, so we called up two additional organizations. Michael Kaplan, the executive director of Cascade AIDS project, said Kaiser\u2019s site was the best he could come up with. \"I couldn\u2019t give you a better statistic than they have there,\" he said.\n\nKarynn Fish, a spokeswoman for the Oregon Health Authority, told us the same thing. Anything the state had, she said, would be older and less accurate.\n\nWith that, we turn to our ruling. While speaking about a bill that seeks to raise the rate of HIV testing in Oregon, Keny-Guyer told colleagues that \"only 41 percent of adults have ever been tested.\" The most recent statewide number is actually a bit lower -- 37 percent. But Keny-Guyer used a correct statistic, it was just a year old. We don't consider that significant enough to downgrade our ruling"}

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Don Balfour An illegal immigrant who gains admission at a public college takes class space away from students who are legal residents.", "evidence": "This legislative session, many state lawmakers have Illegal immigrants on the brain.\n\nBills under consideration at the Gold Dome aim to chase illegal immigrants from the state\u2019s work force, prevent cities from offering them safe haven, and in the case of House Bill 59, block them from admission to Georgia\u2019s public colleges.\n\nThey\u2019re taking up classroom space that could go to students who are legal residents, argued state Sen. Don Balfour.\n\nDuring a Feb. 15 committee hearing, the Snellville Republican told the story of two freshmen he said had trouble registering for classes at Gainesville State College and Georgia Gwinnett College because they were full. Both were legal residents.\n\n\"If there\u2019s one student that\u2019s at Georgia Gwinnett College that\u2019s not here legally, that student [the legal resident] is losing his position to someone who\u2019s not here legally,\" Balfour said.\n\nReally? We thought the Board of Regents, which oversees the University System of Georgia, changed its policy in October to prevent this from happening.\n\nStarting this fall, no illegal immigrant will be allowed admission in any public school in the state that turns away qualified applicants, such as the University of Georgia and Georgia Tech. That means no legal resident will be denied admission because an illegal immigrant has already filled his slot.\n\nHouse Bill 59, which Balfour backs, would bar illegal immigrants from enrolling in any public, postsecondary education institution in Georgia.\n\nRight now, Georgia\u2019s public colleges may admit illegal immigrants, so long as the students pay full tuition instead of the much lower in-state resident rate.\n\nBut not for long. In March 2010, Kennesaw State University student Jessica Colotl, an illegal immigrant, was arrested on a traffic charge. School officials realized she was being charged in-state tuition. \u00a0\n\nHer arrest prompted the Board of Regents to ban illegal immigrants from the state\u2019s five most selective schools starting in fall 2011: the University of Georgia, Georgia Tech, Georgia State, Georgia College & State University, and Georgia Health Sciences University.\n\nGainesville State and Georgia Gwinnett grant admission to every student who meets basic admission requirements. Since every qualified person can enroll, none of them, legal or illegal, can be shut out. Getting into the classes students want to take, though, can be another story.\n\nPolitiFact Georgia talked to Balfour, who gave us more information about the freshmen who could not get into classes they wanted. He did not identify them.\n\nThe Gainesville State student registered early for classes and went off to Army basic training, Balfour said. While he was away, a notice came in the mail saying he needed to pay an additional charge to complete registration. By the time the soldier returned, he had been dropped from his courses and had to sign up again. Class times he wanted were full.\n\nIn the Georgia Gwinnett case, a student decided one month before the beginning of the term that he wanted to go to college and found most classes were already full, Balfour said. \u00a0\n\nBalfour said he was not aware of specific cases where an illegal immigrant took the spot of a legal resident, but said that Colotl likely did so.\n\nThat\u2019s a sensible assumption. One month before the Colotl\u2019s arrest, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that campuses were running low on courses and faculty. Kennesaw State students said they had to delay graduation because they could not get into all the courses they needed.\n\nYet we found no specific evidence in that article or elsewhere of illegal immigrants keeping legal residents out of classes. \u00a0\n\nRepresentatives from both schools mentioned by Balfour said that typically, a slot is open that term for the same course but at another time. Still, popular courses do fill up.\n\nAfter Colotl\u2019s arrest, regents determined the number of what they call \"undocumented\" students in the University System.\n\nOf the University System\u2019s more than 310,000 students, 501 were \"undocumented,\" their data showed. That\u2019s less than 0.2 percent. Fifty-two were Gainesville State students. Two attended Georgia Gwinnett. Some 8,800 students are enrolled at Gainesville State. Georgia Gwinnett\u2019s enrollment is about 5,300.\n\nIn 2010, leaders at several public colleges told the AJC that students can\u2019t get into classes they want because the schools don\u2019t have enough money to hold more classes. During the past 10 years, University System enrollment spiked by about 34 percent, according to state data, but the state Legislature increased funding by only about 12 percent.\n\nBalfour acknowledged to PolitiFact Georgia that in most cases, students are likely crowded out of classes because there isn\u2019t enough space. Still, lawmakers shouldn\u2019t overlook the potential problem posed by illegal immigrants, he said.\n\nStrictly speaking, Balfour\u2019s initial statement is correct. If a single illegal immigrant snags a spot in a popular course that fills up, legal residents can miss out.\n\nHowever, Balfour\u2019s statement does not acknowledge the fundamental problem, which is tight resources. Given the small number of \"undocumented\" students, it\u2019s safe to say that most of the time, legal residents are taking the slots away from one another. \u00a0\n\nBalfour\u2019s statement is accurate but could have used clarification"}

According to reports during his time in office, he prayed daily and would regularly consult with pastors for spiritual guidance.\nIn the attached 3-and-a-half minute video, Obama does not denigrate Christianity. He is shown arguing for political compromise across religions. \"We are no longer a Christian nation, or at least not just,\" he says, \"We are also a Jewish nation, a Muslim nation, and a Buddhist nation, and a Hindu nation, and a nation of non-believers.\"\nBecause of this, Obama argues, making political policy based solely on religious beliefs is unsustainable. He gives the example of a Christian who objects to abortion on religious grounds: Though they may feel strongly that is wrong because of their religion, he says, they cannot use the Bible as their evidence.\nObama also notes that, if the government was led by religion, many books of the Bible would not be applicable for making policy. As the audience laughs, he says that Leviticus, which condones slavery but forbids shellfish, or Deuteronomy, which allows for the stoning of wayward children, would not be suitable for modern laws.\n\n"}
{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Leonard Pitts, Jr. \"America\u2019s least-trusted news sources are also its most popular.\"", "evidence": "Many words have been said and many numbers crunched to explain political polarization in America. One theory is that liberals and conservatives swim in different waters when it comes to news and information. Liberal columnist Leonard Pitts, Jr. offered a new spin on this theme. In a Nov.1 op-ed, Pitt said most of the fault lies on the right end of the spectrum. He blamed conservative hardliners who \"are more rabid in support of those who validate their views than the rest of us are in pursuit of simple truth.\"\nTo prove his point, Pitts cited a recent report from the Pew Research Center that explored the level of trust enjoyed by 36 news sources, ranging from television networks to partisan blogs. Pitts focused his column on two sources, Rush Limbaugh and Fox News. In the Pew study, 39 percent of respondents said they distrusted Limbaugh, and 37 percent voiced the same misgivings about Fox News.\nPitts noted that Rush Limbaugh \"hosts the number one show on radio and Fox is the highest-rated cable news outlet.\" His conclusion?\n\"America\u2019s least-trusted news sources are also its most popular.\"\nA reader asked us to check that statement and we are happy to oblige.\nThere are two elements to check: Are Limbaugh and Fox News the least-trusted? And are they the most popular with Americans?\n\u2018Least-trusted\u2019\nYes, the Pew survey found that more people distrusted Limbaugh and Fox News than any other outlet.\nBut that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the two outlets are the \"least-trusted\" as Pitts claimed. To find that out, you need to account for the percentage of people who say that they trust Limbaugh and Fox News.\nFor instance, while 39 percent of respondents said they distrusted Limbaugh, 12 percent said they trust him. And for Fox News, more people (44 percent) said they trust the network then said they distrust it (37 percent).\nFactoring that in, Limbaugh has the biggest trust gap of any of the 36 outlets polled.

{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Fight for the Future \"We saw the true danger of the FCC's net neutrality repeal when Verizon was caught throttling California fire fighters.\"", "evidence": "The idea that greedy corporations would screw over the average Internet user was perhaps the most vocal concern raised last year when a bundle of Internet protections, known as net neutrality, went on the chopping block.\nNow, three months after the regulations officially died, proponents are staking out a very different position as they work to resurrect the rules.\nNet neutrality must be restored, they argue, because its repeal has jeopardized public safety.\n\"We saw the true danger of the FCC's net neutrality repeal when Verizon was caught throttling California firefighters,\" said digital rights group Fight for the Future.\nLet\u2019s unpack that statement, starting with the California fire.\nUsing tech to fight fires\nGolden State firefighters are still working to contain the largest blaze in state history. The Mendocino Complex Fire began burning in Northern California in late July, and so far has torched over 726,000 acres \u2014 more than double the size of Los Angeles.\nFirefighters from around the state have been called to action. Among the out-of-town responders were firefighters from Santa Clara County, located in the center of Silicon Valley, about 160 miles south of the inferno.\nThe Santa Clara County fire department deployed a high-tech truck, known in firefighter jargon as an \"Incident Support Unit,\" to serve as a command-and-control center.\n\nTo work effectively, the trucks need a robust Internet signal. Its broadband hookup is used to power software like Google Sheets, which lets firefighters coordinate real-time responses.\nBut in the midst of battling the largest fire in California history, the Santa Clara County truck\u2019s Internet speed suddenly slowed to a crawl. At roughly 1/200 the original speed, firefighters would have been no worse off using a dial-up modem from the 1990s.\nSo what the heck was happening?\n\"(We)\u00a0discovered the data connection was being throttled by Verizon,\" Fire Chief Anthony Bowden said in a statement filed as part of an ongoing lawsuit against the FCC. \"These reduced speeds severely interfered with the unit\u2019s ability to function effectively.\n\"Even small delays in response translate into devastating effects,\" he added, \"including loss of property, and, in some cases, loss of life.\"\nThe throttling persisted for some time even after the firefighters complained to Verizon and told the company of their urgent need to have fast Internet restored.\nVerizon later apologized for the incident. The restrictions were in place because the firefighters had a contract that said excess data usage was subject to significantly slowed-down speeds.\nBut the company said it failed to comply with its own internal policy of taking its foot off the brake during emergencies.\n\"In supporting first responders in the Mendocino fire, we didn\u2019t live up to our own promise of service and performance excellence when our process failed some first responders on the line, battling a massive California wildfire,\" Verizon said in a statement. \"For that, we are truly sorry.\"\nThe public relations fiasco drove Verizon to vow not to throttle west coast firefighters and some other first responders. \u00a0\nBut that olive branch had limited reach. For some, the incident was the most clear-cut demonstration of the shortcomings of industry self-policing in the post-net neutrality era.\nInstead of after-the-fact corporate damage control, they argue, what\u2019s needed is to put the law back on the books.\nWhat is net neutrality anyways?\nSo would Verizon\u2019s conduct have been unlawful and punishable under net neutrality? That\u2019s the main thrust of Fight for the Future\u2019s statement.\nFor the purposes of this fact-check, you need to bear in mind a couple of net neutrality\u2019s key features. (See a more detailed explainer here.) A core idea behind net neutrality is that virtually all content will travel unimpeded around the same speed.\n\"Usually, when one thinks of a net neutrality violation, one thinks of the violation of the no blocking, no throttling, and no paid prioritization rules,\" said Blair Levin, who served as chief of staff to the FCC chairman from 1993 through 1997.\nOf those three rules, we\u2019re concerned here with only one: the ban on throttling. That rule generally prohibited Internet service providers, or ISPs, from slowing down customers\u2019 speeds.\nHowever, to give ISPs flexibility in designing service plans that would avoid network congestion, the FCC carved out an exception. ISPs could offer plans that would allow willing customers to be throttled if they exceeded their data cap.\n\n"}
{"label": "false", "claim": "Anonymous GOP critics Commerce Secretary nominee John Bryson \"appears to endorse world government.\"", "evidence": "Supporting climate change policy is one thing, but is Barack Obama\u2019s nominee for commerce secretary, John Bryson, an advocate for world government?\n\nThat's the speculation raised by anonymous GOP sources on Capitol Hill, according to the conservative website the Daily Caller.\n\nBryson, former chief executive officer and chairman of Southern California energy conglomerate Edison International and co-founder of the Natural Resources Defense Council, has been under fire due to his support for clean-energy legislation. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., called him an \"environmental extremist\" and Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., a global warming skeptic, says he fears Bryson would implement climate change policy that would hurt American businesses. Bryson's nomination is also opposed by Massachusetts Democrats, Reps. Barney Frank and John Tierney, because of the NRDC's fight for fishing-catch limits.\n\nBut the claim that Bryson supports a \"world government\" raises the rhetoric to a new level.\n\nThe speculation originated in a June 7, 2011, story in the Daily Caller that ran under the headline: \"Commerce nominee appears to endorse world government in video, Republicans say.\"\n\nHere's how the story begins:\n\u00a0\nDoes John Bryson, Barack Obama\u2019s nominee for commerce secretary, want a world government?\n\nCritics say a newly uncovered video of the nominee suggests that he does.\n\nIn the video \u2013 given to The Daily Caller by sources on Capitol Hill \u2013 Bryson refers to the 2009 United Nations climate negotiations in Copenhagen as \"the closest thing we have to a world governance organization,\" implying it provided the best model for imposing climate regulations on countries around the globe.\n\nBryson also boasts about his role as an adviser to the U.N. secretary general on climate change in the video.\n\nThe story includes a link to a 1-minute and 25-second clip of Bryson making a formal presentation to an unidentified group. Here's the fuller context from the attached video:\n\n\"I thought that one of the things that is, in my judgment, not as well covered in the press and not as well understood as it ought to be is the kind of global picture on addressing clean energy and climate change. One of the things that have been a particular pleasure for me over the last year is I\u2019ve been working as an adviser to the Secretary General of the United Nations on that subject. So I thought I would talk a little about that, talk a little about Copenhagen, a little bit about the global environmental and energy picture as I see it. Where we are. Where we might go. I thought I\u2019d start there\u2026So, let\u2019s start with Copenhagen. So Copenhagen, obviously the United Nations is the global entity, the closest thing we have to a world governance organization. Copenhagen negotiations take place under the auspices of the United Nations as does the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), the side of the body that\u2019s developed this growing consensus about the effects of carbon emissions, greenhouse gas emissions on climate change.\"\n\nThat seems like pretty flimsy evidence on which to base speculation that Bryson \"appears to endorse world government.\" So we contacted Daily Caller reporter John Rossomando to find out who provided the video and made the claims. Rossomando wrote back that, \"it came from GOP officials on the Hill, of whom I am not a liberty to name.\"\n\nWe tracked the origin of the video to a presentation Bryson made at an energy symposium hosted by the University of California Berkeley on March 4, 2010. It's actually about an hour-long speech, with a brief Q & A, which you can watch here.\n\nIn the passage in question (at about the 10-minute mark), Bryson was talking about the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference, commonly known as the Copenhagen Summit, and the perception that nothing was accomplished because no treaty was reached.\n\nBryson made a case that, actually, they did accomplish a good deal. Although it fell short of the binding pact hoped for by many environmental groups, the summit produced a nonbinding emissions deal knows as the Copenhagen Accord.\n\nAccording to a New York Times account on Dec. 20, 2009, \"The plan does not firmly commit the industrialized nations or the developing nations to firm targets for midterm or long-term greenhouse gas emissions reductions. The accord is nonetheless significant in that it codifies the commitments of individual nations to act on their own to tackle global warming.\"\n\n\"That means there was no binding legal obligations that came out of what happened in Copenhagen,\" Bryson said in his Berkeley address. \"...But those are nonetheless commitments on behalf of the leaders of those countries.\"\n\n\"Certainly bringing the nations of the world together around addressing climate change and moving toward consensus and effective agreement on working together is vitally important,\" Bryson said.\n\nBryson talked about the need to think about climate change on a global basis, but at no point did he advocate for ceding power to the United Nations, let alone advocating anything as extreme as creating a world government.\n\nBrian Darling, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation who was quoted in the Daily Caller story, said it may be a rhetorical stretch to suggest that Bryson was advocating a world government. However, Darling said, what Bryson said on the video is of concern. Bryson seems to suggest that he supports giving the U.N. \"authority to impose climate change policy on other countries.\" At the least, he said, Bryson ought to be questioned by Congress about the video and made to explain his position.\n\nMyron Ebell, a climate-change skeptic at the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute, said the portion of the clip posted by the Daily Caller \"implies that (Bryson) supports global governing institutions. That is, he supports Kyoto and successor agreements to require mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. These international agreements are administered by an institution, the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), that is administered by the UN, which Bryson says is 'the closest thing we have to a world governance organization.'\u00a0 Supporting the Kyoto Protocol thus seems to imply that he supports some sort of world governance organization. But not quite necessarily.\"\n\nHowever, Ebell said, \"supporting some global institutions that govern some aspects of life is not the same as supporting world government.\" To suggest the clip is evidence that Bryson supports a world government is a \"stretch,\" he said. \"I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to learn that he does, but more evidence is required to establish what he really believes or supports.\u00a0 I think that what we do know about Mr. Bryson already is sufficient to disqualify him to be Secretary of Commerce from our perspective, which is why we oppose his confirmation.\"\n\nWe contacted the White House press office to see where Bryson stands on the whole \"world government\" issue, but they declined to comment, saying the fuller context of Bryson's statement -- even in the short clip on the Daily Caller site -- is enough to definitively refute the claim.\n\nWe agree. Referring to the United Nations as \"the closest thing we have to a world governance organization\" isn't exactly a smoking gun. We didn't hear any evidence in Bryson's full, hour-long address that suggests he wants to cede the U.S. government's authority over climate change policy to the United Nations, let alone something as radical and all-encompassing as a world government. No wonder the GOP officials who leaked the video and provided the speculation decided to remain anonymous"}

This is the story of how the president mangled government models of the storm to blow the forecast way out of proportion and misinform Americans.\u00a0\nThe White House did not answer our questions\nBut by the end of the day the White House issued a statement by Rear Admiral Peter J. Brown, Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Advisor, who defended Trump. Brown said that he shared with Trump the spaghetti models that showed possible storm impacts outside the official forecast cone and that forecasts showed the possibility of tropical storm force winds hitting Alabama.\nDoubling down on Alabama\u2019s overblown risk\nOver several days, Trump heard criticism from the media and meteorologists about his weekend warnings that even Alabama would \"get a piece of\" Dorian or \"will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated.\"\nSo, as he briefed reporters on the latest updates Sept. 4, he asked acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin K. McAleenan to display a chart of the \"original\" forecast.\u00a0\n#Sharpiegate was born: The hurricane\u2019s cone had been extended in black ink to include a section of southeast Alabama, even though it didn\u2019t match anything produced by the government\u2019s hurricane forecasters.\u00a0\nSpeaking again to reporters Sept. 4, Trump said he \"didn\u2019t know\" who altered the map. Trump also had this to say, alluding to yet another model that he thought would prove his point:\u00a0\n\"I know that Alabama was in the original forecast. They thought it would get it as a piece of it. It was supposed to go \u2014 actually, we have a better map than that, which is going to be presented, where we had many lines going directly \u2014 many models \u2014 each line being a model.\u00a0 And they were going directly through. And, in all cases, Alabama was hit \u2014 if not lightly, in some cases pretty hard. Georgia, Alabama \u2014 it was a different route. They actually gave that a 95% chance probability.\"\nForecasters did not give Alabama a 95% chance of being hit, and the \"better map\" Trump shared hours later in a tweet also did not show most models hitting Alabama.\nCase not closed\nTrump\u2019s tweet showed an Aug. 28 model of spaghetti plots for the hurricane\u2019s path appearing in countless jiggly lines aimed at the southeastern United States.\n\"This was the originally projected path of the Hurricane in its early stages.

While the State Department facilitated the paperwork for the medical evacuations, these people arrived in a private chartered jet paid for by the religious charities they worked for, Serving in Mission and Samaritan\u2019s Purse. At a news conference, Bruce Johnson, the president of Serving in Mission USA, said his group has spent about $1 million on the two patients since their illness was discovered.\nSecond, and\u00a0more important for this fact-check, is what the executive order says. It's much more\u00a0targeted than the article describes, it isn\u2019t aimed at Ebola, and while it allows health officials to quarantine someone with a highly contagious disease, it does not mandate\u00a0it.\nOn July 31, Obama modified a 2003 executive order from President George W. Bush. The original listed the communicable diseases for which the Department of Health and Human Services was authorized to issue an isolation or quarantine order. Bush specifically mentioned Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a disease associated with \"fever and signs and symptoms of pneumonia or other respiratory illness.\"\nObama updated the particular reference to SARS to include a broader array of possible respiratory illnesses. The new text reads as follows:\n\"Severe acute respiratory syndromes, which are diseases that are associated with fever and signs and symptoms of pneumonia or other respiratory illness, are capable of being transmitted from person to person, and that either are causing, or have the potential to cause, a pandemic, or, upon infection, are highly likely to cause mortality or serious morbidity if not properly controlled. This subsection does not apply to influenza.\"\nTo be clear, the update has nothing to do with Ebola or the current outbreak. Ebola is not a respiratory disease (the most prominent signs are diarrhea and vomiting) and the original 2003 executive order already listed Ebola.\nThe White House press office told PunditFact that the change was aimed at Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), an illness with symptoms that do match the updated executive order.\n\n"}
{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Charlie Flemming Georgia crackdown on illegal immigration costs state farmers $400 million last year.", "evidence": "Georgia labor leader Charlie Flemming took the microphone at a May 1 rally at the state Capitol to talk about the challenges facing working people around the world and ended up taking on the state\u2019s new immigration law.\n\n\"I was trying to stay away from that,\" Flemming said. But concerns about HB 87 -- Georgia\u2019s immigration law -- were too hot a topic not to mention, he said.\n\nA Morris News Service article about the rally attributed to him a claim that the legislation cost farmers $400 million last year.\n\n\"I said, \u2018close to $400 million,\u2019 \" said Flemming, president of the Georgia AFL-CIO.\n\nFlemming said he got the number from an Oct. 4 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which itself was based on a University of Georgia study commissioned by the Georgia Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association.\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty big number and raises a couple of questions: Is the number right and are the losses attributable to the new immigration bill?\n\nWe tracked down report co-author John McKissick, a UGA distinguished professor of agriculture marketing emeritus, to explain the report.\n\nMcKissick said he and co-author Sharon Kane surveyed 189 farmers representing nearly half the state\u2019s acreage for seven fruit and vegetable crops about their labor troubles during last spring\u2019s harvest. The crops -- including blueberries, onions and watermelons -- were chosen because they are \"most dependent on timely seasonal harvest.\"\n\nThe results showed an acute labor shortage cost those farmers just under $75 million.\n\nSince the sample size was so large -- 46.4 percent of the state\u2019s total acreage in those crops -- McKissick said it is fair to project the direct cost to farmers was about $140 million. The report couches that conclusion because responses to the survey were voluntary, but McKissick feels confident the projection is valid.\n\n\"It wasn\u2019t a random survey,\" he said. \"But you rarely ever get a survey that covers that amount of acreage.\"\n\nSo, if the impact to farmers was $140 million, where did Flemming get his figure?\n\nAlong with the direct impact on farmers, the UGA report projected an indirect impact of the lost harvest on the rest of the state\u2019s economy. Truck drivers, grocery store workers, even accountants get hurt indirectly when crops don\u2019t get to market, McKissick said.\n\nThe report calculated both the direct (to the farmers) and indirect (to the rest of us) impacts of the labor shortage to be $391 million. That\u2019s the \"close to $400 million\" that Flemming got from the AJC article he scanned on his way to the rally.\n\nFor the record, the AJC article reported the projected loss was for the entire state economy, not just farmers. Flemming said he may have misread the story before speaking, but he said the larger point remains.\n\n\"It was a significant hit for our state,\" he said. \"This law has cost the state a lot of money. It\u2019s hurt and is continuing to hurt.\"\n\nThat\u2019s the second question: Is HB 87 the culprit?\n\nThe UGA report is based on losses from the spring harvest -- which is the largest and most significant harvest in the state for fruits and veggies. But HB 87 did not take effect until July 1, so how could it have caused the shortage?\n\nThat\u2019s conjecture, McKissick said, but it is not that hard to make the connection.\n\n\"The bill had been passed, but even though it had not gone into effect, it created an atmosphere where people had a lot of questions,\" he said.\n\nThe report itself does not draw that conclusion, but McKissick said both the labor shortage and legislative promises to crack down on illegal immigrants occurred simultaneously.\n\nA follow-up study has not been done, but McKissick said he expects the economic ripples will continue as farmers cut back on their spring crop acreage.\n\n\"We did ask in the survey whether or not the results of the labor shortage would impact their production decisions for the fall and the following year\u2019s crop,\" he said. \"There was a good number that said it would affect their decisions, so there probably is a multiyear impact.\"\n\nSo Flemming was wrong in attributing the entire loss to farmers, but he was in the neighborhood when he said agricultural losses were about $400 million if you count indirect losses. It is impossible to say with absolute certainty that HB 87 caused the labor problem, although McKissick and others believe the two are linked.\n\nThere are a couple of problems with Flemming\u2019s statement. It\u2019s not completely clear that HB 87 is responsible for all of the farm losses. But even if it is, the amount of those losses if far less than he stated.\n\nThere\u2019s a kernel of truth to what he said. But just a kernel"}

{"label": "false", "claim": "Rush Limbaugh President Barack Obama shut down NASA space flights and turned the agency \"into a Muslim outreach department.\"", "evidence": "During an epic rant about liberal laziness and the events in Ukraine, conservative radio pundit Rush Limbaugh made a striking claim about NASA\u2019s new role under President Barack Obama.\nHow liberal laziness, Ukraine and NASA are related is a bit convoluted, so we\u2019ll keep this recap short and sweet. Limbaugh was going off on a Huffington Post blog written by Carolyn Gregoire. In her post, Gregoire criticized a Cadillac commercial as over-materialistic.\nHere\u2019s what Limbaugh said on his March 6 show:\n\"Hey, Ms. Gregoire, never mind that Barack Obama made NASA into a Muslim outreach department and it's Barack Obama, your idol and hero, that makes it necessary to pay the Russians $70 million for every astronaut to the space station,\" Limbaugh said.\n\"By the way, with this thing in the Ukraine, with the KGB vs. Obama, i.e., ACORN, what happens if Putin says, \u2018You know what, you really ticked me off and I'm not taking you back to your space station.\u2019 How we gonna get there, Ms. Gregoire? 'Cause Obama's shut it down. NASA's a museum for Muslim outreach now.\"\nThere\u2019s obviously some hyperbole in Limbaugh\u2019s comments here.

But we\u2019re fairly certain the origin of his \"Muslim outreach\" claim stems from the summer 2010 news cycle. New NASA chief Charles Bolden made a curious remark about Obama\u2019s three-pronged vision for Bolden\u2019s job description in an interview with Middle Eastern news channel Al Jazeera.\nObama had made improving relations with the Middle East a priority in his first campaign and traveled to Egypt for an historic address to the Muslim world in July 2009. To commemorate the one-year anniversary of that speech, Bolden told Al Jazeera the following in Cairo (video):\n\"When I became the NASA administrator, (President Obama) charged me with three things. One, he wanted me to help re-inspire children to want to get into science and math; he wanted me to expand our international relationships; and third, and perhaps foremost, he wanted me to find a way to reach out to the Muslim world and engage much more with dominantly Muslim nations to help them feel good about their historic contribution to science, math and engineering.\"\nMonths earlier, Bolden brought up NASA\u2019s goal of working with \"non-traditional\" allies, such as Indonesia, in a talk with engineering students, according to the Orlando Sentinel.\nWe wanted to know what other ground Bolden covered during the Al Jazeera interview, but we could not find a full-length transcript and video. So we turned to other recaps. A 2010 PolitiFact Texas fact-check on this topic pointed out Bolden also spoke of NASA\u2019s focus on international exploration of deep space and using robots to knock human race-threatening asteroids away from Earth. An ABC News synopsis said Bolden said his mission was not about diplomacy but expanding international relationships for \"tangible reasons,\" such as traveling to Mars.\nStill, Bolden\u2019s comment about reaching out to Muslim nations struck conservative talking heads and politicians as bizarre. Fox News commentator Charles Krauthammer said Bolden\u2019s remarks signaled \"a new height of fatuousness.\" Former NASA Administrator Michael Griffin, who served during the George W. Bush administration, called it a \"perversion\" of NASA\u2019s purpose. Limbaugh was mad back then, too.\nThe White House clarified Bolden\u2019s remarks as outrage swelled, with spokesman Robert Gibbs saying, \"That was not his task, and that's not the task of NASA.\"\n\n"}

O\u2019Malley, head of the Democratic Governor\u2019s Association, lauded the president\u2019s \"choices and policies.\"\n\nMcDonnell criticized O\u2019Malley\u2019s proposals this year that Maryland raise its income tax on top earners, as well as increase levies on gas and cigars. McDonnell boasted that Virginia\u2019s 6.2 percent unemployment rate trumps Maryland\u2019s 6.9 percent rate.\n\nO\u2019Malley corrected McDonnell; Maryland\u2019s rate was 6.7 percent in December, the most recent figures available.\n\n\"And we\u2019re creating jobs at 2 \u00bd times the rate Virginia is,\" O\u2019Malley said.\n\nWe\u2019ll stipulate O\u2019Malley is correct about about his state\u2019s unemployment rate. But his claim that Maryland is creating jobs at 2 \u00bd times the pace of Virginia was news to us. So we checked it out.\n\nRaquel Guillory, O\u2019Malley\u2019s chief of communications, told us her boss\u2019s statement was based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. She sent us two sets of BLS numbers to back O\u2019Malley\u2019s claim. The data compared seasonally-adjusted employment figures in Maryland and Virginia.\n\nIn January 2011, Maryland had 2,508,300 non-farm jobs. The number rose by 30,300 in December, to 2,538,600. That\u2019s a 1.21 percent increase.\n\nVirginia had 3,641,100 non-farm jobs in January 2011. The number rose by 22,000 in December, to \u00a03,663,100. That\u2019s an 0.6 percent increase.\n\nMaryland\u2019s rate of increase, under O\u2019Malley\u2019s formula, would be two times Virginia\u2019s rate.\n\nThe second set of numbers compared private-sector employment.\n\nIn January 2011, Maryland had 2,011,900 private jobs. The number rose by 25,600 in December, to 2,037,500. That\u2019s a 1.27 percent increase.\n\nVirginia had 2,941,200 private jobs in January 2011. The number rose by 15,900 in December, to 2,957,100. That\u2019s an 0.54 percent increase.\n\nSo Maryland\u2019s rate of increase, under O\u2019Malley\u2019s formula, would be roughly 2-1/3 times Virginia\u2019s rate.\n\nDo O\u2019Malley\u2019s numbers prove Maryland is outperforming Virginia?\n\nTerry Rephann, a regional economist with the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia, questioned O\u2019Malley\u2019s methodology of comparing the first month of 2011 with the last. He said economists usually compare job numbers from the same month over a period of years to remove any possibility of seasonal distortion, such as Christmas or summer employment.\n\nKara Markley, a mid-Atlantic regional economist with the BLS, made a similar observation. \"We would typically compare the same month year-to-year with the not seasonally-adjusted data,\" she said.\n\nThat data paints a far different picture from the one O\u2019Malley framed.\n\nIn December 2011, Maryland added 24,700 \u00a0jobs to its 2,529,300 tally from the previous December -- a 0.98 percent increase. Virginia added 35,600 jobs to its total of 3,644,500 from 2010 -- an 0.97 percent increase.\n\nBy that method, Maryland\u2019s job creation rate topped Virginia by 1/100th of 1 percent.\n\nUsing the same month-to-month method, we ran a comparison for all of 2010 and 2011. Virginia came out ahead in eight months, Maryland did better in four.\n\nHoward Wial, an economist at the Brookings Institution, said monthly employment numbers from each state are voluble and can be greatly impacted by the hiring or firing decisions of a single corporation.\n\nSo who\u2019s the better job creator, Maryland or Virginia? O\u2019Malley or McDonnell?\n\nRephann said these are complicated questions that would require many years of data, and analyses of policies and the impact of federal employment in each state.\n\n\"I don\u2019t know how you could demonstrate, over a given year, which state had the better policies,\" he said.\n\nTime and again, economists have told us politicians take far too much credit for job gains and assign far to much blame for losses. The O\u2019Malley-McDonnell squabble evoked the same response.\n\n\"Governor\u2019s really don\u2019t control their economies,\" Wial said.\n\n\"It\u2019s political theater,\" Rephann said.\n\nOur ruling:.\n\nO\u2019Malley said Maryland is creating jobs at 2\u00bd times the rate of Virginia.\n\nHe based his statement on the two state\u2019s employment numbers in January and December of 2011 and comparing the percentages of increase. Maryland came out ahead under O\u2019Malley\u2019s formula, but not quite by the magnitude the governor claimed.\n\nTwo economists told us better measurements would come from comparing unadjusted job figures from the same month in different years. Under this formula, using numbers from December 2010 and December 2011, the two states essentially came out even. When we compared each month in 2010 to its counterpart in 2011, Virginia usually came out ahead of Maryland.\n\nSo O\u2019Malley\u2019s claim only approaches validity when he gets to cherry-pick the data"}

The United States Army Field Manual warns that information gathered by torture can be faulty.\nThat's because, during torture, truth becomes irrelevant. And when the interrogators don't know if the information is true, the torture may continue even if the detainee tells the truth. At that point, the captive will fabricate information with the goal of telling the interrogator what he wants to hear.\n\"It is enormously well documented (including by the Senate study of the CIA program) that torture generated enormous amounts of false statements,\" said Lisa Hajjar,\u00a0a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who studies torture. (More about the Senate study in a bit.)\nOne example was the case of Abu Zubaydah, initially billed by the Bush administration as al-Qaida's chief of operations. Waterboarded 83 times, he told tales of planned attacks on shopping malls, nuclear power plants and the Brooklyn Bridge. Critics say that's because he knew little. Joining al-Qaida after 9/11, he scheduled people to move in and out of training camps and was mentally challenged.\nBefore the invasion of Iraq, the Bush administration said it had \"information that Iraq had been training al-Qaida operatives in the use of chemical weapons, thus connecting Iraq to 9/11,\" said Hajjar\u00a0in a review article in the Annual Review of Law and Social Science. \"This information was extracted by torture from a Libyan prisoner, Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, who subsequently recanted the lies he had told interrogators to make the pain stop.\"\nBad truth detectors\nInterrogators aren\u2019t particularly good at telling when someone under torture is lying or telling the truth.\n\"Interrogators in these situations think they're perfect lie detectors but research tells us quite differently,\" said Darius Rejali, a torture expert at Reed College in Oregon. Special training programs designed to enhance that ability \"make the interrogators more confident that they can detect the truth, but in fact they would be better off flipping a coin.\"\nIn the current war on terror, consider the case of Hassan Ghul. After his capture, he was cooperative without being tortured and provided information key to finding Osama bin Laden through bin Laden's associate, Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti. But after he cooperated,\u00a0the CIA decided to torture Ghul anyway. It produced no useful additional intelligence.\n\"The people who do know something will lie whether you torture them or not. The problem comes when you pull people in who don't know anything, and they're claiming that they do,\" said Rejali.\nThat opens the door to all kinds of fanciful intelligence from crazed-from-torture\u00a0informants.\n\n"}
{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Karen Handel \"Obamacare will provide coverage for abortions, despite the president\u2019s commitment that it would not.\"", "evidence": "In her new book, former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel said she was the target of a left-wing conspiracy that cost Handel her job last year at Susan G. Komen for the Cure, one of the nation\u2019s leading breast cancer prevention organizations.\n\nThe main conspirators, Handel wrote, were top officials at Planned Parenthood, who blamed her for Komen\u2019s plans to end funding to their organization. She also claimed the White House was a co-conspirator for a few reasons, such as Handel\u2019s claim that Planned Parenthood\u2019s political arm is a major fundraising source for the Democratic Party. \n\nThe book, \"Planned Bullyhood,\" lays out Handel\u2019s case, including a claim PolitiFact Georgia found interesting. Handel wrote that Planned Parenthood will receive millions of dollars in grants under the federal government\u2019s health care law, which conservatives derisively call \"Obamacare.\"\n\n\"[M]ost disturbing, is the fact that Obamacare will provide coverage for abortions, despite the president\u2019s commitment that it would not,\" Handel, a Republican, wrote on page 161 of the book.\n\n\"Under a rule issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, insurance plans within the state health exchanges are required to cover abortions,\" wrote Handel, the former chairwoman of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners, who narrowly lost the GOP gubernatorial runoff in 2010.\n\nHandel resigned her position as vice president of policy at Komen earlier this year.\n\nHandel\u2019s statement contained two claims we wanted to fact-check: Does the health care law provide a means for coverage for abortions, and does the law provide such coverage despite President Barack Obama\u2019s commitment that it would not?\n\nHandel surrogates sent us several documents to support her claim. A National Right to Life official also sent us materials on her behalf to argue her statement is accurate.\n\n\"I think the gist of what she\u2019s saying is correct,\" said Douglas Johnson, the Washington-based organization\u2019s legislative director.\n\nA U.S. Department of Health and Human Services weblink, though, contradicts Handel\u2019s claim that the law provides coverage for abortions. It says the health care law does not pay for abortions, citing a decades-old federal policy called the Hyde Amendment. Obama signed an executive order in the health care law including language from the amendment stating \"federal funds are not used for abortion services [except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered].\"\n\nIf a state chooses to, it can use its own funds to cover abortions in certain other circumstances, and states will continue to have this option under the health care law.\n\nThe health care law creates exchanges: new organizations designed to create a more organized and competitive market for buying health insurance. Starting in 2014, exchanges will serve primarily individuals buying insurance on their own and small businesses with up to 100 employees, though states can choose to include larger employers in the future.\n\nSo, can women get abortions through the exchanges? It depends.\n\nState governments can restrict insurance coverage for abortion in the health care exchanges. Some states have already made plans to do so.\n\n\"That\u2019s about the only positive thing that came out of [the health care law],\" Johnson said.\n\nIf the state does not bar coverage of abortions, private insurers can offer a plan that covers abortions beyond the federal limitations within an exchange. No private insurer will be forced to cover abortion, our partners at PolitiFact have noted.\n\nThe health care law outlines a methodology for states to follow to ensure that no federal funds are used toward coverage for abortions beyond the Hyde Amendment. Any plan that covers abortions beyond Hyde limitations must estimate the actuarial value of such coverage by taking into account the cost of the abortion benefit (valued at $1 or more per enrollee per month).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\"Before choosing a health plan, consumers will know whether the plan covers these services,\" Erin Shields, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, was quoted as saying in The Huffington Post. \"And if it does, payments will be made into a separate account to ensure no federal dollars fund these services.\"\n\nHandel has a different description of how this works.\n\n\"The new rule requires that an individual enrolled in one of these plans pay a separate fee of at least one dollar \u2014 an abortion surcharge. The abortion surcharge is paid directly to the abortion\nfund, going to an account that is separate from the monthly insurance premium. Why two separate accounts? It\u2019s the Obama administration\u2019s cunning and deceptive way to circumvent the prohibition of federal funds going to abortion \u2014 and no doubt, Planned Parenthood,\" she wrote.\n\nJohnson said he and other organizations agree with Handel\u2019s interpretation of this funding provision.\n\nAs for whether the president had committed to prohibiting abortion coverage in the health care law, that part is clearer. PolitiFact reported that Obama told some conservative Democrats in Congress uneasy about voting for the health care law \"there will be no public funding of abortion in this legislation.\" He also signed an executive order on March 24, 2010, that \"federal funds are not used for abortion services [except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered].\"\n\nSeveral leading abortion rights organizations were disappointed with the plan to include the Hyde Amendment into the health care law.\n\nCecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood, put out a statement opposing the deal.\n\n\"Planned Parenthood strongly opposes the new abortion language offered by Senator Ben Nelson in the manager's amendment,\" she said. \"[I]t is a sad day when women\u2019s health is traded away for one vote.\"\n\nObama did say and signed an executive order that committed to no federal funding for abortion in the health care law. Handel\u2019s claim that the law will provide coverage for abortions could have been made more precisely. States can bar all plans participating in the state exchanges from covering abortions. That\u2019s not mentioned in Handel\u2019s book.\n\nBasically, abortions can be performed under the health care law, depending on which state you reside in"}

The union represents heavy equipment operators and mechanics and industrial machinery operators.\nIn an email, Giorgio described Local 150 as a \"Madigan-aligned labor group.\"\nBut Marc Poulos, executive director of the PAC, said it has donated to Democrats and Republicans alike who support road building and other construction projects. Ives, he noted, backed a constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2016 that barred state officials from diverting transportation related tax revenue for other purposes. The group contributed most of its money to Ives before she announced her run for governor.\nSince 2010, the union PAC has given $13.9 million to Democrats and Republicans, state records show. Four political committees controlled by Madigan, including the Democratic Party of Illinois, have received more than $1 million from the labor group. But Republican legislative leaders, as well as rank-and-file GOP lawmakers like Ives, also received money.\nState records show that since 2010, the Local 150 PAC has showered $45,000 in campaign cash on current state Senate Republican leader Bill Brady of Bloomington, who is backing Rauner in the primary. Brady recorded receiving $5,000 of that as recently as March 1 at a time the Rauner attack ad on Ives was already airing.\nAnother $32,000 in Local 150-connected donations have also been directed to Senate Republican caucus whip Karen McConnaughay of St. Charles.\nMeanwhile, House Republican leader Jim Durkin has been the recipient of $170,500 in Local 150 PAC donations since 2010, though the money flow has stopped in the current election cycle when the union broke with Durkin and began actively trying to defeat him.\n\n"}

Bush\u2019s victory over Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election. Russert and host Matt Lauer discussed a map that had a red-and-blue color scheme. Up to then, there had been no consensus and some media identified Democratic states as red and Republican states as blue.\nHow states vote for president, in the most recent election or the last several presidential contests, has become a common way to identify states as blue or red.\nViewed narrowly, Wisconsin is blue, having voted for the Democratic nominee in each of the last seven presidential contests. Over the past five decades, only two Republicans, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, have won Wisconsin. (Nixon won in 1960, 1968 and 1972, and Reagan won in 1980 and 1984).\nLimbaugh spokeswoman Rachel Nelson said Limbaugh based the blue-state part of his claim on the fact that Wisconsin hadn\u2019t voted for the GOP presidential nominee since \u201884.\nBut calling Wisconsin \"one of the bluest\" states suggests it\u2019s an automatic in the Democratic column, when in fact it has often been a presidential battleground. Four months before the 2012 election, for example, Politico listed Wisconsin as one of nine swing states; days before the vote, the New York Times listed Wisconsin as one of just six swing states. \u00a0\nAnd on other measures, Wisconsin isn\u2019t clearly blue at all.\n\n"}

Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch thrusts toward the camera a football autographed by Bart Starr, the legendary Green Bay Packers quarterback.\n\nKleefisch talks about the value of signatures -- she says Starr\u2019s cost more than $300 -- and how much it will cost taxpayers if enough signatures are collected to force her and Gov. Scott Walker into recall elections in 2012.\n\nShe then says holding a statewide recall election would cost \"$7.7 million -- $7.7 million that may already be allocated to merit raises for teachers or health care for the poor or school books for your kids.\"\n\nThe cost of a statewide special election is a concern to many taxpayers, as is where that money would come from.\n\nSo let\u2019s check Kleefisch\u2019s claim.\n\nThe video was posted Nov. 15, 2011, the same day recall campaigns against both Walker and Kleefisch were launched. Organizers have until Jan. 14, 2012 to collect more than 540,000 valid signatures for each in order to force them into recall elections. Recall campaigns against four state senators are also in the works.\n\nLet\u2019s examine Kleefisch\u2019s statement in two parts -- her cost estimate and the sources of money she says might be used to pay for a statewide recall election.\n\nCost estimate\n\nIn the video, Kleefisch says her $7.7 million estimate is based on the $2.1 million it cost to hold recall elections for nine state senators in the summer of 2011.\n\nThose recalls, which included eight primary elections, did cost an estimated $2.1 million -- a figure based on a survey of local governments done by the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board, which oversees state elections.\n\nKleefisch took the $2.1 million estimate and applied it to all 33 Senate districts to come up with her $7.7 million figure for a statewide recall election, said Republican Party of Wisconsin spokeswoman Nicole Larson.\n\nOne can\u2019t assume that the average per-district cost of a recall election in the nine Senate districts would be the same for the other 24 districts.\n\nBut Kleefisch\u2019s basic math is accurate -- and her estimate might even be low.\n\nWalker himself has noted a $10 million estimate for a statewide recall made by state Rep. Robin Vos, R-Rochester, who requested the cost estimate for the Senate recalls. Vos said he also based his estimate on the cost of the summer recalls.\n\nAn official cost projection by the Government Accountability Board, also requested by Vos, is expected to be ready by the end of November 2011, said board spokesman Reid Magney.\n\nMagney would not comment on whether Kleefisch\u2019s $7.7 million or Vos\u2019 $10 million are good estimates. But Dan Thompson, executive director of the League of Wisconsin Municipalities, said he did a quick estimate and came up with $8 million.\n\nSources of money\n\nKleefisch claimed money to pay for a recall election \"may already be allocated to merit raises for teachers or health care for the poor or school books for your kids.\"\n\nLarson, the GOP spokeswoman, didn\u2019t provide evidence to back that claim. But she said the point of the video is that tax money that would be spent on a recall election \"could be used for worthy local causes.\"\n\nLet\u2019s analyze how elections, and other services, are funded.\n\nThe state funds schools and health care for the poor, but pays only a fraction of the cost of holding a recall election. Meanwhile, municipalities and counties, which pay the lion\u2019s share of election costs, don\u2019t fund schools.\n\nAnd the school districts, which would pay for merit raises and books, don\u2019t run the elections.\n\nSo, where would tax money to pay for a recall election come from?\n\nIn the Senate recalls, less than $90,000 of the $2.1 million estimated cost of running the elections was covered by the state, said Magney, the Government Accountability Board spokesman.\n\nThe first option to pay for the the state\u2019s share of a statewide recall election would be reserve funds controlled by the Legislature\u2019s Joint Finance Committee, said Robert Lang, director of the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau.\n\n(On Nov. 17, 2011, the Government Accountability Board notified the committee it would seek $650,000 just for reviewing recall petitions and other election preparations.)\n\nLang said the Joint Finance Committee has $267,000 in unreserved money that could be spent for recall costs. The committee could also tap $30 million in reserves that are targeted for, but not actually allocated to, specific programs such as correction officers\u2019 overtime, he said.\n\nSo, it\u2019s possible, as Kleefisch said, the state will need to tap funds that are at least designated for, if not obligated to, other programs.\n\nBut it\u2019s highly unlikely lawmakers would take money already allocated through the state budget to schools or health programs for the poor, Lang said, because the Joint Finance Committee \"cannot counter the intent of the Legislature.\"\n\nAs for local governments, cities, villages and counties will use reserve funds to pay for the recall election and it would be highly unlikely they would cut spending for other purposes, said Thompson of the municipalities league and John Reinemann, legislative director of the Wisconsin Counties Association.\n\nBoth said it is possible, however, there could be isolated cases of a municipality or county transferring funds from another program to pay for the election.\n\nSusan Edman, executive director of the Milwaukee Election Commission, estimates a recall election would cost the city $250,000 -- and another $250,000 if a primary also had to be held. Deputy City Clerk Jim Owczarski said the Common Council likely would be asked to pay for the recall from the city\u2019s $5 million contingency fund.\n\nAs for towns, many will tap reserves for the election, although those that don\u2019t have reserves or unspent money in other departments might have to cut spending in some areas, said Rick Stadelman, executive director of the Wisconsin Towns Association.\n\nSo, the thrust of Kleefisch\u2019s statement -- that the money to hold a recall election has to come from somewhere else -- is accurate, though the examples she cited are generally off point.\n\nOur conclusion\n\nKleefisch said a statewide recall will cost \"$7.7 million that may already be allocated to merit raises for teachers or health care for the poor or school books for your kids.\" Both of her claims are a mixed bag.\n\nKleefisch\u2019s cost figure is stated as fact, when the actual figure is not known, but it appears to be in the ballpark and might be conservative.\n\nOn her second point, Kleefisch provides no evidence that funds would be taken from allocations already made for schools or health care. But her broader point -- that money for the election might come from funds that are at least designated for other programs, is correct"}

By email, Chris Evans of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign pointed us to a Feb. 14, 2018, Facebook post by Lisa Guthrie, who describes herself on Facebook as a resident of Redmond, a suburb of Seattle, Wash.\nGuthrie\u2019s post says: \"At a recent PTA meeting, we brought in some of the police officers who work closely with our school district to talk about ALICE, which is their approach to handling active shooter situations.\" ALICE stands for Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter and Evacuate, a response to campus intruders developed by the Ohio-based ALICE Training Institute.\nGuthrie\u2019s post continues: \"One part of it is that if the shooter does enter the room where kids are at, the kids are told to run around, yell loudly, throw things like books or wads of paper, etc. Just be a distraction. At first I was like, really? You think a shooter armed with a machine gun is going to confront Samantha armed with a book and just say oh, never mind, I won't kill her? And then it punched me in the gut: If she's face to face with a shooter, she's going to die regardless. The goal will be for her and her classmates to make their deaths take 20 seconds rather than 10. That's 10 more seconds for other kids to run, 10 more seconds for first responders to get to the scene and take out the shooter. A lot of lives can be saved in 10 seconds...\n\n\"Just to be clear,\" Guthrie\u2019s post says, \"this is the current state of affairs: We live in a country where kindergartners learn how to maximize the number of lives they can save as they're being massacred.\"\nInstitute emphasizes actions to distract classroom intruders\nWe tried to message Guthrie on Facebook and didn\u2019t hear back. But separately Shannon Parthemer, a spokeswoman for the Lake Washington School District, which serves students from Redmond, east of Seattle, confirmed by email that district officials have worked with law officers to train staff and students with ALICE trainings offered to parents \"so they can better understand what ALICE is and how its principles can help increase odds of survival and minimize the loss of life in the event of an aggressive intruder.\"\nSchools hold ALICE drills, Parthemer said, with lessons modified based on kids\u2019 ages.\n\"For example, young students (like kindergarteners), do \u2018listening drills,\u2019\" Parthemer said. \"These drills ask them to listen to the instructions of their teacher for a set period of time. This is a principle that would be important in the event of a true active shooter situation.\" At least once a year, she wrote, \"our staff do an ALICE table-top exercise that allows them to talk through an active-shooter situation and determine what actions to take.\"\nThen again, Parthemer wrote, \"these elements are not taught in the manner characterized\" by O\u2019Rourke. Asked to elaborate, Parthemer stressed that the guidance that children distract an intruder comprises only part of the ALICE training. In elementary schools, Parthemer said, students \"are told to listen to their teacher and follow what the teacher asks them to do \u2013 lockdown, counter, evacuate, etc.\"\nParthemer otherwise connected us to Liz Hedreen, president of the Lake Washington PTSA Council, who responded by email that she didn\u2019t attend a meeting like the one described in the Facebook post; the district, Hedreen said, has 41 PTSA chapters \"and each one runs their own meetings, so I don't have specific knowledge about what topics they have covered.\" Hedreen said, though, she\u2019d heard a presentation about ALICE training at PTSA meetings at a local high school. Hedreen also pointed out a February 2018 district communication to parents mentioning the ALICE trainings.\nWhat the ALICE Institute says\nThe\u00a0institute says on its website that its training sessions \"increase your children\u2019s and employees\u2019 odds of survival during a violent intruder event. ALICE Training,\" the institute says, \"goes beyond lockdown methods by providing individuals with a new set of skills that will greatly increase their odds of survival during an active shooter situation.\"\nAn institute video presents founder Greg Crane, a former police officer, saying that locking down a classroom can be viable strategy when a shooter enters a campus. \"But it can\u2019t be the only response,\" Crane says. \"It is completely inadequate to teach people to only be passive and static when a determined attacker has decided they are his next victims.\"\nCrane elaborates: \"There are no guarantees in life and we cannot guarantee that nobody will be hurt in a planned determined attack. But we do guarantee that by doing something instead of nothing, you will greatly increase the chances of your survival.\"\nAnother video shows students and school employees acting out what they\u2019d do if an armed intruder entered their high school. The narrator says that after alerting others via the school\u2019s intercom system, students start to evacuate. Next, a teacher is seen telling students: \"Guys, you need to grab some books. If the intruder walks in, we have to throw them at him.\"\nThe narrator says that when an intruder enters the classroom, throwing books and desks and yelling and \"even charging the intruder gives yourself and your students a better chance to survive.\" Next, students throw books at a classroom intruder before rushing him and driving him to the floor:\n\n\n"}

Opponents have said a provision that clinics must upgrade to the standards of ambulatory surgical centers could lead 36 of 42 clinics that perform most Texas abortions to shut down.\nWhen we contacted the Democratic Party about Hinojosa\u2019s claim, spokeswoman Tanene Allison told us by email that although the chairman\u2019s San Antonio reference could be read as saying no El Paso facility would continue to provide such services, it was not intended that way.\nHinojosa \"does recognize that there may be other clinics open for these screenings in El Paso,\" Allison said.\n\"Our intention was to say that if you go to the clinics that are covered under HB2, you would have to drive 550 miles to get some of the services that you normally get locally,\" Allison said. \"We certainly could have been clearer and will be in future emails.\"\nStill, we checked on conditions in El Paso for ourselves.\nEl Paso, a city with 672,538 residents as of 2012, is at Texas\u2019 western edge, but it\u2019s not isolated. It\u2019s across the Rio Grande from the more than 1 million residents of Mexico\u2019s Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, and inside the U.S., it\u2019s closer to Albuquerque, N.M. (population 555,417) and the nation\u2019s sixth-largest city (Phoenix, population 1.5 million) than it is to San Antonio.\nTwo El Paso clinics could shutter if the measure becomes law, according to a July 10, 2013, El Paso Times news story. The clinics appear on a Department of State Health Services list of abortion facilities we received by email June 25, 2013. Reproductive Services of El Paso, near downtown, provides cancer screenings and other services, while Hill Top Women\u2019s Reproductive Clinic solely offers abortions and pregnancy tests, according to the clinics\u2019 websites. We called both clinics, but did not hear back.\nSo, if Reproductive Services were to shut down, would El Paso women have to drive 550 miles to get a test for cervical cancer?\n\"That\u2019s unbelievable. That\u2019s not possible. I don\u2019t even know where to start,\" said Adriana Valdes, co-director of outreach and case management at the Cancer and Chronic Disease Consortium, which manages El Paso clinics\u2019 participation in the state\u2019s Breast and Cervical Cancer Services program.\n\"There are a lot of organizations and institutions here that can provide access to those services,\" Valdes told us by phone. Lawmakers \"need to put all the facts together\" before making decisions that could affect funding for women\u2019s health \"coming into needy communities like ours,\" she said. \"Many towns and hospitals are committing their monies to diagnostic screenings and diagnostic services and none of them are providing abortion services.\"\nValdes said she was not aware of the two clinics listed as abortion facilities, but said that any time a facility closes, it has a big impact on the women in the area who rely on its services. \"We have central locations,\" she said. \"Those are not long distances.\" Access to transportation is a concern, she said, but the biggest issue can be making sure women know the services are available, especially with patients who get used to going to a single facility for years and don\u2019t know of other options.\nEducation and advice for such women is a main function of her organization, which subcontracts with 12 to 14 clinics and some private health care providers to help women get breast and cervical cancer screenings at low or no cost, Valdes said, and gives ongoing assistance to women diagnosed with cancer.\nThe clinics do not provide abortions, she said, and so would not be directly affected by the legislation, although it could mean more women would seek their \"already overwhelmed\" services.\nAccess to cervical cancer screenings in El Paso decreased when Planned Parenthood clinics in El Paso closed, we learned from Valdes and Theresa Byrd, a professor at Texas Tech University\u2019s Paul L. Foster School of Medicine in El Paso.\n\n"}

He meant that it surges in the region where the Super Bowl takes place and in the days surrounding the event. (This year, it\u2019s Feb. 1 in Phoenix.)\nBut as it turns out, there is very little empirical evidence that speaks to this oft-repeated claim -- even though there is some recent academic research on the topic. While there are news reports and anecdotal examples of sting operations in Super Bowl host cities, comparisons to the rest of the year are rare, making it hard to know whether there\u2019s a Super Bowl spike. \u00a0\nThe latest evidence\nWe spoke with Dominique Roe-Sepowitz, a social work professor at Arizona State University who is leading the latest academic research on sex trafficking around the Super Bowl. Her research intends to discover whether or not there is an increase in sex-trafficking events surrounding the Super Bowl and to further understand sex trafficking trends.\n(Sex trafficking is -- as defined by the Trafficking Victim Protection Act of 2000 -- \u00a0a circumstance \"in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age.\")\nRoe-Sepowitz\u2019s 2014 research used online escort ads to compare supply and demand for trafficking victims in New York City -- where the 2014 Super Bowl took place -- and used Phoenix as a control. During this weekend\u2019s Super Bowl, they are looking at the same two cities and will publish a report in the coming weeks.\nLast year, they reviewed online commercial sex ads in the New York and Phoenix metropolitan areas in the days leading up to and following the game. Out of nearly 1,000 ads in New York, 84 percent indicated possible sex trafficking. Among more than 1,300 ads in Phoenix, 80 percent indicated possible sex trafficking.\nRoe-Sepowitz said that so far, the research does not show correlation between the Super Bowl and higher levels of sex trafficking activity.\nThey found some evidence of \"victim movement and marketing trends that tend to correspond with the build up towards the Super Bowl\" -- traffickers responding to the influx of thousands of men with money to spend. But they did not find that the level of activity was necessarily higher than other weeks out of the year.\nOn the other hand, increased public attention on trafficking around the Super Bowl might mean that the frequency is lower than it would be otherwise.\n\n"}

Tim Pawlenty said President Barack Obama\u2019s first term was littered with broken promises.\n\n\"People won\u2019t be duped twice. He made huge promises to the country -- 10, 15 big promises and he\u2019s broken or left unfulfilled almost every one of them,\" Pawlenty said. \"Just a couple of quick examples: He said in 2009 early, \u2018I will reduce the deficit in half by the end of my first term.\u2019 Instead he\u2019s going to multiply it by two, three, four or five.\"\n\nWe raised our eyebrows.\n\nSo we checked in with Alex Conant, spokesman for the Pawlenty campaign, and asked him to provide some supporting evidence.\n\nConant cited a comment by Obama in February 2009 at the Fiscal Responsibility Summit in which \u00a0Obama said he was \"pledging to cut the deficit we inherited by half by the end of my first term in office. Now, this will not be easy. It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we've long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay, and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control.\"\n\nSo Pawlenty is right about the first part.\n\nAs for the second part of the statement, Conant pointed us to an estimate of federal debt from the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan agency that does official budget estimates.\n\n\"If you look at this CBO projection of federal debt, (Table 1, Page 2), you'll see that the publicly held debt will double with even the most generous revenue projections,\" Conant wrote. \"If revenues continue to stagnate, and businesses do not grow, the debt will grow by even larger margins.\"\n\nBut Pawlenty said \"deficit\" -- not \"debt.\" They are not the same thing. We inquired again but never heard back from Conant.\n\nHere's how they're different:\n\nThe deficit is the amount by which the government\u2019s spending exceeds its revenue for a given period, usually one year. The debt is the accumulation of the prior deficits.\n\nThere are actually two major ways of tabulating the debt. One is public debt, which includes all debt owed by the federal government and held by investors through Treasury notes and other securities. Another is gross federal debt, which includes public debt plus debt held by the government. The most notable forms of debt held by the government are the trust funds for Social Security and Medicare, money that is owed to beneficiaries in the future.\n\nThe \"debt held by the public,\" which Conant referenced, currently represents about two-thirds of the $14.4 trillion gross federal debt.\n\nIf you're measuring the deficit, Pawlenty\u2019s right that Obama hasn't yet fulfilled his promise -- at least according to the current projections for the end of his four-year term. The annual deficit was $1.4 trillion when he took office in 2009. In CBO's most recent projections from April, the deficit is projected to be $1.16 trillion in fiscal year 2012 and $901 billion in 2013. \u00a0\n\nSo he's got to cut a lot more from the budget in the next two years to achieve the goal.\n\nBut it was incorrect for Pawlenty to say the deficit will more than double. In fact, it is on track to go down, although possibly not as much as Obama promised.\n\nAnd even if Pawlenty meant \"debt,\" the facts don't support his claim. The publicly held debt is projected to continue growing -- from the $7.5 trillion in fiscal year 2009 to $12.66 trillion in 2013, which is less than double.\n\nDaniel Mitchell, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute, suggested that Pawlenty may have erred by using fiscal year 2008 as a starting point. The debt and deficit both roughly double if he were comparing 2008 to 2012.\n\nThe debt also doubles by the end of 2013 if you use, as a baseline, Obama's first full day in office -- Jan. 21, 2009 -- when the publicly held debt was $6.3 trillion.\n\nBut even then, Pawlenty\u2019s multipliers of \"three, four or five\" would be gross exaggerations.\n\nMarc Goldwein, an economist at the centrist New America Foundation, said it\u2019s more important to take in the big picture, rather a small sample of years, for analysis.\n\n\"The baseline should be -- what do we need to do to put the debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward path,\" Goldwein said. \"We can manipulate numbers however we want to show how deficits change, but the important thing is what deficits and debt are and will be.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nThere is some truth to Pawlenty\u2019s claim: Obama made a pledge to cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term. And he\u2019s falling short so far.\n\nBut there\u2019s a lot more of Pawlenty's statement that\u2019s wrong. The deficit, which should not be confused with the debt, is projected to decrease, not increase. And even if Pawlenty mixed up the words or used the incorrect fiscal year as a baseline, Pawlenty\u2019s suggestion that the deficit could multiply by \"two, three, four or five\" is not supported by the facts"}

ACORN's agenda includes left-leaning causes such as voter registration drives for low-income groups, initiatives to increase the minimum wage and programs offering help to victims of predatory lending.\n\n\nBy all indications, ACORN operates within the American political mainstream, though clearly it favors the left side of the ideological spectrum. Its voter registration efforts tend to focus on the low-income, minorities and youth, all traditional Democratic constituencies. Obama received an endorsement from the group's political action committee in February 2008 when the Democratic primaries were in full swing. But that's not to\u00a0say Republicans never support ACORN's efforts: McCain himself appeared at a 2006 rally in favor of immigration reform, sponsored in part by ACORN.\n\n\nThe primary allegation against ACORN is that its voter registration drives result in many phony registrations.

It includes such entitlement programs as Social Security and Medicare, veterans' benefits, food stamps, education and health programs.\n\nMandatory spending is about two-thirds of the total budget. The problem of dealing with the politically charged entitlements is why balancing the budget is so difficult.\n\nDiscretionary spending is the part of the budget governed by the annual appropriation process and debated by Congress.

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "TriMet \"Without Westside MAX, we\u2019d need to add 2.9 lanes to the Sunset Highway.\"", "evidence": "TriMet recently ran ads in some editions of The Oregonian claiming that \"without Westside MAX, we\u2019d need to add 2.9 lanes to the Sunset Highway.\" \n\nFor those drivers lucky enough not to experience the hell that is a Sunset Highway commute, know that TriMet is talking about the portion of U.S. 26 that carries vehicles between downtown Portland and Washington County. The lanes are jammed during commute hours, and we\u2019re pretty sure some drivers would love to add an extra 2.9 lanes anyway to relieve congestion.\n\nLight-rail trains parallel some of the highway, but not all of it. Our question was simple: We wanted to know how TriMet, the metro area\u2019s public transit agency, calculated the need to add 2.9 lanes of highway if not for westside MAX.\n\nTriMet spokeswoman Mary Fetsch got back to us with a calculation prepared by staff; the explanation clarified that the figure should be 2.7 lanes. (This is not the first time a query by PolitiFact Oregon has prompted a revised figure. There\u2019s just something about us that makes people correct themselves.)\n\nHere\u2019s the calculation:\n\nBasically, TriMet checked how many times a light-rail train went through the Washington Park station (westbound) and through the Sunset Transit Center station (eastbound) between 4:30 and 5:30 in the evening in Spring 2011. The total was 20 trips, or trains.\n\nEach two-car train can carry a maximum, or full load of, 266 people, according to TriMet. If you multiply 266 by 20 trains, that\u2019s a maximum 5,320 people on light-rail that pass through those points in that one-hour period. Compare that to the 2,052 people estimated in one highway lane over the hour. (That\u2019s using a standard 1,800 vehicles per hour multiplied by an occupancy rate of 1.14 people per auto during a commute. )\n\nSo the maximum number of people on MAX over that hour is equivalent to the number of people on 2.6 lanes. Hence 2.6 added lanes. Again, that was in spring 2011. TriMet added another train this spring, bringing the total number of trains to 21, which translates into the revised figure of 2.7 added lanes and a maximum capacity of 5,586 riders.\n\nNext, we turned to John Charles of the Cascade Policy Institute, who is the libertarian think tank\u2019s leading critic of light-rail transit.\n\nHe contested TriMet\u2019s claim on several fronts, including the theory that the analysis doesn\u2019t account for people who could have been carried by bus if TriMet hadn\u2019t reduced bus service for light-rail. But the most interesting suggestion he made was that maximum capacity doesn\u2019t matter; actual ridership matters.\n\nWe asked Fetsch for the number of riders on those trains.\n\nWeekday ridership for the 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. peak hour in spring 2012 averaged 1,673 westbound and 938 eastbound for a total of 2,611 riders. That\u2019s not close to the maximum capacity of 5,586 riders and, using TriMet\u2019s own calculations, comes to 1.3 added lanes.\n\nFetsch said TriMet\u2019s intent was not to suggest that they would need to build 2.7 lanes to the highway corridor, which probably isn\u2019t possible anyway unless you demolish some hills. \"Our intent was to describe the mobility capacity of MAX in terms that people could relate to who travel within that corridor,\" she wrote in an email.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what the ad says. It clearly states we would \"need to add\" lanes. That indicates that without westside MAX, we\u2019d need that many more lanes to maintain the traffic flow we have now.\n\nTriMet may have the capacity to carry the equivalent of 2.7 lanes, but that\u2019s not what the ad said.\n\nThere\u2019s an element of truth in the statement. TriMet can show a method by which it translates carrying capacity into highway lanes. TriMet may have the capacity to carry the equivalent of 2.7 lanes, but its trains weren\u2019t carrying anywhere near that many people at the time of the estimate"}

It found: \"Immigrants are in fact much less likely to commit crime than natives, and the presence of large numbers of immigrants seems to lower crime rates.\" The study added that \"This disparity also holds for young men most likely to be undocumented immigrants: Mexican, Salvadoran, and Guatemalan men.\"\nIt continued: \"Today, the belief that immigrants are more likely to commit crimes is perpetuated by \u2018issue entrepreneurs\u2019 who promote the immigrant-crime connection in order to drive restrictionist immigration policy.\"\nThe academy is a nonprofit research organization charged with providing independent advice to the nation. It is funded largely by the federal government.\nFindings in a\u00a0March 2017 study by the libertarian Cato Institute also support\u00a0Villaraigosa's statement:\n\"Illegal immigrants are 44 percent less likely to be incarcerated than natives. Legal immigrants are 69 percent less likely to be incarcerated than natives. Legal and illegal immigrants are underrepresented in the incarcerated population while natives are overrepresented.\"\nThe Cato study used information from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey\u00a0for\u00a0immigrants aged 18 to 54 who are incarcerated in the United States.\u00a0\nTo examine Villaraigosa's claim, we\u00a0also relied on research into similar claims by our partner national PolitiFact. In July 2016, it rated Mostly True a statement by Libertarian candidate for president Gary Johnson that Mexican immigrants \"are more law-abiding than U.S. citizens and that is a statistic.\"\nPolitiFact found several studies that back up this claim by citing incarceration rates. It also found groups that challenged those studies or said more research is needed.\nPolitiFact\u2019s findings\nPolitiFact pointed to a July 2015 report by the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigrant nonprofit in Washington. The council analyzed data from the Census\u2019 2010 American Community Survey and found that about 1.6 percent of all immigrant males (Census does not specify legal status) between 18 and 39 years old were incarcerated, compared to 3.3 percent of the native-born population.\nLooking at California prisons, immigrants are also underrepresented. U.S.-born men are incarcerated in the state at a rate of more than two-and-a-half times greater than that of foreign-born men, according to a study by the Public Policy Institute of California.\nThe American Immigration Council also reported that 2010 Census data shows incarceration rates of young, less educated Mexican, Salvadoran and Guatemalan men \u2014 which comprise the bulk of the unauthorized population \u2014 are \"significantly lower\" than incarceration rates of native-born young men without a high-school diploma.\nSpecifically for Mexican men ages 18 to 39, the incarceration rate in 2010 was 2.8 percent, compared to 10.7 percent for native-born men in the same age group, the council\u2019s report said.\n\n"}

Two that drew attention: Life After Hate and University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill. Although both organizations proposed countering messages of extremists or jihadists, they also mentioned expertise in some specific areas.

The fully-funded pension system is also a prominent talking point for Walker in his quest for the Republican presidential nomination.\nWhere pension benefits come from\nThe Wisconsin Retirement System provides retirement, disability and death benefits not only to all state employees, but to nearly all local government employees in Wisconsin. With some $85 billion in what are known as actuarial assets, it covers more than 256,000 active public employees, including teachers and municipal employees, plus 154,000 retirees and others who are no longer active employees.\nThe funds come from three sources: employer contributions, employee contributions and investment earnings. The employer-employee split was changed dramatically by Act 10, Walker's 2011 collective bargaining reform law.\nBefore Act 10, the state, as well as the local governments participating in the state retirement system, had agreed to make almost of the contributions that employees were required to make toward their pensions. In other words, often as a result of union bargaining, the employers were making the employer contributions to the pension fund and nearly all of the employee contributions, as well.\nIn 2010, for example, state and local government employers made 99 percent of the employer-employee contributions to the system. As of 2013, the latest figures available, employers paid 57 percent and employees 43 percent.\nSo, just how healthy is the pension fund, and how does it compare?\nHow close to fully funded?\nThe state's most recent actuarial evaluation showed that as of the end of 2013, the retirement system was in balance. That is, the expected total retirement benefit obligations equalled the assets ultimately expected to be available to the system. More specifically, the Gabriel Roeder Smith & Co. firm said the pension fund was 99.96 percent funded.\n\n"}

Council members voted to raise money for the runoff pool, the Austin Fair Campaign Finance Fund, from lobbyist registration fees.\nUnder the system, mayoral candidates volunteer to spend no more than $120,000 in a general election or more than $80,000 in a runoff; for City Council candidates, the limits are $75,000 in the general election and $50,000 in a runoff. The ordinance also imposes specific limits on personal loans by candidates and contributions from political action committees and donors who live outside the city.\nIn exchange, the pot of public funding \u2014 paid for by those lobby fees, fines for campaign finance violations and donations \u2014 is to be divvied up among the candidates who agree to comply and also advance to a runoff.

Bill Clinton was named Laureate\u2019s honorary chancellor in 2010 and maintained this position until 2015. His role chiefly consisted of advising the company on educational matters and traveling to campuses across the world to speak to young people.\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to our requests for clarification, but his argument seems to be based off of claims made in Peter Schweizer\u2019s book Clinton Cash. In the book, Schweizer describes what he calls the \"Clinton blur\" between the activities of Bill and Hillary Clinton, the State Department and associated nonprofits and corporations.\nWe decided to investigate Trump\u2019s claim that Hillary Clinton, who was secretary from 2009 through early 2013, \"laundered\" money to Laureate to pay off her husband\u2019s salary. We ultimately found that there is zero evidence that Laureate received any money from the federal government while Clinton was at the State Department.\nBill Clinton and Laureate Education\nNeither\u00a0Bill Clinton nor Laureate Education disclosed his compensation as honorary chancellor. However, his tax returns show that Laureate paid him approximately $16.5 million between 2010 and 2014.\nWe looked to usaspending.gov to find out if Laureate received any funding from the State Department. The site tracks the amount of money given to various organizations through government grants and contracts. According to this database, Laureate did not receive any money from any federal agency while Bill Clinton was in his role, nor while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.\nState Department Spokesperson John Kirby said in a statement, \"The State Department is not aware of any grants provided directly to Laureate Education since 2009, though we are aware of some grants to educational institutions within or affiliated with the Laureate Education network.\"\nThe International Youth Foundation\nClinton Cash draws a connection between Laureate Education and the International Youth Foundation, a nonprofit that supports youth employment, entrepreneurship and social innovation across the world. The book notes that Laureate Chairman Douglas Becker is also chairman of the foundation\u2019s board of directors.\nThe foundation\u2019s profile on usaspending.gov shows that it received approximately $72.6 million in grants between fiscal years 2009 and 2013.

Scott Walker claimed that a poll taken \"a few months ago\" showed \"70 percent approval or higher\" for Act 10, the collective bargaining reform law that spurred massive protests in Madison and an attempt to remove him from office.\nStatewide polls typically get widespread news coverage. But we don\u2019t recall any recent headlines about 70 percent support for Act 10, which sharply curbs collective bargaining for most public employees and makes the employees pay more for their pensions and health care.\nWalker's claim is important because he is counting on support for the law in his effort to win re-election in November 2014.\nSo let's see what the governor is talking about.\nAct 10\nWalker largely credits Act 10 for shoring up state and local government finances.\nThe measure has been vilified for repealing most collective bargaining for public employee unions, both at the state and local government levels.\nBut even Walker\u2019s Democratic challenger, Mary Burke, who thinks Act 10 went too far on that score, is among critics who say the law nevertheless took a necessary step in requiring most public employees to pay more for their benefits.\nWalker signed the bill two months after taking office, in March 2011. Because of reaction to it, he faced a recall election in June 2012.\nThe timing is important in assessing Walker's claim.\nIt has been more than three years since Act 10 became law and nearly two years since it was the focus of the recall.\nIn other words, it hasn't been a hot topic for pollsters for some time.

Chris Christie.\n\n\"And the #jerseycomeback keeps rolling! Thanks to @GovChristie NJ now has lowest corruption risk of any state,\" according to the March 19 tweet from the New Jersey Republican State Committee.\n\nBut PolitiFact New Jersey found that the regulations behind New Jersey\u2019s highest scores were put in place before Christie became governor. Christie, a Republican, has proposed a series of ethics reforms, but they\u2019ve been stalled by the Democrat-controlled Legislature.\n\nLet\u2019s explain the corruption risk investigation.\n\nThe State Integrity Investigation was undertaken by journalists in every state, who analyzed 330 so-called \"corruption risk indicators\" across 14 categories. The analyses focused, in part, on the existence of certain laws and their effectiveness.\n\nOn its report card, New Jersey received A grades in six categories, including State Pension Fund Management and Ethics Enforcement -- two categories where New Jersey ranked first. To analyze the Republicans\u2019 tweet, we researched the origins of regulations cited within five of those categories. No laws were cited in the sixth category.\n\nBased on our review, all of those regulations were put into effect before Christie took office.\n\nHere\u2019s a few examples:\n\nThe report card points to various regulations governing lobbying activities, which Gov. Jim McGreevey updated with a series of laws enacted in June 2004.\n\nThe New Jersey Conflicts of Interest Law, which covers various ethics rules, has been in effect since 1972. In January 2006, Gov. Richard Codey approved a bill to strengthen those regulations.\n\nCodey also signed a \"pay-to-play\" reform bill in March 2005, prohibiting state contracts of more than $17,500 for certain political donors. Gov. Jon Corzine expanded on those pay-to-play rules through an executive order in September 2008.\n\nThe report card notes how Christie issued an executive order in April 2010 to specify who must file financial disclosure statements, but previous governors have taken similar actions.\n\nThrough a spokesman, we asked journalist Colleen O\u2019Dea, an editor-at-large at NJSpotlight, who conducted the investigation in New Jersey, about whether Christie\u2019s reforms contributed to the state\u2019s score. Here\u2019s what she said:\n\n\"I really have to tell you that there have been virtually none. Christie came in and has called for numerous reforms but has put through few, if any of those things our survey asked about.\"\n\nBut Doug Mayer, spokesman for the New Jersey Republican State Committee, argued that Christie\u2019s work as U.S. Attorney in prosecuting corruption cases led to an overall change in New Jersey\u2019s political culture.\n\n\"You would be hard pressed to find anyone in New Jersey, or the entire country for that matter, who doubts Governor Christie\u2019s commitment or actual record on prosecuting political corruption. Some people don\u2019t like to admit it, but the Governor\u2019s record as a U.S. Attorney is impeccable and led directly to New Jersey\u2019s overall change in political culture,\" Mayer said in an e-mail. \"It is a fight he continues to this day with a substantial portion of his agenda dedicated to strengthening New Jersey\u2019s ethics laws.\"\n\nHowever, such prosecutions did not factor into New Jersey\u2019s score in the corruption risk investigation, according to Randy Barrett, spokesman for the Center for Public Integrity, one of the collaborators behind the project.\n\n\"We weren\u2019t looking at people, just the structures to deliver (or not) transparency and accountability,\" Barrett told us in an e-mail.\n\nOur ruling\n\nReferring to a nationwide investigation comparing states for their risk of corruption, New Jersey\u2019s Republican Party claimed in a March 19 tweet: \"Thanks to @GovChristie NJ now has lowest corruption risk of any state.\"\n\nBut the regulations behind New Jersey\u2019s highest scores were put in place before Christie became governor.

What voters are going to focus on is who's in Washington fighting and standing up for them. We're in the middle of a big battle about what this country is going to be like in terms of our priorities and our values. We just fought a Republican budget that ends Medicare as we know it.\"\n\nThe claim that Republicans want to end the government-run health insurance program for those 65 and older is being widely used by Democrats as they attack Republican proposals to cut the budget.\n\nCicilline has raised the theme repeatedly in recent new releases, YouTube videos and speeches on the floor of the House. He\u2019s also launched a series of visits to senior citizen to discuss \"the effects of the Republican budget on Medicare and Medicaid.\"\n\nPolitiFact National addressed one element of the controversy April 20 when it gave a Pants On Fire ruling to the assertion by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee that \"Seniors will have to find $12,500 for health care because Republicans voted to end Medicare.\" (Details on that ruling can be found at PolitiFact.com.)\n\nA few points are relevant to Cicilline's assertion.\n\nFirst, there is no Republican budget.\n\nAt issue is a budget resolution proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, who proposes eventually replacing Medicare with subsidies that older people would use to \"buy\" private insurance, although the elderly would never see the money -- it would be paid by the government to insurance companies.\n\nThe resolution was approved by 235 of the 240 Republicans in the House. Every Democrat, including Cicilline, voted no.\n\nIt has no chance in the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats. Such resolutions are, as PolitiFact National noted, nonbinding documents that state policy preferences and cannot be viewed as the equivalent of legislation that establishes law.\n\nSecond, the GOP proposal does not \"end Medicare as we know it.\" It wouldn't even begin to change Medicare as we know it for another 12 years.\n\nUnder the Republican plan, developed because the GOP and other critics regard the costs of the current program as unsustainable, Medicare would continue in its present form for people who already receive it. In addition, those 55 or older would be covered by the program once they hit their 65th birthday. So even 12 years from now, part of today's Medicare would remain in place until every recipient covered under the existing rules has died.\n\nThe claim would be true for younger people, because the version of Medicare they would see when they retire would be very different. For example, they would have to buy health plans from private insurance companies, with financial assistance and regulation from the government -- akin in some ways to President Obama\u2019s health-care plan that so many Republicans object to. In addition, the eligibility age would gradually rise to 67.\n\nIn short, Cicilline, has pushed back against the Republican proposal to change Medicare. But he has mischaracterized a nonbinding budget resolution as a budget. More significantly, he exaggerated the impact of a Republican Medicare proposal to imply that everyone would be affected, while the GOP resolution specifically exempts existing beneficiaries and future beneficiaries who are currently 55 and over.\n\nIf he had added those qualifiers, his statement would have been closer to accurate.

{"label": "true", "claim": "Newt Gingrich \"The right-to-work states are creating a lot more jobs today than the heavily unionized states.\"", "evidence": "Former Georgia congressman Newt Gingrich made a claim during last week\u2019s CNN debate of Republican presidential candidates that was like red meat to conservatives who complain that government is trying to force employees to join unions.\n\n\"The right-to-work states are creating a lot more jobs today than the heavily unionized states,\" said Gingrich, the former U.S. House Speaker who now lives in Virginia.\n\nIs that true? We wanted to check.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s explain what is a right-to-work state. In right-to-work states, employees can decide whether or not they want to join or financially support a union. There are 22 states, including Georgia, with right-to-work laws. Most of those states are in the South, the Plains region and parts of the West.\n\nThe right-to-work issue became a political thunderstorm earlier this year when some Republican leaders in Wisconsin wanted to strip bargaining rights from public-sector union workers and pass legislation to make it a right-to-work state. Many Republican leaders across the country complain it\u2019s more difficult for the economy to flourish in strong union states.\n\nGingrich is part of the right-to-work crowd. A campaign spokesman, R.C. Hammond, suggested we go back a decade to examine his claim. The \"historical trend is overwhelming,\" Hammond told us in an e-mail.\n\nGingrich\u2019s argument is apparently rooted in data from the National Institute for Labor Relations Research. Between 1999 to 2009, it found job growth rose in right-to-work states by 3.7 percent and fell in \"forced-unionism states\" by 2.8 percent.\n\nThe National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation conducted similar research from 2000 to 2010 in the 22 right-to-work states and found there was a less than 1 percent increase in private-sector job growth and a 5.5 percent decline in the other 28 states. Foundation official Stanley Greer stressed to us that they don\u2019t believe right-to-work guidelines are the sole factor for private-sector job growth, but still are a \"very important factor.\"\n\nThe Economic Policy Institute, an organization that says its goal is to raise the economic status of low- and middle-income Americans, argues that right-to-work laws \"have not succeeded in boosting employment growth in the states that have adopted them,\" according to a March report. Two researchers there attributed the job growth in many right-to-work states, particularly the South, to factors that include interstate road improvements and more money spent on education.\n\nAll three organizations used the federal government\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics for their research. So did we. PolitiFact Georgia compared the number of private-sector jobs in each state from April 2001 to April 2011, the most recent month available. We found 15 of the 22 right-to-work states were among the top 25 states in job growth. North Dakota, which Gingrich hailed during the CNN debate, had the largest increase during that time span, 19.5 percent. The four states with the greatest decrease were all Rust Belt states that have relied on manufacturing: Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Indiana. None of those are right-to-work states. Georgia had the fifth lowest private sector job growth rate.\n\nWe also analyzed private-sector job growth since June 2009, which federal officials said was the end of the recent economic recession. North Dakota, again, was at the head of the class and Texas, another right-to-work state, was second. Thirteen of the 22 right-to-work states were among the top 25 states in job growth. Four of the five states with the lowest private-sector job growth rates were not right-to-work states.\n\nOverall, there was a slight increase in the number of private-sector jobs in the 22 right-to-work states during the past decade and post recession. In the 28 other states, there was a small decrease in both time periods.\n\nNine of the nation\u2019s 10 fastest-growing states over the past decade were right-to-work states. Five of those states -- Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, Texas and Utah -- had increases in job growth since April 2001. The population growth in those states may be a factor.\n\nBy our analysis, Gingrich\u2019s statement that job growth is higher in right-to-work states has merit"}
{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Nathan Deal \"Roy Barnes proclaimed Mexican workers good for Georgia.\"", "evidence": "Editor's note: A response to the Oct. 1 U.S. Senate PolitiFact article can be found in Letters to the Editor\n\nWith the economy and the impact of illegal immigration on the job market on the minds of many voters this political season, Republican nominee for governor Nathan Deal recently attempted to remind Georgians that he -- not Democrat Roy Barnes -- is on their side concerning these issues.\n\nThe Deal campaign put together a 30-second ad that begins with Barnes discussing his goal of creating more jobs.\n\n\"We need to take care of our own,\" Barnes says.\n\n\"Hmm,\" a male voice says. \"Sounds nice. But Roy Barnes proclaimed Mexican workers good for Georgia.\"\n\nDeal's proof is an Atlanta Journal-Constitution article from Nov. 8, 2001. The story detailed a meeting between Barnes, who was governor at the time, and then Mexican President Vicente Fox in Mexico City. Barnes is reported as saying that Georgia's experience with a fast-growing immigrant population has generally been beneficial.\n\n\"The labor we have received, primarily Mexicans, has fueled our economy,\" Barnes said.\n\nHe added: \"We could not have had the Olympics in 1996 had it not been for that.\"\n\nThe Barnes campaign called the Deal ad a distortion of Barnes' position on immigrants legally working in the United States.\n\n\"Barnes praised 'immigration,' not illegal immigration, as having been 'beneficial' as it 'fueled our economy,' \" the Barnes campaign said in a statement. \"He urged President Bush to 'work [immigration] out' because 'governors can't control immigration policy.' \"\n\nDeal campaign spokesman Brian Robinson countered that it is disingenuous for the Barnes campaign to accuse Deal's ad of stretching the truth here. Barnes was certainly aware that most immigrant workers were not here legally, Robinson said.\n\n\"For him to imply otherwise doesn't pass the laugh test,\" Robinson said. \"What percentage of that work force meets that criteria [of being in the U.S. legally]?\"\n\nWe took a look. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimated that in 2009, there were slightly more than 28,000 people in Georgia who were legal permanent residents or \"green card\" holders. The federal agency also tries to keep track of how many people are living illegally in the U.S. About 480,000 illegal immigrants were living in Georgia in 2009, according to Homeland Security estimates, and in 2000 the estimated total was 220,000. The Homeland Security report does not have a breakdown of what percentage of people living in Georgia illegally are from Mexico. Nationwide, Homeland Security estimates that 62 percent of illegal immigrants in the U.S. are from Mexico. Applied to Georgia in 2000, that would be 136,400 illegal immigrants from Mexico. Presumably a large number of those were workers.\n\nBarnes was in Mexico in 2001 for a four-day trade mission. Mexico was Georgia's third-largest trading partner, and Georgia companies were exporting $1 billion in products to that nation. State officials estimated at the time that Latino-owned businesses in Georgia had about $1.3 billion a year in annual sales. Some of Georgia's business titans, such as Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines, came on the trip.\n\nBarnes told a story in the 2001 AJC article about farmers in South Georgia, where he said \"it's about as conservative as you can get,\" who wanted him to get health coverage for \"migrant farmworkers.\" The governor noted the presidents of the United States and Mexico were discussing proposals for legalizing some undocumented Mexican workers.\n\n\"Old ideas have changed,\" Barnes said.\n\nBut since then attitudes toward illegal immigration have hardened, as highlighted by a poll that found 68 percent of Georgians support Arizona-type restrictions and enforcement of illegal immigration laws. And many politicians do not want to appear soft on the issue.\n\nBarnes said during a July debate that he would support an Arizona-type law in the Peach State to fight illegal immigration. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed a law that has since gone before the courts that allows state and local law enforcement officers to ask people stopped for possible crimes to show proof they are in the United States legally.\n\nDeal's first television ad, in July, slammed President Barack Obama over illegal immigration, promised Georgia would soon have an Arizona-type law and said he doesn't care what \"liberals\" think. Robinson accused Barnes of running from his \"liberal record\" with his support of the Arizona legislation. \"He is all over the board on this,\" Robinson said.\n\nAndra Gillespie, an assistant political science professor at Emory University, explained that Barnes is trying to cut into Deal's conservative base by taking a stand on illegal immigration that is seemingly popular with most Georgia voters. Gillespie said the Deal statement that Barnes \"proclaimed Mexican workers good for Georgia\" is misleading.\n\n\"Nathan Deal's campaign knows very well that when Roy Barnes went to Mexico and praised the contributions of Mexican immigrants [presumably in a spirit of good will and diplomacy], he was not explicitly supporting illegal immigration,\" the professor said. \"But because Barnes did not specify his support for legal immigrant workers, the Deal campaign is taking advantage of the ambiguity and trying to fill in the blanks for voters.\"\n\n"}

{"label": "false", "claim": "Sherrod Brown There is a Republican \"plan to end Medicare.\"", "evidence": "Some claims are so popular that no matter how often they get debunked, politicians or their campaigns can\u2019t stop using them. A current favorite: Republicans plan to end Medicare.\n\nU.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown\u2019s re-election organization, Friends of Sherrod Brown, is the latest group to utter this claim. In a fund-raising solicitation sent by e-mail June 20 on behalf of Brown, Sarah Benzing, campaign manager for the Ohio Democrat, said exactly that: there is a Republican \"plan to end Medicare.\"\n\nIn fairness, this was but one small part of her e-mail to potential donors.\n\nBenzing spent far more time criticizing Josh Mandel, the Ohio treasurer who has filed candidacy papers to run against Brown. She noted that Mandel, a Republican, recently had a private fund-raising reception with Washington lobbyists. Mandel avoided talking with the press on this trip, as he has on other occasions, and this was the gist of Benzing\u2019s fund-raising e-mail.\n\nWriting in a guy-walks-into-a-bar style, she began her pitch: \"A guy walks into a DC lobbying firm... While he\u2019s in town, he stands up an Ohio reporter and continues to refuse to discuss his position on the Republican plan to end Medicare or allegations that he used taxpayer money to campaign.\" By the end of her e-mail, she said, \"Ohioans won\u2019t stand for his stonewalling, and when he tries to drown out their concerns with attacks bought and paid for by these shadowy operatives and DC lobbyists, we\u2019ll be ready to respond.\" She asked for \"$5 or more to help us fight back against Josh Mandel\u2019s corporate lobbyist friends.\"\n\nPerhaps we should be flattered that Benzing based much of her e-mail on our reporting about Mandel. The Plain Dealer provided details of Mandel\u2019s Washington trip in its political blog on Cleveland.com, and Benzing repeated them and credited the newspaper. The Plain Dealer also operates PolitiFact Ohio, and in the interest of full disclosure, the reporter writing this very PolitiFact item is the same reporter who wrote the Cleveland.com piece on Mandel. We\u2019re just calling \u2018em as we see \u2018em.\n\nAnd we see a problem with the Brown campaign\u2019s claim, because Republicans have not said they want to end Medicare. PolitiFact has noted this several times, and many political operatives are aware of the issue and its broader debate.\n\nAbout that debate: House Republicans and many in the Senate support a proposal by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin to convert Medicare into a \"premium-support payment\" program starting in 2022. In other words, people retiring then would sign up for private health insurance plans, with Medicare paying those plans to provide coverage.\nThere would be a middle man rather than direct payment from the government to the doctor, as Medicare is currently structured.\n\nProponents and critics disagree as to whether a voucher system would be good or bad and about the perils of doing nothing. The Congressional Budget Office says the Ryan plan would end up costing seniors more out-of-pocket for health care than they pay now. But we are dealing here with the more basic issue of Benzing\u2019s claim: that Republicans plan to end Medicare.\n\nIf you are 55 years or older already, it would not change. And if you are younger, the Ryan plan would leave you with a different Medicare system, but one in which the government still played a big role in your health coverage.\n\nThis has been rehashed repeatedly.\n\nFrom our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin on June 10: \"Moreover, we\u2019ve established that, although it\u2019s expected that senior citizens would pay more for health care under Ryan\u2019s plan, they would still have health care.\"\n\nFrom PolitiFact Virginia on June 9: \"Would the plan really end Medicare? The Republican plan would be a huge change to the current program, and future seniors would have to pay more for their health plans if it becomes law. But to say it would end Medicare, as the DCCC e-mail does, is a major exaggeration. All seniors -- current and future -- would continue to be offered coverage under the proposal, and the program\u2019s budget would increase every year.\"\n\nFrom the national PolitiFact on May 25: \"Seniors would continue to be offered coverage under the proposal, and the program\u2019s budget would increase every year although at a rate not expected to match the rise in medical costs. The government would still play a critical role in directing the program and setting standards.\"\n\nFrom PolitiFact Wisconsin on April 11: \"To be sure, the plan would change Medicare, significantly, starting in 2022. But for those who turn 65 before then, there would be no changes at all, even after 2022. And for the others, Medicare would change -- dramatically -- but it would still exist.\"\n\nWhy, then, did the Brown campaign say that the Republican plan would end Medicare? Benzing sent us three sources for the statement. The first was a Wall Street Journal article on April 4 that, according to Benzing, said the Ryan plan \"would essentially end Medicare.\" The Journal article, however, didn\u2019t quite say that.\n\nIt said: \"The plan would essentially end Medicare, which now pays most of the health-care bills for 48 million elderly and disabled Americans, as a program that directly pays those bills.\"\n\nChanging the payment method is not the same as ending the entire program.\n\nHer next source was a Kaiser Health News article from April 4 that said, \"A premium support model would fundamentally change the way that Medicare works by limiting the amount of money the federal government spends on medical services for seniors and the disabled. Currently, Medicare is an entitlement program, which means that the government must help finance every doctor visit and medical service that an individual needs.\"\n\nThere\u2019s little question about a fundamental change -- but that, too, is not the same as killing Medicare, especially since the program would remain unchanged for people who retire before 2022.\n\nFinally, she listed a Kaiser Health News article from April 5 that said seniors would pay sharply more for their Medicare coverage under Ryan\u2019s plan. It provided estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. \"For example, by 2030, under the plan, typical 65 year olds would be required to pay 68 percent of the total cost of their coverage, which includes premiums, deductibles, and other out-of-pocket costs, according to CBO. \u00a0That compares with the 25 percent they would pay under current law, CBO said.\"\n\nBenzing cited the article accurately. It should be mentioned, however, that Medicare trustees don\u2019t see the current rate, generous though it may be, as sustainable past 2024. Some other form of savings, cost sharing or revenue-raising methods may be inevitable.\n\n\"Ask anyone who will pay twice as much out-of-pocket under the Republican plan if it's still Medicare,\" Benzing told us when we asked about the plan-to-end-Medicare claim. \"Ask anyone who thought they were going to have guaranteed coverage and now won't if it's still Medicare.\"\n\nThose are questions of degree. Change of some kind is likely -- so will that mean death to Medicare?\n\nCertainly not for millions of current retirees and baby boomers now over age 55. For everyone else, the Ryan plan might better be defined by using another political chestnut, namely, the end of \"Medicare as we know it\" -- a cliche, perhaps, but one with enough qualification to keep the claim out of the hot seat.\n\nThe Brown fund-raising pitch had no such qualification. No matter how often it's said, this still remains true - that the unqualified end-of-Medicare statement is not accurate"}

Guns will be plentiful but ammo will be another story. How does $3.75 a round (that's for one bullet) for a 9mm work for you? \u00a0Box of 50 would only cost you $187.50.\"\nWe wondered: Is the email correct to say that all lead for bullets will now have to come from overseas?\nThe Doe Run plant\nWe\u2019ve been down this road before.\nIn December, former Republican U.S. Rep. Allen West of South Florida, stated on his website: \"It seems that back door gun control is in full effect in the United States. Why? Thanks to Obama\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), we can no longer smelt lead from ore in the United States. ... So America, back door gun control is moving forward and while we are all distracted with Obamacare and Iran nuclear negotiations, our Second Amendment rights are undergoing an assault by clandestine infiltration.\"\nWe rated West\u2019s claim Pants on Fire.\nThe shuttered smelter, operated by Doe Run, is located in Herculaneum, Mo. Facing regulatory concerns about its air-quality record, Doe Run announced in 2010 that it had reached a settlement with the EPA and the state of Missouri which included paying fines. Then, in December 2013, it shut down. We found no evidence that the EPA\u2019s settlement had anything to do with gun control -- it was about pollution.\nEver since the EPA was created in 1970, one of its missions has been to limit pollution from smelters, which are \"terribly toxic sites,\" said David Rosner, a professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University who studies the politics of pollution, told us when we wrote fact-checked West. Lead can accumulate in the body from many sources, and it can severely hamper mental and physical development.\n\"It had nothing to do with gun control or bullets,\" Rosner told PolitiFact. \"The idea of linking this to an issue of gun control or a surreptitious way for the government trying to shut down the gun industry is nuts. This was an EPA decision because of children who were being poisoned by what had come out of that plant.\"\nIndeed, while the chain email blames Obama, the EPA\u2019s case against Doe Run actually began decades ago. The St. Louis area failed to meet federal clean air standards for lead in 1987 due to emissions from the smelter, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported in 1989. That was during the Reagan administration.\nReagan wasn't the only Republican president who presided over an advance in the national anti-lead effort. In 2008, during the tenure of President George W. Bush, the EPA adopted tougher air quality standards for lead that were 10 times more stringent than the past.\nDoe Run\u2019s primary smelter -- a plant that extracts lead from ore -- was the last primary smelter in the country. But Doe Run continues to operate as a secondary lead smelter -- essentially a recycler for lead contained in other products. That includes -- you guessed it -- bullets.\n\n"}

Trump began his Nov. 14, 2015, speech at Beaumont\u2019s Ford Park Arena by calling the events in Paris the night before \"terrible.\"\nHe went on to say, \"And when you look at what happened in that case, it\u2019s just reported, one from Syria. And our president wants to take in 250,000 from Syria,\" citing one of the Paris attacker\u2019s alleged Syrian nationality.\nWhile the Syrian passport allegedly found next to the body of one of the attackers is believed to be fake and at least six out of the 10 known assailants are European nationals, Trump and others cited the Paris attacks as good reason to prohibit additional Syrian refugees from entering the United States.\nTrump was not alone in claiming President Barack Obama wants to allow hundreds of thousands of Syrians entry to the United States. Republican presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina put the number at 100,000 Syrian refugees and Ben Carson likened bringing 200,000 people \"from that region\" to malpractice. Trump had used the 250,000 figure before, telling Matt Lauer of NBC News he didn\u2019t want that many Syrians coming to the United States.\nThe United States has a long history of taking in refugees from war-torn countries, including some from Syria. But has President Obama decided to admit 250,000 Syrian refugees?\nOur attempts to learn the basis for Trump\u2019s statement yielded no replies from his campaign.\nIn October 2015, Fox News commentator Sean Hannity made a claim much like the one Trump offered in Beaumont, though Hannity mentioned another country as well, saying: \"The president said he\u2019s going to bring in 250,000 (Syrian and Iraqi) refugees into this country.\"\nPants on Fire, PolitiFact ruled a week later, finding that Hannity lofted a figure not rooted in Obama administration plans, though there are plans to admit more refugees, including more Syrians, over several years.\nHannity offered as backup for his claim a Sept. 20, 2015, Associated Press news story stating that the U.S. will accept 85,000 refugees from around the world next year, up from 70,000, and that total would rise to 100,000 in 2017, per Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s remarks. Hannity added up the total number of refugees allowed each year from all over the world, to get a total of 255,000 refugees.\nThat AP story, however, said that those figures reflected refugees to be welcomed from around the world, not just Syria or even the Middle East. On Sept. 10, 2015, the Obama administration announced plans to increase the number of Syrian refugees to at least 10,000, although talk radio hosts such as Rush Limbaugh have claimed figures almost 10 times as high. We reached out to the White House for clarity.\nWhite House spokesman Eric Schultz sent back an email stating that the U.S. is increasing the \"number of Syrian and other refugees we admit from around the world on an annual basis,\" going up to 85,000 next year and 100,000 the following year.\nWhile Hannity further clarified his statement, that he didn\u2019t say all would be Syrian refugees, Trump explicitly labeled all 250,000 as Syrian refugees.\nAfter searching other news stories, checking with the White House and searching some more, we did find that 250,000 figure out there on the Internet -- on a parody site called \u00a0Real News Right Now, which stated: \"The U.S. Department of State announced today that it will grant upwards of two-hundred and fifty thousand Syrian refugees temporary amnesty in the United States. Over the next four months, State Department officials working in conjunction with FEMA will begin processing and transporting the refugees to sparsely populated parts of Arizona and North Dakota.\" It went on to quote Cathy Pieper, a spokesperson for the \"Department of State,\" the article said. We called the State Department to see if there was a spokesperson by that name; there isn\u2019t.\nRefugee resettlement\nIn September 2015, Secretary of State John Kerry shared the Obama administration\u2019s plans to increase the total number of refugees coming into the United States from all countries from 70,000 to 85,000 in Fiscal Year 2016, with \"10,000 over the next year from Syria specifically,\" Kerry said. The following year, Kerry said the target would be closer to 100,000 total, again from all countries.\nBetween Oct. 1, 2011 and Nov. 20, 2015, the U.S. resettled 2,261 Syrian refugees in 36 states, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank that analyzes migration across the world. Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokesperson for the organization, wrote in an email that between the Obama administration\u2019s announcement of accepting 10,000 Syrian refugees in Fiscal Year 2016 (part of the total increase to 85,000 refugees) and the plan to raise the overall refugee admissions ceiling in FY 2017 to 100,000, even if the entirety of the increase between Fiscal Years 2016 and 2017 were all Syrian refugees (the allotted number for Syrian refugees hasn\u2019t been specified), that would permit admission of 25,000 Syrian refugees in FY 2017.\n\"We know of no proposal by the administration to admit 250,000 Syrian refugees,\" she said.\nAccording to a report submitted to Congress Oct. 1, 2015, the U.S. admitted between 1,600 and 1,800 Syrian refugees in FY 2015.

King Says Rick Perry \"proposed a binational health insurance program with Mexico.\"", "evidence": "The term \"Obamacare\" is used by critics to describe the health care overhaul that President Barack Obama signed into law last year.\n\nAnd some conservatives derisively use the phrase \"Romneycare\" to slight Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and the changes he approved to Massachusetts\u2019 health care system when he was governor there.\n\nHow about \"Perrycare\"? That\u2019s Georgia anti-illegal immigration activist D.A. King\u2019s term for what he contends was an effort by Texas governor and Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry to impose a binational health care plan between his state and Mexico. King even has a website dedicated to highlight Perry\u2019s stance on immigration issues.\n\nKing is one of the most vocal voices in Georgia\u2019s ongoing debate over illegal immigration.\n\n\"Granting instate tuition to illegals is only a small part of Perry\u2019s problematic record,\" King, president of the Dustin Inman Society, which is opposed to open borders between the U.S. and Mexico, wrote in a recent op-ed to the Marietta Daily Journal. \"We noted that Perry had dismissed any consideration of a state immigration enforcement law such as Arizona, Georgia and other states struggled to put in place; had proposed a binational health insurance program with Mexico (Perrycare?); has expressed his support for legalizing the fugitive illegals who have escaped capture at American borders (it\u2019s not amnesty, it\u2019s a guest worker plan!); and refused to use the power of his office for any E-Verify legislation in Texas. So what if that state has one of the highest number of illegals in the country?\"\n\nKing made a number of points, but we decided to look at the Perrycare charge because the presidential candidate\u2019s immigration policy has come up in a number of other forums.\n\nSome Perry critics describe him as being soft on illegal immigration because of his position on allowing students who are illegal immigrants to pay instate tuition at colleges in Texas. The criticism has hurt Perry\u2019s standing among some Republicans. So we wondered if King had found another case in which Perry could be criticized as soft on illegal immigrants.\n\nOur colleagues at PolitiFact Texas recently examined this issue when another GOP presidential candidate, Rick Santorum, a former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, said Perry supported binational health insurance. Santorum\u2019s claim was rated Half True.\n\nKing dismissed the PolitiFact Texas ruling, forwarding us an e-mail with a widely circulated speech by Perry on the issue. The Texas governor urged lawmakers there to pass a telemedicine program that allows \"individuals living on the Mexican side of the border\" to get care from a specialist hundreds of miles away. Telemedicine is using forms of communication such as video conferences to provide health care, according to the American Telemedicine Association.\n\nPerry also mentioned a study to look at the feasibility of binational insurance.\n\n\"This study recognizes that the Mexican and U.S. sides of the border compose one region, and we must address health care problems throughout that region,\" Perry said.\n\nThose comments were made in August 2001, two weeks before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nThe study guidelines were outlined in House Bill 2498, passed by the Texas Legislature in 2001. It begins by stating the interest of the state to deliver affordable health care services to citizens \"on both sides of the Texas-Mexico border.\"\n\nThe 141-page report, released in 2003, found some legal problems with the idea and logistical challenges, such as there are no laws in Mexico preventing a doctor from performing the duties of a specialist. The report found other problems. Some Texas health care providers were concerned that medical care in Mexico did not meet their standards, the medical equipment in Mexico was not as advanced and some medicine approved in Mexico may not meet Food and Drug Administration guidelines.\n\nThe report offered several options if Texas wanted to move forward with the idea. Perry and state lawmakers didn\u2019t act. A spokeswoman for Perry noted to PolitiFact Texas that the Legislature took no further action on the topic.\n\nStill, some websites have bashed conservative media for not being more critical of Perry.\n\"However, in spite of the Legislature\u2019s failure to act, Perry made clear his willingness to funnel Texas\u2019s assets to Mexico,\" an item in the New American website said. It then had excerpts from Perry\u2019s August 2001 speech. The website failed to note that the speech was made two years before the study.\n\nBy signing the bill that allowed the study, and through his 2001 speech, we can see how some find seeds for Perry\u2019s support of a binational health insurance program with Mexico. But the governor never acted on the study, and he hasn\u2019t appeared to talk much about the subject since 2001.\n\nStill, Perry pushed for the study, which implies his interest in the idea"}

I think we can do better than that.\" That prompted Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, a Democrat, to come to the microphone and call it a breach of the traditional bipartisan decorum for such events.\nJindal, a potential Republican presidential candidate, hit the airwaves again two days later when he was interviewed on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe.\nPanelist Mike Barnicle asked Jindal to defend his own economic record: \"The last time the Census Bureau checked the per capita income of Louisiana, you were 47th lowest in the United States, not all under your watch. What have you done, as governor, to bring in all these better paying jobs and boost your people's per capita income?\"\nJindal responded, \"Well, the great thing is, we're doing exactly what the president has not. Cut taxes, reform debt, make some investment in workforce training, make it easier for businesses to create jobs. And here's the record. In Louisiana, we now have more people working, highest incomes in our state's history. Larger population than ever before. And the president can't say all those things about the country. Our economy has grown 50 percent faster than the national GDP, even since the national recession.\"\nWe wondered whether it\u2019s correct that Louisiana has \"grown 50 percent faster than the national GDP, even since the national recession.\"\nWhen we asked Jindal\u2019s office for more detail, they said he had been comparing the growth in inflation-adjusted gross domestic product for his state and the nation since 2007 -- a year he chose because it was the \"baseline\" year before he began his first term as governor.\nWe looked at the numbers and found that Jindal actually understated the comparison. Between 2007 and 2012 (the last year for which data is available), inflation-adjusted GDP grew by 2.5 percent nationally, but by 6.4 percent in Louisiana.\nThis definitely supports Jindal\u2019s claim. However, we\u2019ll note a caveat: While the timespan Jindal used certainly makes sense given his tenure as governor, it\u2019s not the only way to define \"since the national recession\" -- the words he used in the MSNBC interview.\nThe recession officially began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009. So if you want to look at the period \"since the recession,\" one could just as easily use the range 2008-12, 2009-12 or 2010-12. So let\u2019s look at how these date ranges stack up.\nFor 2008-12, Jindal would also be correct. During that period, Louisiana growth (7.9 percent) easily outpaced United States growth (3.2 percent).\nBut he\u2019d be wrong for 2009-12, when United States growth (6.7 percent) exceeded Louisiana growth (4.6 percent).\nAnd he\u2019d also be wrong for 2010-12, when the United States economy grew (4.1 percent) and the Louisiana economy actually shrank (by 1.2 percent).\nUnited States growth also exceeded Louisiana growth between 2011 and 2012 -- 2.5 percent to 1.5 percent.\nPerhaps an easier way to look at it is to compare the year-over-year growth in GDP for Louisiana and the United States.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nIt is true that, at one time, Nike paid factory workers close to 20 cents per hour and that many worked over 10 hours a day, six days a week. While most of these numbers are now outdated, experts tell us that overseas factory workers for Nike (and most other major garment industry bands) continue to work long hours for low wages.\nLet\u2019s take a look.\nInvestigations into Nike\u2019s Vietnamese factories in the 1990s\nIn October 1996, CBS\u2019 48 Hours news program aired an investigative report on the conditions of Nike factories in Vietnam. The segment revealed that factory workers, mostly women, worked \"six days a week for only $40 a month,\" which translated to about 20 cents an hour.\nAn investigation by Dara O\u2019Rourke, a researcher with the Transnational Resource and Action Center, followed in 1997 and reported several labor law violations at the Vietnamese Tae Kwang Vina plant, a factory that employed over 9,000 workers who produced 400,000 pairs of shoes a month for Nike. According to the investigation, the plant\u2019s night-shift employees worked an average of 10.5 hours a day, six days per week at a monthly salary of $40.\nA 2003 World Bank report said Nike violated Vietnamese environmental and labor laws by exposing 10,000 workers at the Tae Kwang Vina plant to toxic solvents and forcing them to work above legal overtime limits. The report noted that the investigations, along with public outcry evoked by activists in Vietnam and the United States, prompted Nike to make improvements:\n\"Consequently, Nike took proactive measures and allowed independent auditing of the sweatshops. In 1999, Nike implemented its own \u2018Code of Conduct\u2019 in Vietnamese factories.

Responding to Wisconsin Eye TV host Steven Walters, Hintz said an alternative would have to be developed first. Then he made a statement that seemed to indict the facility, saying:\nWe have a 66 percent recidivism rate for the kids there, in the three years after they get out. States like Missouri, that have more of a regional model -- 8 percent.\"\nSo, 66 percent of Lincoln Hills inmates commit new offenses within three years of being released?\nAnd that\u2019s eight times higher than in states such as Missouri, which has been held up as a potential model for Wisconsin?\nWe\u2019ll see that, as national experts have stated, comparing states on juvenile recidivism is not easily done.\nThe trouble at Lincoln Hills\nLincoln Hills generally holds inmates as young as 13 and as old as 25, with most inmates in their mid-to late-teens; some adults are being held for crimes they committed as juveniles. Incarcerating an inmate there costs more than $100,000 a year.\nGroups such as Youth Justice Milwaukee, which is calling for Wisconsin\u2019s youth prisons to be closed, argue that conditions at Lincoln Hills can lead to higher recidivism -- inmates committing new offenses after they\u2019re released. Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele has gone even further than Hintz, saying 75 percent of Lincoln Hills inmates fall back into criminal activity.\nMeanwhile, Missouri -- when facing problems similar to those at Lincoln Hills, such as fights between inmates, long stints in solitary confinement and injuries inflicted by guards -- replaced large institutions with small facilities, closer to young offenders' homes.\nBut the contrast in recidivism between the two states is not how Hintz portrays it.\nHintz\u2019s partially accurate evidence\nTo back Hintz\u2019s claim, his office cited a January 2017 report by the nonpartisan Wisconsin \u00a0Legislative Fiscal Bureau. It says that according to the latest available data, Lincoln Hills has a three-year recidivism rate of 63 percent. That is, 278 juveniles were released from Lincoln Hills in 2011 and 63 percent returned to either a juvenile correctional facility or an adult prison, or were placed on probation for a new offense, by 2014.\nSo, Hintz\u2019s claim of a 66 percent recidivism rate at Lincoln Hills is high by only three percentage points.\nMissouri\u2019s definition of recidivism is roughly similar to Wisconsin\u2019s, but has four parts. It includes youths who are sent back to the juvenile system, are sent to adult prison, are put on probation, or are put into a 120-day program.\nBut the latest State of Missouri figures show Missouri\u2019s three-year recidivism rate, for 2013 to 2016, is 30 percent. That\u2019s far less than Lincoln Hills\u2019 63 percent. But it\u2019s also much higher than the 8 percent Hintz claimed.\nThat lower rate applies only to the first part of Missouri\u2019s recidivism definition -- youths who commit new offenses and are sent back to the youth system.\n\n"}

In the years from 2009 to 2012, Saez found that the income flowing to families in the top 1 percent of \u00a0families went up by over 30 percent, while for the rest, income grew by less than half a percent. \u00a0\n\"Hence, the top 1 percent captured 95 percent of the income gains in the first three years of the recovery,\" Saez wrote.\nThe main caveat with Saez\u2019s work is that he used preliminary data for 2012 and didn\u2019t include two significant kinds of income -- money from the government (Social Security, welfare, food stamps, etc) or \u00a0the value of health insurance benefits.

We asked Davis how she reached her conclusion, and learned that she was referring to 2011 budget cuts to the Texas Department of State Health Services\u2019 family planning program.\n\nSpokesman Anthony Spangler emailed us a collection of links to news stories as well as letters, memos and Davis\u2019 written responses.\n\nAccording to the program\u2019s website, the services it provides include a health check and follow-ups on health problems as well as contraception, counseling and tests for cervical cancer, sexually transmitted diseases, HIV and diabetes.\n\nDepartment spokeswoman Carrie Williams told us by email that clients must fall under 250 percent of the federal poverty level to receive help through the program. By 2012 guidelines, that would translate to an annual income of $57,625 for a family of four.\n\u00a0\n\nHow many affected?\n\nThe funding cuts, according to an April 24, 2011, Associated Press news article and a May 24, 2011, news article in the Austin American-Statesman, emerged in April 2011 when some of the Republican-led House's most conservative lawmakers pushed a series of floor amendments, shifting money from family planning services to programs for poor and disabled children, anti-abortion-rights programs and crisis pregnancy centers.\n\nSpangler sent us a May 5, 2011, memo from the Legislative Budget Board estimating that 283,909 women would lose basic health care in the 2012-13 biennium if the program got $37.9 million from the state instead of $99.6 million listed in the first version of the budget taken up by lawmakers. The board has not made a more recent estimate, spokesman John Barton told us by phone.\n\nState Health Services bases its calculation on slightly different figures. Williams told us that because the family planning program\u2019s 2010-11 budget was $111.5 million, the Legislature\u2019s approval of $37.9 million for 2012-13 was a decrease of $73.6 million. Williams said that dividing that number by $205 -- the average cost per client -- and taking into account that 95 percent of clients are women, the department estimates the program would serve 160,000 to 180,000 fewer women per year.\n\nThe full effect of the cuts won\u2019t be felt until next year, Williams said, because the department was allowed to carry over $5 million from the 2011 budget to ease the transition. Precise data were not immediately available, but the one-time money helped provide services to \"thousands\" of women, she said. Going by the $205-per-client cost, it appears the number could be up to 23,000.\n\nSpangler also sent us a March 8, 2012 report from the left-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities that put the per-year number at 150,000. Anne Dunkelberg, associate director of the center, said her group used budget board numbers from the 2012-13 state appropriations act and State Health Services\u2019 2012 operating budget.\n\nIn sum: Assorted estimates say between 137,000 and 180,000 women are losing State Health Services family planning in 2012.

And, to hear her tell it, there isn\u2019t enough dough around to support it.\n\n\nAyotte, New Hampshire\u2019s junior senator, voted against the bill last month, citing the amount of non-emergency funding included in the proposal for other projects.\n\n\"When total Sandy spending is added up, it's more than the annual budget for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. And it's more than twice the annual budget of the U.S. Energy Department,\" Ayotte wrote Wednesday in an opinion piece, explaining her vote in a piece titled \"Sandy Relief Bill Became an Excuse for Spending Spree.\"\n\n\"Without question we should help Hurricane Sandy victims with emergency relief legislation,\" she wrote. \"But the days of using a crisis to pass bloated bills stuffed with non-emergency spending further burying us in debt must end.\"\n\nThroughout her column, Ayotte targeted the Sandy relief bill for including billions in non-emergency spending, like $2 million for roof repairs at the Smithsonian in Washington, $4 million for the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, $50 million for the National Park Service and $16 billion that can be used in 47 states for past and future events from 2011 through 2013.\n\nBut, for this analysis, we\u2019re going to focus on the total Sandy spending that Ayotte cited.\n\nAyotte pegged total Sandy spending at roughly $60 billion, which includes the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act\u00a0and H.R. 41, a bill that passed Congress earlier in the month.\n\nThe Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, which passed the House and the Senate in January on the way to the president\u2019s desk, contains two levels of funding. \u00a0One level, known as \"outlays,\" is expected to reach $49.2 billion between 2013-2021, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office. The other is \"budget authority,\" the total spending allowed by Congress, which would cap at $50.5 billion during that time, according to the CBO.\n\nMeanwhile, H.R. 41\u00a0added $9.7 billion to the national flood insurance fund. Combined, this sets the total Sandy spending between $58.9 and $60.2 billion. So, Ayotte\u2019s total figure is accurate.\n\nNow, let\u2019s compare those totals to the Homeland Security and Energy budgets.\n\nThe Homeland Security budget can be looked at three ways:\n\n$60.4 billion in outlays in Fiscal Year 2012, (White House records)\n$47.7 billion in budget authority for FY 2012 (White House)\n$47.4 billion in actual spending for FY 2012 (Treasury records)\n\nTo review, Ayotte claimed the $60.2 billion in Sandy Relief was more than the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s annual budget.\n\nBy two measures she\u2019s right and by the third, she\u2019s very, very close. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAyotte\u2019s office said she was referring to the federal budget authority figures when she made the statement. Those typically reflect the total amount that can be spent in a given year.\n\nBut several economists, considered both liberal and conservative, suggested that outlays, which can sometimes be higher than budget authority figures, are the better measure because they show how much actually will be spent in a given year.\n\n\"In general, outlays are a better measure because they tell you how much the Congressional Budget Office (the official scorekeeper for Congress) says will actually go out the door in a given year,\" Ron Haskins, a senior economic fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote in an email to The Telegraph.\n\nNow, moving on to the energy department, which has a similar budget breakdown.\n\n$39 billion in outlays for Fiscal Year 2012 (White House)\n$22.8 billion in budget authority for FY 2012 (White House)\n$32.5 billion in actual spending for FY 2012 (Treasury)\n\nAyotte said Sandy relief spending was more than twice the energy department\u2019s budget. When the department\u2019s figures are multiplied by two, she\u2019s correct only when looking at the budget authority figure.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Ayotte chose to compare Sandy relief spending, which will be spread over the next eight years, to the annual department budgets, which reflect only one year of spending.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOur ruling:\n\n\u00a0\n\n"}

Johnson, a Democrat, had offered his support for legislation to end a federal loophole that does not require manufacturers to label fur and fake fur garments that cost less than $150.\n\n\"Exporters use this loophole to deceptively sell products made from cat and dog fur as though they were made from faux fur or the fur of other animals,\" Johnson wrote in comments submitted for the Congressional Record.\n\nThe congressman added that it is illegal to import, export, sell or advertise domestic dog fur in this country.

About one in eight fur garments falls below the labeling standard, said U.S. Rep Jim Moran (D-Va.). The Humane Society recently tested 38 fur-trimmed jackets. Three had fur from domestic dogs, Markarian said. Some were from raccoon dogs, a canine species specific to Asia, the Humane Society official said. Those canines, Markarian said, are often skinned alive.\n\n\"We really feel that this is still a problem and consumers need to have more confidence in what they're buying,\" Markarian said.\n\nMarkarian said legislation is needed because more fur-rimmed jackets are being sold here and advertised as faux fur. It's not, he said.\n\nThe Humane Society reached out-of-court settlements in March with Lord & Taylor, Macy's, Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue to stop advertising garments as faux fur that are trimmed with coyote or dog pelts. The settlements came after a District of Columbia judge in February fined Neiman Marcus $25,000 for advertising items as faux that were actually trimmed with raccoon dog, the St. Petersburg Times reported.\n\nInvestigators for an animal rights group, meanwhile, recorded footage of what is said to be a raccoon dog being skinned alive in China as part of the fur trade.\n\nChinese officials have vowed to stop the trade of cat and dog fur, calling it \"illegal and barbaric,\" according to news reports. The Chinese State Forestry Administration pledged in 2005 to strengthen animal welfare regulations on animals farmed for fur.\n\nCongress passed legislation in 2000 that prohibits importing or exporting dog and cat fur. But animal rights activists say some manufacturers are still finding ways around the law.\n\nMoran, the congressman from Virginia, is the lead sponsor of legislation that would remove the loophole, which was created in 1951.\n\nThe resolution unanimously passed the House of Representatives on July 28.

Far too often, we require talented persons from other countries who are trained in U.S. universities to return home, rather than stay in here and continue to contribute to our economy.

{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Jimmy Carter Said that his batting average with Congress is higher than every other president since Dwight D. Eisenhower except Lyndon Johnson.", "evidence": "Thirty years since losing the White House after a single term, Jimmy Carter is at ease with his presidential legacy.\n\nIn his recent book \"White House Diary,\" Carter released excerpts from a journal he kept as president. In its afterword, he acknowledged it may be his last chance to comment on the work he and his team carried out, and he is \"proud of what we accomplished.\"\n\nThis pride extends to what he described as a winning record with the U.S. Congress, according to his Sept. 20 interview with NBC anchor Brian Williams.\n\n\"And as you probably know, I had the highest batting average with Congress than any president in modern days except Lyndon Johnson,\" Carter said. \"Better than John Kennedy, better than anybody else. Despite the fact that we had some highly controversial things. So I had a very successful term.\"\n\nThe Carter Center uses his success rating (batting average) from Congressional Quarterly, a leading authority on Congress. They calculate percentage of votes that go a president's way during his term. It's also based on a University of Virginia essay on his presidency.\n\nBut wasn't Carter famously at odds with Congress? How could he possibly have been \"successful\"?\n\nWe looked at Carter's \"White House Diary,\" where he elaborated more carefully on his track record in commentary accompanying Carter's April 19, 1977, entry:\n\n\"Despite the controversial and often unpopular nature of my proposals to the Congress, I had remarkably good success in congressional approval of bills I supported. The Congressional Quarterly reported that since 1953 Lyndon Johnson, John Kennedy and I ranked in that order in obtaining approval of legislation proposed to Congress. The Miller Center reported that my record exceeded Kennedy's.\"\n\nCQ Almanac publishes vote studies each year that determine how often the president took a clear position on a vote in Congress, and how often they went his way.\n\nThe almanac lists success rates by term of Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower through George W. Bush. If you average those rates for each president, Carter is third. He got his way 76.6 percent of the time. That's right behind Kennedy at 84.6 and Johnson at 82.2.\n\nThat seems simple enough, but things get complicated from there.\n\nWe also looked at the Miller Center of Public Affairs' website, which he cited for saying he was second only to Johnson. The book's afterword quoted the site directly:\n\n\"Carter gained a reputation for political ineptitude, even though his actual record in dealing with Congress belied that image. His success rate in getting presidential initiatives through Congress was much higher than that of Bush [...] Carter was also close to Johnson's success rates, and higher than Kennedy's record.\"\n\nThe problem is that the website has since been revised since the book was published. Carter's CQ scores contradict it, so it was changed to avoid confusion, a Miller Center spokeswoman said.\n\nThe Miller Center's assessment that Carter's congressional record is much better than it is perceived still stands, the spokeswoman emphasized. \u00a0 \n\nWe located no study that found Carter was second only to Johnson. Still, even if he's third behind Kennedy, who did not serve a full term, the change does not make that big of a difference, said Steven H. Hochman, director of research at the Carter Center.\n\n\"The difference was just Kennedy. Was he before or behind Kennedy? And it's not too much of a difference,\" Hochman said.\n\nNow for the tough part.\n\u00a0 \nThere are many ways to assess a president's legislative success. Scholars think CQ's measure is helpful, but it does not take into account whether the president manages to turn his proposals into law. For instance, a tax package might pass the Senate but fail in the House. CQ would count the Senate vote as a success even though the overall effort failed.\n\nFurthermore, it may not be fair to compare the average of a two-term president with Carter's single term, one scholar noted. Second-term scores tend to be lower and drag a president's overall average down. If you compare first terms only, Carter drops to fourth behind Dwight D. Eisenhower. \n\nAnd if you look at how many of Carter's initiatives actually were enacted, his record is unexceptional. According to an analysis by Andrew Rudalevige, a political science professor at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa., who has studied presidential legislative successes, only 44 percent of his initiatives became law. This puts him behind Johnson, Bill Clinton, Eisenhower, George H.W. Bush and Kennedy, in that order. (Eisenhower and George H.W. Bush are tied.)\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nPlus, if you compare Carter to other presidents who served while their parties controlled both the House and Senate, he's at or near the bottom, according to another analysis published in 1990. \u00a0\n\nStill, Carter won nearly 70 percent of his contested and important votes, according to CQ numbers cited in Rudalevige's analysis. \u00a0\n\nOther problems with the CQ score are that it doesn't measure whether a president's proposal was watered down, or take into account whether he worked under unusually hostile conditions.\n\nAnd Carter did push an ambitious agenda during a very difficult time, experts agreed. His proposals included reforms on health care, welfare and energy, topics that remain difficult today.\n\nFurthermore, the Democratic Party was deeply divided during Carter's administration. Reforms in the House of Representatives dispersed power more widely among its members, making it difficult to influence the body as a whole.\n\nEven Johnson, who is renowned for his legislative skill, would have struggled under those conditions, notes Mark A. Peterson, a professor at the University of California Los Angeles who has written extensively on presidential legislative successes.\n\n\"Yes, by one measure Carter did very well legislatively, but not quite as well as he has claimed,\" Peterson said. He didn't do well compared to other presidents whose parties had majorities in both houses of Congress, but considering his party's divisions, his achievements are notable, he added.\u00a0\n\n\"And by another measure that really matters -- actually enacting legislation -- Carter fared quite poorly, with the recognition that he tried to push a bold, difficult agenda,\" Peterson said.\u00a0\n\nOverall, though, experts we interviewed said Carter's legislative record exceeds its reputation.\n\n\"It's somewhat of a mixed case, but it is more successful than most people think,\" Rudalevige said.\n\nConsider his victory on the 1978 Panama Canal treaties, noted George C. Edwards III, a professor of political science at Texas A&M University who has written about Carter's legislative record. In 1976, almost half of the Senate pledged they would vote against altering the existing arrangement. Carter managed to get the two-thirds vote needed to change it in 1978.\n\nNow, what do we make of all this?\n\nWe found no evidence that Carter's record surpassed every president since Eisenhower's but Johnson's, but according to one measure, he was close.\n\nA broader look at Carter's legislative record showed it was mixed. In at least one case, the Panama Canal treaties, his achievement was exceptional.\n\nYet while his proposals garnered favorable votes in one chamber, many never became law. It's hard to call that a true record of legislative success.\u00a0\n\nStill, he did better than most people think.\n\nAJC PolitiFact Georgia defines Half True as an accurate statement that leaves out important details or take things out of context"}
{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Duncan Hunter \"We waterboard, incidentally, hundreds of our own military personnel. They waterboard themselves in training to toughen themselves up.\"", "evidence": "In a discussion on MSNBC's  Hardball  program about whether the government ought to consider prosecuting people involved in enhanced interrogation techniques used on some terror suspects, former U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, a Republican from California, argued that the issue really comes down to waterboarding.\n\n\"And,\" he said, \"waterboarding is not torture.\"\n\nIn fact, said Hunter, a Vietnam veteran and former candidate for president, \"We waterboard, incidentally, hundreds of our own military personnel. They waterboard themselves in training to toughen themselves up.\"\n\nHe added, \"The Geneva Convention .. .was analyzed by the lawyers in place, and they came to the conclusion, especially about waterboarding, because that's the primary thing, that, since we do it to our own soldiers, by the hundreds, incidentally, and it doesn't hurt them, and they \u2014 and it makes them tougher, and it doesn't hurt anybody \u2014 Khalid Sheikh Mohammed gained weight after he was waterboarded \u2014 we decided that, since we do that to our own soldiers in training... we\u2018re not going to consider that torture. \"\n\nHunter later challenged host Chris Matthews saying, \"But the point is, if we do it, are we torturing American soldiers? You have to answer yes if you consider waterboarding to be torture.\"\n\nMatthews said the difference is that U.S. service people know they are in training. They know they aren't going to be killed. \"That captured person who is one of our enemies has no idea what we\u2018re doing when we submit him to water torture.\"\n\nSaid Hunter: \"If we use it with our own soldiers in training, as we do waterboarding, then it should be allowed with people who have killed thousands of Americans.\"\n\nWe decided to examine Hunter's claim about waterboarding our service personnel as part of their training and found that he is right.\n\nU.S. special operations troops have, in the past, sometimes used a form of waterboarding as part of survival exercises, called Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape training. The idea is to prepare them in the event they are ever captured and interrogated with such means.\n\nAccording to reports in the  New York Times  and  Vanity Fair,  the CIA adopted some of the interrogation techniques used on terror suspects from that SERE training, including the use of waterboarding.\n\nAccording to the  Vanity Fair  story, three-week SERE training for the U.S. soldiers included waterboarding, forced nudity, extreme temperatures, sexual and religious ridicule, agonizing stress positions, and starvation-level rations. The story quotes Michael Rolince, former section chief of the FBI's International Terrorism Operations: \"You're not going to die, but you think you are.\"\n\nBut while the techniques may have been derived from SERE training, a different, more intense brand of waterboarding was used on terror suspects, according to recently released CIA documents.\n\nAccording to a May 7, 2004, CIA Inspector General special report on interrogation techniques used on terror suspects, which has some parts redacted, \"OIG\u2019s (Office of the Inspector General's) review of the videotapes revealed that the waterboard technique employed at (redacted) was different from the technique as described in the DoJ (Department of Justice) opinion and used in the SERE training. The difference was in the manner in which the detainee\u2019s breathing was obstructed. At the SERE School and in the DoJ opinion, the subject\u2019s airflow is disrupted by the firm application of a damp cloth over the air passages; the interrogator applies a small amount of water to the cloth in a controlled manner. By contest, the Agency interrogator (redacted) continuously applied large volumes of water to a cloth that covered the detainee\u2019s mouth and nose. One of the psychologists/interrogators acknowledged that the Agency\u2019s use of the technique differed from that used in SERE training and explained that the Agency\u2019s technique is different because it is 'for real' and is more poignant and convincing.\"\n\nThe report also says the CIA's Office of Medical Services has characterized the SERE waterboarding as \"so different from the subsequent Agency usage as to make it almost irrelevant.\" The office said its frequency and intensity raised questions about whether it was effective or medically safe.\n\nSo we think Hunter misleads a bit by equating waterboarding in training of military personnel with the technique used on terror suspects. According to the CIA inspector general's report, the technique used on the suspects was more powerful and convincing. And in the case of one terror suspect, it was used 183 times, often in rapid succession. So to argue the technique isn't torture because it is used on American servicemen as part of training ignores that it was not used in the same way.\n\nStill, Hunter is correct that the U.S. military has waterboarded servicemen as part of survival training"}

We decided to fact-check this claim: \"In 2011, texting surpassed alcohol as the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths.\"\nThere\u2019s little doubt that texting is a danger in automobile safety.

The first recorded public use in English was when President James Madison spoke to a delegation of Indian tribes at President\u2019s House in Washington at the onset of the War of 1812.\nMadison talked about \"the red people who live on the same great island with the white people.\" Two tribal leaders referred to themselves as \"redskins\" in response.\nGoddard further traced the term to an 1815 speech by Meskwaki chief Black Thunder amid peace treaty negotiations. Addressing the governor of the Missouri Territory, Black Thunder said, \"I have never injured you, and innocence can feel no fear. I turn to all, redskins and white skins, and challenge an accusation against me.\"\nThe point of Goddard\u2019s research: The term \"redskins\" was born as a neutral description of American Indians during a limited, positive time between colonials and some tribal nations.\nHegseth went further, though, describing its use as a \"a term of respect.\"\nHollywood western culture\nNancy Shoemaker, a University of Connecticut history professor who studied the etymology of \"red\" references to Indians, said she considers Goddard\u2019s work thorough but wished he had tracked the word post-1826.

For this fact check, we focused on whether the Obama plan eliminates coal-fired plants \u2014 a claim the Texas office of the Environmental Defense Fund brought to our attention, calling it inaccurate.\nTo our inquiry, a foundation spokeswoman, Caroline Espinosa, conceded by email that under the Environmental Protection Agency plan, all \"coal-fired plants are not eliminated, though,\" she said, \"a great number of them will be: enough to cause grievous harm to the Texas economy and Texas families.\"\nLet\u2019s summarize the plan, which is to be finalized this year, then explore its impact on coal-fired electricity plants.\nClean Power Plan\nThe Clean Power Plan is premised on the states by 2030 collectively driving down carbon emissions from power plants by 30 percent from 2005 levels \u2014 in part, the agency has said, through regional \"cap and trade\" networks, investments in renewable energy and smart grid technology \u2014 plus phase-outs of many existing coal-fueled plants.\n\"Power plants,\" the EPA says in a fact sheet last updated in June 2015, \"are the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States, making up roughly one-third of all domestic greenhouse gas emissions.\"\nA 2014 fact check\nBut PolitiFact concluded previously that the plan doesn\u2019t outlaw coal as fuel or require coal-fired plants to close. In August 2014, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., rated False a claim by U.S. Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., that the administration plan meant coal would not be permitted as an electricity fuel, even in limited amounts.\nIn 2014, Michael Webber, deputy director of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin, said: \"In no way does this program say coal can\u2019t live. What it is is a death blow for outdated, old, vintage coal plants, unless they pay for\" technology upgrades.\nAmy Jaffe, executive director of Energy and Sustainability at the University of California, Davis, said at the time that states would influence the process as each one creates its blueprint for decreasing emissions. \"It may be in some places there is nothing you can do other than stop using coal, but there's nothing in the rules that says there can\u2019t be coal,\" Jaffe said.\nEPA: Plan doesn't mandate retirement of coal-fired plants\nTo our inquiry, a Washington-based EPA spokeswoman, Enesta Jones, said by email \"EPA\u2019s proposal provides each state with enormous flexibility to design plans that meet their individual and unique needs, and does not mandate the retirement of any coal plants.\"\nNationally, though, coal is expected to recede as a fuel. The EPA\u2019s initial estimates assumed 30 percent of the country\u2019s energy would come from coal in 2030, down from 39 percent in 2013. According to the agency, the plan gives each state a different threshold for reducing carbon emissions it must reach based on feasibility, cost and current pollution levels, among factors. And, the agency says, it\u2019s up to each state to decide how to comply.\nFederal rules against mercury emissions, which experts have described as more stringent than the pending power plan, also could factor into coal fading.\nFoundation cites national and Texas studies\nEspinosa, elaborating on Henneke\u2019s claim, told us there are reasons to expect Texas plants to close due to the plan.\nBy email, she pointed out a May 2015 analysis of the plan undertaken by the U.S. Energy Information Administration at the request of U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology.\nNationally under the plan, the report says, projected coal plant \"retirements,\" meaning closings, would total 90 gigawatts in power generation, most of that occurring by 2020. That prediction compares with an expected retirement of 40 gigawatts in coal-fueled power if the plan doesn\u2019t take effect, the report says. New plants, the report says,would largely be fueled by natural gas and renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power.\n\n"}

At least part of the story showed up in a couple of other posts also questioned by Facebook users.\nAldean was performing onstage at a Las Vegas country music festival on Oct. 1 when a gunman opened fire on the crowd from a hotel room, killing 58 and injuring 489 more.

Whitman\u2019s fusillade ended when he was shot and killed at short range.\nKOKE host Bob Cole followed up, asking Adler if he was saying Whitman represented \"the first mass shooting in our country.\"\n\"That\u2019s what I\u2019m told,\" Adler replied. \"First one.\"\nNo doubt, Whitman holds broad significance. Texas author Gary Lavergne\u2019s 1997 book, \"A Sniper in the Tower: The Charles Whitman Murders,\" says: \"With deadly efficiency, he introduced America to public mass murder, and in the process forever changed our notions of safety in open spaces.\" Before 1966, Lavergne wrote, \"mass murder was so rare that the\" criminal justice \"system had no special category or documentation for it. Statistics and prosecutors had treated such criminals and their crimes in the same manner as a single murder.\"\nHowever, mass shootings take in far more events than Adler acknowledged, making this Austin-was-first statement incorrect.\nAdler spokesman concedes error\nMayoral spokesman Jason Stanford owned up to error when we inquired into the basis of Adler\u2019s statement. By email, Stanford said he\u2019d given the mayor the \"first mass shooting\" conclusion based on what he\u2019d personally heard since moving to Austin in the 1990s.\nNext, we looked at news stories fetched from electronic archives, finding that the Austin American-Statesman didn\u2019t deem Whitman the nation\u2019s first mass shooter, at least in recent decades.\nRather, a July 1991 American-Statesman news story called the day\u2019s events \"one of the worst mass killings in American history.\"\nLater in 1991, the Associated Press recapped the death of Richard Speck, who \"shocked the nation in 1966 by stabbing and strangling eight student nurses\" in a night. That story quoted James Alan Fox, then dean of Northeastern University\u2019s College of Criminal Justice, saying the Speck slayings marked the start of America's \"age of mass murder. Mass murder was not something that was in our vocabulary until Richard Speck,\" Fox said. Whitman, the story noted, fired from the UT Tower two weeks after the Speck murders.\nDefining mass shootings\nThat story's mention of Fox prompted us to seek the professor\u2019s analysis of Adler\u2019s statement.\nBy phone, Fox reminded us that a mass shooting has conventionally been defined as one involving four or more deaths by gunfire, not counting military operations or shoot-outs connected to gang activity or other crimes, all in the same one-day period--a definition he sticks with, he said, for the sake of comparisons over time.\nThat definition is in keeping with a 2008 FBI report stating that over the previous three decades, a mass murder was defined as four or more murders occurring during the same incident, with no distinctive time period between the murders--though later, a 2012 law set the federal threshold for a \"mass killing\" \u00a0as three or more people killed, we noted in a January 2016 fact check.\n\n"}

Sherrod Brown in 2012, but that hasn't stopped them from opening the campaign.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), which assists election efforts, made that clear by issuing a series of news releases after Brown spoke at a January luncheon of the Akron Roundtable.\n\nOne release, citing coverage in the Akron Beacon Journal, went after the senator \"in light of Brown\u2019s admission that his $787 billion stimulus law failed, and his sudden election-cycle flip-flop to demand more tax cuts.\"\n\n\"After specifically attacking Republicans for wanting to lower Americans' taxes, Brown now claims that his stimulus bill 'didn't do enough' to lower taxes,\" the NRSC\u2019s Chris Bond said.\n\nListening to the talk and reading the Beacon Journal story, however, we did not hear the same \"admission.\" Here is what the story said:\n\n\"Brown defended the federal government's fiscal actions during the Great Recession, saying it was necessary to borrow nearly $1.5 trillion to rescue and stimulate the economy and prevent a global collapse. The efforts also helped save major manufacturers such as General Motors and Chrysler, he said.\n\n\"The subsequent $787 billion Recovery Act that passed in early 2009 didn't do enough, particularly with tax cuts, to get people to spend more or build public confidence in the economy, he said.\n\n\"But the federal government's investments in domestic automakers helped tremendously, Brown said, with the economy now growing and adding jobs.\n\n\"If the government hadn't acted, the state would have been in much worse shape, Brown said.\"\n\nHe did not say the stimulus failed. He said it was not large enough, which he has said consistently.\n\nAs for tax reductions, Brown said the tax cuts \"didn\u2019t do what they should have. They weren\u2019t large enough, as it turned out, to get people to spend more, they weren\u2019t public enough to help it build public confidence in our economy.\"\n\nIn explanation, Brown\u2019s office cited a New York Times/CBS News Poll of September 2010, which found that fewer than one in 10 respondents knew that the stimulus had lowered taxes for most Americans, giving typical families an extra $65 a month.\n\nFew people noticed the tax cut because, instead of getting rebate checks, taxpayers had less money withheld from their paychecks, Brown\u2019s staff said. Increases in health-insurance deductions, increases in state taxes in 30 states and cutbacks in business also reduced take-home pay.\n\nBut what about the claim that Brown specifically attacked Republicans for wanting to lower Americans' taxes?\n\nBrown was a vocal opponent of extending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of taxpayers, which he said have failed to stimulate the economy. He did vote in favor of their extension last December, but said it was only because the bill extended tax reductions for the middle class and included billions of dollars in unemployment benefits.\n\nSo where does the NRSC land on the Truth-O-Meter?\n\u00a0\n\n"}

Marco Rubio is a key to the Republicans\u2019 hope to capture more of the Hispanic vote in 2016. And to achieve that goal, Rubio -- a potential presidential contender -- wants to be the face of the GOP\u2019s immigration plans.\n\nRubio unveiled his plan for immigration legislation in the Wall Street Journal on Jan. 12. Rubio\u2019s plan calls for allowing more immigrants into the country who bring investment or skills, a guest-worker program for farm laborers and a path to citizenship for certain \u00a0people in the United States illegally.\n\nRubio sees his immigration plan as something that can spur economic growth.\n\n\"I'm a big believer in family based immigration,\" Rubio told the Journal. \"But I don't think that in the 21st century we can continue to have an immigration system where only 6.5 percent of people who come here, come here based on labor and skill.

The author, Brookings vice president Darrell West, called for immigration reform that in the short term would allow employers to hire workers with scientific and technological skills.\n\nWest argued that some other countries such as Canada have already crafted policies to attract skilled and unskilled workers. Canada gives applicants points based on their field of study, education and employment experience.\n\n\"Some 36 percent of all Canadian immigrant visas are in the \u2018skilled-worker\u2019 category, as opposed to only 6.5 percent in the United States,\" West wrote. We contacted West to ask how he arrived at his figure.\n\nWest told us in an email that there are different numbers depending on the immigrant category and the definition of skilled workers. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security publishes numbers that relate to \"legal permanent residents\" and how many are family sponsored or employment-based.\n\n\"But even those numbers are not exact, because the employment category combines skilled and unskilled workers,\" West wrote. \u00a0\"My 6.5 percent figure was my best approximation of the conflicting numbers that exist in this area.\"\n\nWe looked at the numbers ourselves and found the vast majority of immigrants are accepted for family unification and a smaller slice are for employment, though the numbers vary depending on the type of visa and employment.\n\nWest\u2019s number drew from a group known as legal permanent residents. In 2011, a total of 1,062,040 persons became legal permanent residents. Family sponsored was the largest category for people who earned this status in 2011. Employment-based preferences accounted for 13.1 percent.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security provides a breakdown for people receiving the employment-based preferences. \"Professionals with advanced degrees\" accounted for 6.3 percent. Another category combined \"skilled workers, professionals and unskilled workers,\" and that accounted for 3.5 percent. (The combined category makes it difficult to pluck out a number for only \"skilled\" workers.) The 2011 Yearbook of immigrant statistics shows that within those employment categories, the numbers reflect not just workers, but their spouses and children.\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn an interview on reforming our immigration system, Rubio said \"I'm a big believer in family based immigration.

Fathers in the home.\"\nAfter reportedly being booed at the event, Ives, an Illinois state representative from Wheaton, repeated \"fathers in the home,\" according to the Chicago Tribune.\nThe Ives campaign later doubled down on the comment, explaining in a statement released to media that \"many have advocated the same idea, including President Obama.\"\nThe Ives statement quoted from a 2008 Father\u2019s Day speech in which then-candidate Obama, himself raised mostly by a single mother and her parents, called on fathers to own up to their family responsibilities.\nSo is Ives seeking to further an idea that was earlier championed by Obama? Did Obama say fathers actively raising their children will solve the epidemic of gun violence in Chicago?

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Haley Barbour \"It took Obama six months to pick out a family dog,\" but he's \"cramming health care reform down the country's throat in a fraction of that time.\"", "evidence": "Republicans have been complaining for weeks that President Barack Obama is trying to rush his health care reform bill through Congress. To make their point now, they've gone to the dogs.\n\n\nIn an Aug. 13 op-ed in the\n\nWashington Examiner\n\n, Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour invoked Bo, the White House dog, to illustrate how quickly Obama has tried to pass the 1,000-page bill. Barbour, who chairs the Republican Governors Association and has been mentioned as a possible 2012 presidential contender, wrote, \"It took Obama six months to pick out a family dog. Cramming health care reform down the country's throat in a fraction of that time scares people who have been told, accurately, the various bills contain a billion-dollar combination of tax increases and Medicare spending cuts.\"\n\n\nTo judge whether Obama tried to pass the bill \"in a fraction\" of the time it took him to choose the Portuguese water dog requires examining the\n\ntimeline\n\nfor both the health care bill and the selection of Bo. And that's not as easy it might sound.\n\n\nWe could choose various dates for the beginning of the dog selection. We could go as far back as Obama's mention of his dog promise in an interview with\n\nMen's Health\n\nmagazine in August 2008, or as recently as his inauguration on Jan. 20, when he and his family moved into the White House. But we believe it's fair to say the process started with the Obama election night celebration on Nov. 4, 2008, when Obama declared that his daughters Sasha and Malia \"have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the White House.\" It was at that point that speculation began in earnest about what kind of dog they might get.\n\n\nThe end date for the puppy hunt is a little imprecise as well. According to the definitive\n\nWashington Post\n\naccount of the dog search, Bo had a \"clandestine White House visit in which he won over the Obama girls and their parents\" some time in March or early April. Not knowing exactly when it took place, we'll date the end of the search on April 12, when word of the new pooch became breaking news.\n\n\nTotal elapsed time: 160 days. That's a bit less than the six months Barbour cited, but we think it's a reasonable estimate and won't knock Barbour for being a bit off.\n\n\nNow, on to more serious matters: health care reform.\n\n\nHere too we face some choices about the start and end dates. We could go all the way back to May 29, 2007, when candidate Obama first unveiled a comprehensive health care proposal in Iowa. Or we could use March 5, 2009, when Obama invited lawmakers and industry leaders to the White House for a forum that included \"breakout sessions\" and a question-and-answer period to discuss the possible elements of health care legislation. Or we could use July 14, 2009, when House Democratic leaders formally introduced H.R. 3200, the massive bill that's still under discussion.\n\n\nAfter much internal discussion, we settled on March 5, the date of the forum. That was the point when the Obama administration signaled that health care reform was a key priority. Obama told participants that the forum was \"the first discussion in this effort, but it was not the last.\"\n\n\nAs for the end date, Democratic leaders and the White House tried to have the bills passed by the House and the Senate by the start of the August recess \u2014 July 31, 2009, for the House and Aug. 7, 2009, for the Senate. It didn't happen, but that seems to be what Barbour was referring to when he said Obama had tried to \"cram\" the legislation through. (Barbour's office did not respond to our request for more details.)\n\n\nIf you start the clock on March 5 and stop it at Aug. 7, it works out to 156 days. That is just a smidgen less than the 160 days it took to find Bo, but it's very close, so it is a stretch to say, as Barbour did, that the health care effort took \"a fraction\" of the time it took to find a dog.\n\n\nA more favorable comparison from Barbour's perspective would be to start the clock with the introduction of the House bill on July 14. That would make the total duration of the debate a mere 25 days. Using those dates, Barbour would be right to call it a fraction of the 160-day-long dog search. However, choosing such a late start date strikes us as cherry-picking. The health care discussion among lawmakers, the media and the public was well under way by July 14, and the details of the bill had been swirling for weeks, even if they were not in legislative language yet.\n\n\nUltimately, determining whether Barbour is right depends on which dates you choose. Let us propose an additional caveat, however. No one ever promised that a bill would be ready for the president to sign by the start of August recess. Even if the original goal was to have a bill through both chambers by then, it would still require a House-Senate conference committee to iron out what were sure to be significant differences. Once lawmakers managed to hammer out a consensus bill, both chambers would need time to debate the new measure, pass the bill individually, and send it on to the president. That would likely take several weeks.\n\n\nGiven this reality, another conceivable ending date would actually be Oct. 30, 2009 \u2014 the target date for the House to adjourn. Using that as the end date, the duration of the health care debate would be 240 days (when starting with March 5, which would be much longer than picking the dog) or 109 days (when starting with July 14, or shorter than the dog selection but not really \"a fraction.\").\n\n\nSo this is one where reasonable people can reach different conclusions.

{"label": "true", "claim": "Sean Hannity Under President Barack Obama\u2019s jobs bill, \"you can sue if you are unemployed and don't get the job and think you weren't hired because you are unemployed.\"", "evidence": "During the Sept. 13, 2011, edition of Sean Hannity\u2019s show on the Fox News Channel, Hannity said that President Barack Obama\u2019s jobs bill included a new way for Americans to sue for discrimination.\n\nIn a discussion with former Florida State University football coach Bobby Bowden and Tucker Carlson, the editor of the Daily Caller, a conservative website, Hannity said that, under the bill, unemployed people would be able to sue for discrimination if they felt their status had kept them from getting a job.\n\n\"There is a class where they could sue the employer they've interviewed with because they were discriminated against, because they were unemployed,\" Hannity said. \"If I'm an employer and they implement that, I'm not going to interview anybody.\"\n\nCarlson added, \"There's a new category to the Civil Rights Act with race, ethnicity.\"\n\nHannity continued, \"You can sue if you are unemployed and don't get the job and think you weren't hired because you are unemployed.\"\n\nCarlson replied that such a provision was a \"giveaway to the trial lawyers.\"\n\n\"We've gone entitlement crazy,\" Bowden said.\n\n\"We have,\" Hannity agreed.\n\nWe were curious about whether Hannity described the proposal correctly. We began by turning to the bill itself.\n\nThe provision in question follows news reports that some companies have rejected unemployed job applicants out of hand as a way of filtering the large numbers of job resumes they\u2019re receiving. In some cases, companies even made it clear in advertisements that they would not consider applicants who were unemployed.\n\nSince unemployment levels have remained stuck for months at near post-Great Depression highs, such practices posed a challenge for an administration that desperately wants to boost employment. So the bill states the overarching position that \"denial of employment opportunities to individuals because of their status as unemployed is discriminatory.\"\n\nSpecifically, the bill prohibits employers from publishing help-wanted ads that disqualify people who are unemployed, and bars employers from failing to consider or hire an individual \"because of the individual's status as unemployed.\" The bill places similar restrictions on employment agencies.\n\nAs for enforcement of the new provision, the bill says that \"a court of the United States shall have the same jurisdiction and powers as the court has to enforce ... Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\" -- the landmark provision that bans employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin.\n\nAn individual who seeks redress through the courts, the bill says, \"may be awarded, as appropriate\" an order to employers to stop the prohibited practices, \"reimbursement of costs expended as a result of the unlawful employment practice,\" damages up to $1,000 for each day of the violation, and \"reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\"\n\nLynne Bernabei, a Washington employment lawyer best known for representing whistleblowers, agreed that Hannity described the law accurately, though she said that individuals suing under the new provisions -- if they are ultimately enacted as written -- will still face a steep climb in the courts before they secure any compensation.\n\n\"Any individual suing under this law has to prove that he was discriminated against because he was unemployed,\" Bernabei said. \"Discrimination is always difficult to prove, and it wouldn't be any easier to prove in this context.\"\n\nBut Hannity didn\u2019t suggest that plaintiffs would somehow be assured of winning in court; he simply said that they would have the opportunity to sue"}
{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Edward Lindsey \"As governor, [Mitt Romney] balanced the budget without raising taxes and created jobs.\"", "evidence": "Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is trying to gain support for his presidential bid in Georgia, and one of his chief supporters here recently offered a case for Romney\u2019s candidacy we found quite interesting.\n\n\"Georgians are suffering under the leadership of President [Barack] Obama. Mitt Romney is the candidate with the vision and experience to turn around the failing economy,\" Edward Lindsey, a Republican state representative from Atlanta, said in a news release pumped out Aug. 22 by the Romney campaign.\n\nLindsey, the House majority whip, one of the most influential positions in the Georgia Legislature, added: \"As governor, [Romney] balanced the budget without raising taxes and created jobs. He has the experience in both the private and public sectors to get Americans back to work.\"\n\nRomney, widely considered one of the Republican front-runners, is trying to make the argument that he can do a better job than Obama in managing the American economy. The candidate that makes the best argument will likely win the presidency in 2012. With that in mind, we wondered whether Lindsey is right about Romney\u2019s record in Massachusetts. Did he balance the budget without raising taxes and create jobs?\n\nWe talked briefly to Lindsey, who referred our questions about his claim to the Romney campaign.\n\nSo first, let\u2019s deal with the budget question. Romney took office as Massachusetts\u2019 governor in January 2003. The Massachusetts economy, like much of the country, was struggling before he took office. In 2002, Massachusetts leaders passed tax increases that raised revenue by about $1 billion, said Mike Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Tax Foundation.\n\nIn 2003, the money problems continued, and it was now Romney\u2019s job to find solutions. That year, the Massachusetts Legislature balanced the budget through spending cuts and raised revenue through some revisions of the corporate tax code. Romney signed off on several other corporate tax revisions in 2004 and 2005. Those changes resulted in an additional $350 million in revenue, Widmer said. When Romney left office, Massachusetts collected about $18 billion in revenue.\n\nWere those code changes a tax increase?\n\nRomney officials call them \"loopholes.\" Widmer refers to them as \"corporate tax increases.\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t fault Romney,\" Widmer said. \"I commend him and the Legislature for the balanced approach that they took.\"\n\nNoah Berger, president of the Massachusetts Budget & Policy Center, does not believe they are tax increases.\n\n\"I think it\u2019s fair to say that\u2019s different than raising taxes,\" Berger said of the changes.\n\nThe issue has been debated for years.\n\n\"[Romney\u2019s] indicating that he balanced a budget without raising taxes is misleading at best,\" Brian Gilmore, executive vice president of Associated Industries of Massachusetts, the state's largest business lobbying group, told MSNBC in 2007. \"We respectfully disagree.\"\n\nRomney officials countered that he was trying to stop some companies from using \"aggressive accounting\" to reduce their tax liability. The changes, according to MSNBC, included real estate investment trust subsidiaries created by banks to hold mortgages. The parent banks received dividend income from the trusts and took advantage of deductions to lower their state taxes.\n\nRomney campaign spokesman Ryan Williams told us the candidate was under pressure from the Legislature, which he described as 87 percent Democrat and among the most \"liberal\" in the country, to raise taxes. Romney, he said several times, resisted and did not raise \"broad-based taxes.\" We asked whether we should then consider the corporate tax code changes a tax increase.\n\n\"[Romney] did not increase taxes to solve a difficult situation,\" Williams said.\n\nAs for job creation, federal data show the number of employed Massachusetts residents grew by about 1.3 percent during Romney\u2019s four years as governor. The job growth was greater than population growth. Critics argue Romney cannot make much of a case that he was a great job creator as governor. Massachusetts was ahead of only Louisiana, Michigan and Ohio in the percentage of job growth during Romney\u2019s four years in office. Louisiana leaders then had an excuse for slow job growth, contending with the aftermath of a hurricane called Katrina.\n\nSome economics experts argue governors should get little credit, or blame, for job growth. Williams, the Romney spokesman, correctly noted that unemployment fell from 5.6 percent the month Romney took office in 2003 to 4.6 percent four years later. He also correctly pointed out that Massachusetts had lost jobs in each of the two years before Romney took office. Massachusetts also had about 30,000 fewer employed residents in the two years after he was no longer governor.\n\nTechnically, Lindsey has a point on both parts of that specific quote. Romney did preside over an increase in job growth as governor. As past research has shown, it was smaller than nearly every other state. There was improvement, however, on the employment front when he was governor.\n\nAs for taxes, Massachusetts didn\u2019t raise the property tax rate or other traditional types of taxes during Romney\u2019s time as governor. But he did close several corporate loopholes, which resulted in companies paying more taxes"}

A transcript of her interviews was provided by the FDA.\nMany of the doctors\u2019 reports submitted with the application were \"more testimonials than scientific studies,\" Kelsey said.\nShe also looked into reports that thalidomide\u2019s side effects for adults included painful tingling in the hands and feet. Thousands of babies whose mothers took the drug while pregnant were born with severe defects to their limbs, internal organs, eyesight and hearing.\u00a0\n\n"}
{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Rick Scott \"The average person only pays about $1,800 in state taxes \u2014 which is the lowest of all 50 states.\"", "evidence": "Florida Gov. Rick Scott rattled off a laundry list of first-term accomplishments during his State of the State speech March 3, 2015. Chief among them were his efforts to cut taxes in the Sunshine State the past four years.\n\"We are home to over 250 languages. We are at a 43-year-low in our crime rate. We are absolutely the best melting pot in the world. Housing prices are up. And taxes are down,\" Scott said. \"We have cut taxes more than 40 times in the last four years. We have no personal income tax and the average person only pays about $1,800 in state taxes \u2014 which is the lowest of all 50 states.\"\nAs we said in another fact-check, the bit about cutting taxes more than 40 times rates Half True. Here, we decided to look at Scott\u2019s claim that the average person pays $1,800 a year in state taxes, the lowest of all 50 states.\nWe crunched the numbers ourselves and compared that to multiple other tax watchdogs that use U.S. Census data to calculate taxes collected per capita.\nAccording to the Florida Department of Revenue, the state collected about $33.6 billion in taxes in fiscal year 2014. In 2013, Florida\u2019s population, according to the U.S. Census, was about 19.6 million. Do the math, and that\u2019s $1,711 taxes collected per capita.\nScott\u2019s office pointed us to the Federation of Tax Administrators, a nonpartisan group that serves the principal tax collection agencies in all 50 states. A 2013 analysis based on data from the U.S. Census, which surveys every state government each year to ask how much they collected in taxes, found the taxes Florida collected per capita were $1,769. That number was also cited by the Kaiser Family Foundation, another nonpartisan organization.\nBoth those figures are close to the number Scott cited. But there\u2019s a notable difference between taxes collected per capita and how much \"the average person pays,\" as Scott put it.\nTo arrive at the per capita figure, you\u2019re including millions of people, namely children, who either pay no taxes or some nominal amount (the sales tax on a toy purchased with allowance money, for example).\nWith this caveat in mind, looking at taxes collected per capita is still a useful tool for comparing tax burdens across state lines. It\u2019s not a perfect comparison \u2014 some states may have larger proportions of their residents who pay taxes \u2014 but it is used by several national tax policy groups.\n\n"}
{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Farouk Shami \"When we go to vote, they ask for driver's license and verify that you are a voter and a citizen in the state of Texas.\"", "evidence": "In the run up to Tuesday's primary election, Pasco schools superintendent Heather Fiorentino sent out a campaign mailer aiming to distinguish herself from challenger Kurt Browning.\n\nFiorentino, who has trailed Browning in campaign contributions and endorsements, for the second time attacked the former two-time Florida secretary of state as a \"double dipper\" and a former Democrat. She also rolled out a new contention, that Browning \"allowed 1,800 illegal voters to register in Florida\" during his tenure.\n\nBrowning scoffed at the claim, which includes a number of alleged noncitizen voters we'd never seen before. We set out in search of her facts.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nIn early 2011, while Browning was secretary of state, the Division of Elections learned the Department of Motor Vehicles maintained a database that categorized driver's license holders as citizens and noncitizens, spokesman Chris Cate said. (Cate worked at the time for Browning; he and his wife have since donated $50 to Browning's campaign.)\n\nAfter a discussion with Gov. Rick Scott, Browning decided to take a closer look at just how many noncitizens might be registered to vote. Officials took the driver's license database and compared it to the state voter registration list.\n\nThe first pass-through generated 180,000 names of potential noncitizen voters, a number that was widely reported by the news media. But Browning was skeptical of that figure: The data was crunched by DMV, not his own department. And he suspected it included some people who obtained their citizenship and registered to vote after they got their last driver's license. The driver's license database might not reflect their current citizenship status.\n\nA later effort whittled the list down to 2,600 names, including about 1,400 verified matches from the first list and 1,200 people who get annual driver's licenses because they are on work or student visas. That list went to county elections supervisors to review.\n\nThose supervisors did their due diligence, giving the voters in question an opportunity to respond. Some voters quickly returned documents verifying their citizenship.\n\nPasco County Supervisor of Elections Brian Corley said of the 13 names he received, \"more than half were actually U.S. citizens.\" One woman was improperly flagged when her records were mistaken for someone else's, Corley said.\n\nAfter finding flaws in its methodology, the Department of State told supervisors of elections to stop using the list of 2,600 names.\n\n\"We consider that number obsolete now,\" Cate said. The state is working out an agreement with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to better identify noncitizens and compare that list to the voter rolls.\n\nAs for Fiorentino's flier: \"I don't know where they would come up with a number of 1,800,\" Cate said.\n\nFiorentino acknowledged her flier contained a typo: She meant to use the original 180,000 figure.\n\n\"I was kinder than it should have been,\" she said.\n\n"}

Under former President Barack Obama, she said, it was routine.\nAsked if the White House regretted that children were exposed to the tear gas, Sanders said the White House \"would never want children to be in harm's way in any capacity whatsoever\" and that law enforcement officers use appropriate non-lethal force to protect themselves and prevent an illegal rush at the border.\n\"And let's also not forget that this isn't the first time that non-lethal force like this has been used,\" Sanders said Nov. 27. \"In fact, tear gas was used, on average, once a month during the Obama administration for very similar circumstances.\"\nSanders added that the Obama administration used tear gas for \"far less circumstances because they didn't have the same numbers and the mass rush that we're seeing in this caravan take place.\"\nPolitiFact readers asked us to fact-check whether the Obama administration used tear gas on migrants on average once a month.\nData from the Department of Homeland Security back Sanders\u2019 claim.
