<s>Pretty awful incident to think about.</s>Such a tragedy for the people of Mozambique.Sounds incredibly unlucky, too, in that it might have even started with a lightning strike.Who even expects such a thing to happen, especially when youre just going about a normal day trying to buy fuel.Yes, it's crazy.  Imagine going to a gas station and having it catch on fire while you were there.I have to wonder what, if any, safeguards they had in place to prevent such an event, or if its even something that could have been foreseen.Yeah, I'm not sure.  It's probably pretty loosey-goosey I would think.  A type of lifestyle we don't experience.I feel terrible for those nearby who had to witness this.Yeah, that would be horrific.  The image of people trying to run into the water while they were on fire would stick with you, like people seeing folks jump off the twin towers during 9/11.  Horrible images.Very much so. And i doubt there will be any type of mental health support for the survivors.Yeah, for sure.  I think I'd be hesitant to buy fuel that way in the future, even if it's incredibly unlikely that something like that happens again.Absolutely. I would be terrified to ever do that again. And to think how distraught the families of the victims must be.

I remember standing and pumping my gas and thinking, "I could get shot at any moment now."

No one could have anticipated that, and I'm sure friends and relatives will ask "why" for the rest of their lives.There will certainly be lingering questions of why and whether it could have been prevented. Have you experienced any similar tragedies?No, nothing close to that.  I've seen some gnarly car accidents, but those you sort of understand as human error and that type of thing.  Something like this is just totally bonkers.Completely unexpected for sure.Have you ever visited Africa, or Mozambique in particular?I have not, but I have family from Africa. How about you?
Pretty awful incident to think about.Such a tragedy for the people of Mozambique.Sounds incredibly unlucky, too, in that it might have even started with a lightning strike.Who even expects such a thing to happen, especially when youre just going about a normal day trying to buy fuel.Yes, it's crazy.  Imagine going to a gas station and having it catch on fire while you were there.I have to wonder what, if any, safeguards they had in place to prevent such an event, or if its even something that could have been foreseen.Yeah, I'm not sure.  It's probably pretty loosey-goosey I would think.  A type of lifestyle we don't experience.I feel terrible for those nearby who had to witness this.Yeah, that would be horrific.  The image of people trying to run into the water while they were on fire would stick with you, like people seeing folks jump off the twin towers during 9/11.  Horrible images.<s>Very much so.

<s>Hi, what did you think of this?</s>It was so sad and horrific.  Your?I agree!  So sad!  and what a random, terrible event.I know - I didn't think they really knew what caused it.yeah they said either lightning striking or something elseI live in Colorado and most of our fires are caused by lightning.   We had that happen yesterday and the winds were at 65 mph.   It gets scary.oh wow, that IS scary!  I mean I guess to think that one could randomly be the victim of some tragedy caused by natural forces like that is really scary.  Hurricanes and tornadoes scare me.We don't have either of those but the fires just start quickly.   I live in the mountains of Colorado and fires are our biggest fear.   Difficult to get out and away.Yeah that is really scary.  I live in North Carolina and fires aren't really an issue but I'm always reading about wildfires out west, it seems crazy how entire towns will be just leveled and people lose everything.I know - do you live on the coast of North Carolina?No I would not do that, it's a similar situation there where they are just leveled by hurricanes regularly and sometimes they have a hard time getting out.  I'm inland.  We still get hit sometimes but it's usually not as bad.  Big trees falling on the house is a big threat and very scary but we usually get plenty of advance warning where we could leave if we wanted to.That's good - are you a UNC basketball fan?

I avoid thinking about negative things like that.  Both of those sound absolutely terrible to me.Me too - it was nice chatting with you today - goodbyeyeah you too!  have a good one, bye!
It was so sad and horrific.  Your?I agree!  So sad!  and what a random, terrible event.I know - I didn't think they really knew what caused it.yeah they said either lightning striking or something elseI live in Colorado and most of our fires are caused by lightning.   We had that happen yesterday and the winds were at 65 mph.   It gets scary.oh wow, that IS scary!  I mean I guess to think that one could randomly be the victim of some tragedy caused by natural forces like that is really scary.  Hurricanes and tornadoes scare me.We don't have either of those but the fires just start quickly.   I live in the mountains of Colorado and fires are our biggest fear.   Difficult to get out and away.Yeah that is really scary.  I live in North Carolina and fires aren't really an issue but I'm always reading about wildfires out west, it seems crazy how entire towns will be just leveled and people lose everything.I know - do you live on the coast of North Carolina?No I would not do that, it's a similar situation there where they are just leveled by hurricanes regularly and sometimes they have a hard time getting out.  I'm inland.  We still get hit sometimes but it's usually not as bad.  Big trees falling on the house is a big threat and very scary but we usually get plenty of advance warning where we could leave if we wanted to.That's good - are you a UNC basketball fan?<s>hahaha no just bc I'm not into sports but my mom and my sister both went there.  are you a fan?</s>I love any kind of basketball!    I am a KY wildcat fan.   I went to Vegas a couple of years ago and KY placed UNC.   Daggum Roy :)nice!  I know nothing about either one but it sounds like it was a fun experience.

Ugh.

<s>2815897278</s>That was such a sad article regarding China minersYeah, I can't imagine what it must have been like for the families waiting for them to be dug out of what ended up being their tomb.I live in Colorado but grew up in Kentucky.   So many miners died in Eastern Kentucky.  In comparison, there seems that China was incredibly terrible at giving the miners a safe work space.I don't think that mining will ever be considered a "safe" profession. Accidents happen.Yes they did.  I just always wondered how painful these accidents to those who just suffocate in the mine waiting on people to get to them.Slowly asphyxiating would be a horrible way to go, but with 33 people breathing they probably didn't have to wait long/Let's hope so.   As you already stated, the families waiting on the miners to be retrieved must be an experience that most never encounter.The weight of what little hope they had to see their loved one alive again must have been difficult to bear.All deaths are sad; however, this seems to be more challenging.  It would be an image I would never forget.Have you ever experienced the death of a loved one?I have.   I lost my dad at the age of 40.   He left 3 girls - 17, 15, 12.   My mom died at 76 of alzheimer's.   What about you?

My mom died at 76 of alzheimer's.   What about you?I'm sorry to hear that. I lost my best friend of 17 years at 22. My parents and grandparents are all still living and healthy.Your friend was so very young.  I'm sorry.   Enjoy your family every day because you just never know when that day comes.We try to get together often. Did the article mention what they were actually mining for?It did.  It was coal.  China is the biggest producer of coal as well as consuming it.It mentioned that they used ventilation fail safes to keep gas pockets from forming in the mines. Do you know how something like that works?<s>I don't.   I got to go in one deep coal mine because I made loans to those miners.   The only thing I saw were huge fans and they were vented out of the earth.  I do not know if that is the same thing though.</s>I wonder what the average age of a Chinese miner is.Just guessing I would think 18-65.   The State of Administration of Work Safety ordered an investigate of what happened.   I don't understand why they were not inspected more closely.Unfortunately, it usually takes tragedies like this for safety and procedure to be altered and followed more closely. Thanks for chatting today. byeGoodbye

<s>So this was clearly a sad situation, although I am glad they have caught the guy.

The only disturbing thing about him being "only a student/only 20" or whatever is that he's already managed to assault FIVE women. Bro clearly has no intention of shaping up.

There was also a study published recently talking about how bad alcohol abuse on campuses has gotten, and it linked blackout culture with the increase in assaults. So better drinking laws, especially for underage students, sounds like a good idea.

Your brain's not even fully developed until 25 and when you're chugging 7, 8, 9 beers at 18... Yipes.Yeah exactly, frontal lobe is still developing.  That's a pretty critical part of the brain.  Well I must go, it has been good speaking with you.  goodbyebye!
So this was clearly a sad situation, although I am glad they have caught the guy.  What did you think?I hate that he got away with hurting so many women before he was caught :(yeah no doubt, and probably even more than they know aboutAgreed. I hope he gets a better sentence than that athlete from awhile back >.>Yeah the famous athletes always seem to get a free pass.It's ridiculous. Like, they have clear evidence that they did it so it's not like it's up for debate, and then they get like three months or something.yes seriously  disgusting reallyYeah. What did you think of his lawyer's plea at the end of the article? About "politically correct culture" swaying opinion of the case?I think it's ridiculous, just a diversion tactic.  What did you think100% agree with you. Everyone's against him because he's been caught, not because of some agenda.Yeah, he is just trying to politicize the issue<s>Yeah. The only disturbing thing about him being "only a student/only 20" or whatever is that he's already managed to assault FIVE women. Bro clearly has no intention of shaping up.</s>No doubt!!!  At such a young age.  And probabloy way more women than thatMmmmmhm. The statistics on assault are horrifying; especially on campuses. Do you have any opinions on what should be done about it?I am really not sure.  I guess awareness is a big thing.  What do you think??Awareness, better accountability. There was also a study published recently talking about how bad alcohol abuse on campuses has gotten, and it linked blackout culture with the increase in assaults. So better drinking laws, especially for underage students, sounds like a good idea.Oh yeah, I am sure that plays a big role.  These kids are clearly way too young to be drinking, they need better enforcement of the lawsYeah. I think dry campuses are the way to go.

<s>OMG, this was absolutely heartbreaking.  What did you think of it?</s>I thought so tooI mean the horror the boy must have felt, and then the horror of the family, it's just crazyI know! like can you imagine turning your back for a second and losing your kid forever? Horrible.I can't even imagine, it's unthinkable.  I guess the well was in the yard?  Did it say?I think so, I know the boy was helping harvest vegetables. And the fact that they knew where he was and what happened but just couldn't reach him. So sad.Yeah, that is just terrible.  And how scared he must have been.His parents must have been so distressed too. I want to know more about the process of digging him out, like did they try to get some food to him? were they talking to him?Yeah that's what I was wondering!!  Did they try to get him provisions?  How did that all go?  The article didn't go into much detailNo, it was very vague. It sucks because digging probably went a lot slower with having to be careful about the stability of the ground.Yeah I bet so.  I can only imagine the pressure they felt.  Do you remember how far down it said he was?  WAs it like 400 ft?Gah, I can't remember. The only thing I remember that it was only one foot in diameter so that it was too narrow for adults.

Horrible.I can't even imagine, it's unthinkable.  I guess the well was in the yard?  Did it say?I think so, I know the boy was helping harvest vegetables. And the fact that they knew where he was and what happened but just couldn't reach him. So sad.Yeah, that is just terrible.  And how scared he must have been.His parents must have been so distressed too. I want to know more about the process of digging him out, like did they try to get some food to him? were they talking to him?Yeah that's what I was wondering!!  Did they try to get him provisions?  How did that all go?  The article didn't go into much detailNo, it was very vague. It sucks because digging probably went a lot slower with having to be careful about the stability of the ground.Yeah I bet so.  I can only imagine the pressure they felt.

I want to know more about the process of digging him out, like did they try to get some food to him? were they talking to him?Yeah that's what I was wondering!!  Did they try to get him provisions?  How did that all go?  The article didn't go into much detailNo, it was very vague. It sucks because digging probably went a lot slower with having to be careful about the stability of the ground.Yeah I bet so.  I can only imagine the pressure they felt.  Do you remember how far down it said he was?  WAs it like 400 ft?Gah, I can't remember. The only thing I remember that it was only one foot in diameter so that it was too narrow for adults.That is insane.  I am claustrophobic so just the thought of that induces panic.  That poor boy.It said he was three, right? or did it not mention his age? Oh my gosh I can't imagine his little face stop I'm gonna cryI do not remember seeing his age, but he must have been quite small to fit in a space that small.  Yeah no doubt, it is having the same effect on me.  I have four children and three are just babies, I am about to tear up too.  This is crazy.I can almost feel the panic of the parents, like the realization of what had happened and the frantic terror. Oh my gosh, goosebumps.Yeah seriously, like worst moment of their lives<s>I don't know what else to say! this was so sad, like I just want to send a huge frowny face and I wish I could hug his mom.</s>Yeah me too.

He just couldn't get him out due to how small it is.  Then they had to calculate where to stop digging.It obviously wasn't since they had 500 people searching for the boy before they started digging, but ok. How would you feel in the child's shoes? The families?I would be terrified if I was that little.   I just can't fathom what the little guy was thinking.   Did he scream - was he badly hurt - was he cold.  It's very disturbing to me being a parent.   I have to push those thoughts away.Yeah, they were a little sparse with the details. Was he killed on impact? Technically, they could have easily lowered food and water to him to keep him alive until he was unearthed. Perhaps he drowned?I don't know.  They were very sparse with the details.   Maybe that's the point - to see how we fill in the blanks.   I remember a similar case from Texas - they did rescue him though.It reminds me of that Simpson's episode.. Radio Bart I think it was, but with a much more tragic ending. Are your children similar in age to the child in the story?No - mine is gone but I do have 2 small grandchildren.Ah, well what are your biggest fears for the children in your family? I'm going to assume it isn't falling down wells.Agreed.   My biggest fear is they can't play outside by themselves for fear of someone driving by and taking them.   You can't let them walk or bike to a park.   Back in the day, that never crossed your mind at all.   They are both little girls so human trafficking is a nightmare to even entertain.I can't imagine. Yeah, when I was a kid we always stayed out until dusk just roaming around the neighborhood. I guess that isn't really a thing anymore.Exactly!   Played with other kids in other yards etc.   I feel they have missed an important part of being a kid.

Technically, they could have easily lowered food and water to him to keep him alive until he was unearthed. Perhaps he drowned?I don't know.  They were very sparse with the details.   Maybe that's the point - to see how we fill in the blanks.   I remember a similar case from Texas - they did rescue him though.It reminds me of that Simpson's episode.. Radio Bart I think it was, but with a much more tragic ending. Are your children similar in age to the child in the story?No - mine is gone but I do have 2 small grandchildren.Ah, well what are your biggest fears for the children in your family? I'm going to assume it isn't falling down wells.Agreed.   My biggest fear is they can't play outside by themselves for fear of someone driving by and taking them.   You can't let them walk or bike to a park.   Back in the day, that never crossed your mind at all.   They are both little girls so human trafficking is a nightmare to even entertain.<s>I can't imagine. Yeah, when I was a kid we always stayed out until dusk just roaming around the neighborhood. I guess that isn't really a thing anymore.</s>Exactly!   Played with other kids in other yards etc.   I feel they have missed an important part of being a kid.Do you think that the risk in modern America of such terrible things happening has actually increased, our anxiety has been exacerbated by the inundation of horrifying news stories or it's a combination of both?I do believe the level has increased.  I also think we see it in so many mediums 24/7.  That was not the case prior to the explosive growth of technology options.   Definitely with you on how our anxiety levels are heightened when you hear about it all the time.Have you ever been a part of a search party?I have not - have you?No, but once when I was visiting my great grandfather in Oklahoma my family got involved in a search for a young kid who had gone missing from his home. They found him but unfortunately he was hanging from a tree in a field. Apparently, he had had a fight with his father.Oh my!   Gave me cold chills reading that statement.   So many kids choosing to end their life.  We had one last year who jumped off a local bridge because of all the bullying on social media.   Parents have to get involved for this to stop.  Just take the account down.No kidding, that's horrible. Well, thanks for chatting with me today! Hope you have a nice afternoon. byegoodbye
You would think that the well on your property would be one of the first places that you looked.They did.  He fell while working with his father harvesting vegetables.  He just couldn't get him out due to how small it is.  Then they had to calculate where to stop digging.It obviously wasn't since they had 500 people searching for the boy before they started digging, but ok. How would you feel in the child's shoes?

<s>hey what were your takeaways with this article?</s>I have a hard time with pay comparisons by gender. I'm not denying that women on average probably make less, I'm just not sure it's a fair comparison.Yeah I have a mixedreaction it is sad less are in the work system as a wholeIt's not necessarily sad. My husband and I chose for me to be a stay at home mom and for him to work. That is what works for our family. I think we are lucky to be able to have one of us stay home.I guess, if that works happy there are thing like the stem programI really don't get what they say about that either, because while I was working, I had a job in science in genetics. At my work and at most of the other universities that we worked with, it seemed to be at least 50/50 men to women and I actually think more women.I don't now I don't have much experience with it but I know in college there were alot less females vs males in my science and math classesI think possibly there are more men who are engineers, but I think it's just not a career choice that many women make. If a women does get an engineering degree, she will probably have an easy time getting a job because there are so few women engineers and companies are always trying to add diversity.that is a great way to consider it maybe in the next generation there will be more and the next complaint is to many women in the fieldI just feel like sometimes men and women don't have to have equal representation in jobs. If a woman or a man wants to do a job that is traditionally only done by the other sex, I think they have every right to pursue that and shouldn't be discriminated against. But there are some jobs that most women or most men wouldn't be interested in. Like, I've never seen a female trash person. Most women just wouldn't be interested in that job.yeah very true the interest is usually why back when they were created it was divided im sure not much is stopping them from getting into a non traditional roleI'm sure worldwide, that there are places where women are discriminated against horribly. I can't imagine living in a place like that.

<s>How do you feel about gender equality in the U.S.?</s>I am very supportive.  I worked for 40 years and the things I experienced was astounding.  I have always thought - how can this be legal?   What about you?I was raised by my mother who worked two jobs to support my brother and I. The thought of her being paid less than a man in the same position really boils my potato.It should.  I ranked pretty high in my organization.  My entire career has been in banking.  I was so proud when I finally got promoted.    I was paid $60,000 and exceeded goals in all areas.  The guy that was in the same position and never met his goals was paid $135,000.   Why is it that continues to happen?Because discussing your salary has always been considered taboo in corporate culture, when in reality it should be openly discussed among employees to promote equality and fair wages for all workers.Too many guys out there that still thinks it is all unacceptable that we get the same pay.   Still that mentality of the good ole' boy network.   It's infuriating.Also, it's partly being locked into the "just world" fallacy. Lots of people believe that people are paid more simply because they work harder or are more effective.Wow you hit the nail on the head.    Was your mom paid fairly or given the opportunity to advance - gender set aside?No, she worked for the state and was offered "promotions" but her pay grade was the same and the workload was heavier. She now works for a non-profit and is the music leader at her church which she gets paid for. She seems much happier.Oh I am so happy for her!    You raised two great children and now doing something she loves.  US being so low on the pay inequality is astounding.  We are "suppose" to be the best.Thanks for the kind words.

How do you feel about gender equality in the U.S.?<s>I am very supportive.  I worked for 40 years and the things I experienced was astounding.  I have always thought - how can this be legal?   What about you?</s>I was raised by my mother who worked two jobs to support my brother and I. The thought of her being paid less than a man in the same position really boils my potato.It should.  I ranked pretty high in my organization.  My entire career has been in banking.  I was so proud when I finally got promoted.    I was paid $60,000 and exceeded goals in all areas.  The guy that was in the same position and never met his goals was paid $135,000.   Why is it that continues to happen?Because discussing your salary has always been considered taboo in corporate culture, when in reality it should be openly discussed among employees to promote equality and fair wages for all workers.Too many guys out there that still thinks it is all unacceptable that we get the same pay.

Lots of people believe that people are paid more simply because they work harder or are more effective.Wow you hit the nail on the head.

I am very supportive.  I worked for 40 years and the things I experienced was astounding.  I have always thought - how can this be legal?   What about you?I was raised by my mother who worked two jobs to support my brother and I. The thought of her being paid less than a man in the same position really boils my potato.It should.  I ranked pretty high in my organization.  My entire career has been in banking.  I was so proud when I finally got promoted.    I was paid $60,000 and exceeded goals in all areas.  The guy that was in the same position and never met his goals was paid $135,000.   Why is it that continues to happen?Because discussing your salary has always been considered taboo in corporate culture, when in reality it should be openly discussed among employees to promote equality and fair wages for all workers.Too many guys out there that still thinks it is all unacceptable that we get the same pay.   Still that mentality of the good ole' boy network.   It's infuriating.Also, it's partly being locked into the "just world" fallacy.

We recently had a huge thunderstorm and it was bigger than anything i've ever seen!I fear things are only going to get worst.It sucks that animals and wildlife have to suffer because of us.I agree. I think human greed is a huge problem.I wish i could donate or help the animals somehow.There are plenty of charities out there to donate to like the WWFI should definitely do that. Do you donate?<s>Yes, but I mainly donate to human causes.</s>That's still good. I remember seeing a picture of a duck with some plastic stuck to it's head, it was so sad.Or the turtles with straws in their noses.That sounds even worse. I am going to volunteer to clean up a beach one day.That cools, I may do that also.Great! It was nice talking to you. byeyou too bye

<s>How much longer do you think the ocean can keep taking one for the team?</s>Exactly what I was thinking, there is already so much trash in the ocean and this just adds to itNot to mention Japan dumping the nuclear waste from Fukushima into the Pacific recently.Are you kidding me? That's so disturbing, I lived in Fort Lauderdale at the time of the oil spill and I just remember seeing it floating at the top of the water and nobody was doing anything about itWe've literally turned the ocean into the worlds largest dump. Every time something like this happens we collectively shrug our shoulders and go "Oops!" then forget about it until the next horrible thing happens. I mean, what can you do?Yea exactly, there's no regulations to stop this stuff from happening. The owner of the tug boat in the article apologized and that was itDo you think there are practical steps that governments could take against this (and other) types of oil incidents?For the oil spill that happened 10 years ago i think they might require that whoever has the pipe in the water create a 2nd one so that the oil spill can be fixed in 3 days instead of 3 months.... but for the tug boat incident IDK what could be prevented other than using a different fuel than dieselI think it should absolutely be required that fail safes be in place before they begin drilling. I mean, it's not like these oil drilling outfits are strapped for cash or anything.yea its crazy that these fail safes aren't in place already, I mean that oil spill didn't even put BP out of businessWe can't move away from oil and gas soon enough. We're going to continue drawing it up until it's completely gone, but it would be nice to get to a place where we don't need it anymore to function.Yes that would be nice, I worry about what the world will be like for my childrens, children if we don't become more green and start taking better care of the planet

I mean, what can you do?Yea exactly, there's no regulations to stop this stuff from happening. The owner of the tug boat in the article apologized and that was itDo you think there are practical steps that governments could take against this (and other) types of oil incidents?For the oil spill that happened 10 years ago i think they might require that whoever has the pipe in the water create a 2nd one so that the oil spill can be fixed in 3 days instead of 3 months.... but for the tug boat incident IDK what could be prevented other than using a different fuel than dieselI think it should absolutely be required that fail safes be in place before they begin drilling. I mean, it's not like these oil drilling outfits are strapped for cash or anything.yea its crazy that these fail safes aren't in place already, I mean that oil spill didn't even put BP out of businessWe can't move away from oil and gas soon enough. We're going to continue drawing it up until it's completely gone, but it would be nice to get to a place where we don't need it anymore to function.Yes that would be nice, I worry about what the world will be like for my childrens, children if we don't become more green and start taking better care of the planet<s>I feel like the wheels are already in motion. I'm not trying to unfairly minimize the nobility of working toward a low energy future; because eventually people will have to, but the engine has too much inertia to be stopped now.</s>Yeah, which is a good thing, its necessary at this pointOur children's future will be marked by mass climate migrations, scarcity of water and legendary wildfires unfortunately, regardless of how we behave today.Yea and I don't think we can prevent some areas from going underwater at this pointAnd developers keep building in places that will literally be under water in a decade!Yea its wild, people are raising their houses in my area and the water its a few inches from the top of their dock, its sillyRidiculous.

<s>That was a lot of diesel to dump into the ocean.</s>i agree, what a waste and a danger to the wildlifeYes, the herring and abalone in the area sound like they're in trouble.i agree. i can imagine it would be difficult to clean upYes, I thought it was unfair to criticize the cleanup crew.  I'm sure they were doing their best.i agree, they are not to blameThat's the NDP government for you thoughi'm not too familiar with how things work up thereEither way, it sounds like conditions were very difficult for the cleanup.  And that's a pretty remote area.i wonder if they are still able to use the gas after they remove it fromthe waterYeah, that's an interesting question.  I really don't know.  That was a huge amount of diesel be carried by that tugboat though.definitely. best case is the marine life is saved and the fuel is saved too, lol

And that's a pretty remote area.i wonder if they are still able to use the gas after they remove it fromthe waterYeah, that's an interesting question.  I really don't know.  That was a huge amount of diesel be carried by that tugboat though.definitely. best case is the marine life is saved and the fuel is saved too, lolI know my dad loves pickled herring.  Hopefully this doesn't increase the price.  Not sure how much commercial fishing is done up there.<s>i'm not sure either, never been much of a seafood fan myself</s>I also wonder how much of the Indians' diet is from seafood.  Might be a meaningful amount, although they also probably get a lot of stuff flown or shipped in as well.i really dont know. hopefully it isnt a lingering problem in the areaYeah, that would be absolutely terrible.

<s>Hello, what did you think about the article?</s>I thought it was sad. :( I've heard plenty about the opioid crisis, but not in relation to kids before.Yeah seriously! The parents need to be more responsibleYeah, though it's hard to fault them. Children are naturally curious and it only takes you forgetting one time to lead to disaster.It's so sad because these children had their whole lives ahead of them!It's especially sad because they would have had no concept that what they're doing would be a problem. They probably just thought it was candy or something.Exactly. I'm not sure if you can even prevent thisYeah. It mentioned that the kids are figuring out how to open the bottles 鈥?maybe better child proofing should be looked in to?That's a great idea. Do you have children of your own?Not personally, no, but I used to nanny for several different families so I'm well aware of the trouble they can get themselves into, haha. You?I don't but i can't even imagine the horror the parents must have felt when they arrived home and saw what happpened with their childYeah. :( All it takes is a split second of inattention 鈥?and no one can pay attention /all/ the time 鈥?and bam. :(

The statistics in America for opioid overdose are horrible and they've been climbing every year. From what I understand the biggest issue is in doctors just over prescribing and then people get addicted largely by accident.

Hopefully they were all treated well.Let's hope things improve in the future for both humans and animals. It was nice talking to you! byeYes, it was nice talking to you.  Have a nice day.  bye
I would say at least a couple years in jail! The fact that you can just go up to an animal and slam it to the ground sounds.. disturbingFor sure.  I also wonder how/why they thought they'd get away with it.  There must have been a lot of people around.Yeah! Exactly. It's sad how not only are we destroying the homes of animals but now we're abusing them as wellYes, whether it's as a species or as individuals, we tend to be pretty destructive, even sadistic at times.I don't think it's ever going to change sadly.I tend to agree.  I think it's part of our makeup.  We'll always keep striving for dominance and control, over each other and nature.True. I saw a video of people abusing elephants and it made me want to cryYeah, that's terrible.  Again, I just don't understand it.  Does it make people feel powerful or tough or something?  Or maybe they're just sadists.I think sadists or just the fact that they think animals are just a .. thing, with no emotionsFor sure.  I'm sure that's part of it.  I bet the zookeepers at the Busch Gardens are absolutely distraught.  I'm sure they develop close bonds with all those animals.Definitely.

<s>what did you think about the article?</s>My first impression is what is wrong with people.   Why would you pick it up and then throw it down to the ground?   If you hurt animals, something is really off.   What about your?Exactly. Imagine having that cold of a heart that you kill a harmless animal in that manner.I am a firm believer that if you do hurt animals you are either a psychopath or sociopath.    I wonder if the story was true about Pinky?I think its a real story. Witnesses said that he picked up a different flamingo but put it down before getting the other one.I wonder what was different in his mind on the second flamingo?it was probably smallerI wish they had included the video of Pinky dancing :)pinky was already 19 years old thats sadIt is.   I have no idea what the life span is of a flamingo?   Do you?no idea eitherEven though it was a horrendous act, I do not see jailing someone.   He should have had to do a lot of community service and pay a hefty fine.  Thoughts?

<s>hey were you as sad as me about whats going on</s>Yeah. I think we tend to forget how important water is in the US (or at least some parts), but wow.yeah when animals thrive on it and people need those animals it can ruin alotYeah.

And the one that was like 98% gone, I forget the species, but yikes.such large numbers you think more would be deing done to helpYeah. It sounds like the governments didn't handle it well at all.they probably dont have enough money or resourcesI mean, the article made it seems like the two governments took responsibility for it, so. It seems like the way water was divided between Paraguay and Argentina was partially responsible for the discrepancy.yeah but they said if its not figired out soon this will happen for years to come how scaryTrue. And with the replenishing season not coming until January, that's a long wait.

<s>I think climate change is going effect us all very soon.</s>I don't know if it is or isn't, but this seems to be effecting the population of wildlife in this area right now.

The climate has obviously changed a lot over the time the earth has existed. I don't know how much of climate changes is due to people or to natural changes.Yeah that is a real debate, I think it is man caused like the river issues in this story.I think in this situation, they are obviously having  a drought this season.

This is similair to how with war we think killing everyone is going to solve the problem but it won't. it's a facade to look like were doing something good when it is actually not helping at all.

It was nice talking to you! bye<s>ok, bye</s>

<s>I wasn't aware that only three species of mammal can carry leprosy.</s>I agree . Astonishing that leprosy still affectrs 385,000 people around the world still.No kidding!

Do you live in an area with populations of armadillos?not really, do you?Actually, yes.

Also, most representations of the disease in the media are flagrantly misleading.The media seems to always mislead usYou certainly don't see a lot of credible documentaries on most media outlets. Do you live in an area with populations of armadillos?not really, do you?Actually, yes. They have been moving northward due to changing temperatures in the south and it's not uncommon to see them on roadways. They're cute but now i'm inclined to keep my distance.what's wrong with armadillos? I'm clueless about them.They carry leprosy that can be transferred to humans according to the article.<s>According to the article. there is no evidence of squirrel to human transmission so thats a good thing</s>Yeah, it's a shame that the species of squirrel that has been found to carry the disease is also endangered.It's crazy how Leprosy has been known since biblical times lolRight? All this time and we still haven't found a cure. Apparently, it also goes by the name of Hansen's disease. Did you know there are leper colonies in Hawaii?did not know that.Yep, and apparently one of the biggest risk factors for contracting leprosy is living in poverty. There's still plenty of that to go around.you really have to take care of yourself with all these diseases going around.Have you ever had first hand experience with a serious illness?not really. I have family members with diabetes and high blood pressure that's the most. what about you?I've dealt with food poisoning on a couple of different occasions, but nothing I would label as "serious."

<s>Airstrikes on civilians are always the worst. :(</s>Yeah, this is pretty heartbreaking to read.  Such a terrible situation without any real valid solution in sight.Yeah. It reminded me of when the independent candidate for pres in 2016 asked "What's Aleppo?". To quote this article, Not Pompeii. :/What moron made that statement?  But yeah, that is really sad.  And the whole area is just constantly in violent conflict it seems.Yeah. 300 people in just a handful of days... that's awful.Yeah that is outrageous.  I guess it is these terrorist groups that are causing all this?If I recall correctly it was rebels vs the syrian government, but I could be wrong.You are probably right, who are these rebels, though?I think it was Shiite Muslims who disagreed with the way Syria was being run (Syria is mostly Sunni Muslims). The Syrian government is not known for its care of people.Oh ok, that makes sense.  I think I hae read the same thing.  Regardless, it doesn't matter to the victims of these tragedies.  It's very unfair to them.Agreed. Especially when there's kids involved.Yeah exactly that was really the worst part of all.

<s>Hey there, what did you think of the article?</s>I just hate it so much when civilians, who had nothing to do with the conflict and were minding their own business, get targeted like this :(Exactly! And to think of the families they left behind as wellLike, I can't imagine finding out my mom was literally just in the house doing chores or whatever and then... gone.It's terrifying. I think i would go in to severe depressionYeah. The fact that it was during what was supposed to be a cease fire is even worse.I'm not sure if it was in the article, but i hope no children were harmed!I think they just said thirteen civilians, didn't mention age. But when kids are involved they usually say so, I think.That's good. I read an article this morning about innocent civilians being killed..and there were babies involvedOh no that's awful. :(Yeah it was sad to read. I hope the families of the lost ones will be able to live a happy life in the futureHard to do that, unfortunately, when like in this case neither side seems willing to budge even a bit.

<s>Fighting over Kashmir has been going on for decades and doesn't seem to be ending soon.</s>Yeah I remember hearing stories about them fighting a long time ago.They're both nuclear powers so that makes the tensions more meaningful, though they've refrained from using nuclear weapons to this point.Do you think India should face consequences for what they did?I guess I feel like I don't know enough about the back-and-forth.

And I'm sure there are plenty of radical folks who would like to actively fight India.do you think there will be another was between the two?I'm sure there will continue to be skirmishes like this.  But an all-out war between these two countries would be massive, with the potential for nuclear strikes.  I doubt we'll see something like that in our lifetime.I wouldn't doubt anything anymore to be honest after seeing somebody like Donald Trump getting elected.

<s>This particular article was really trying to pull on the heartstrings.</s>Yes, it was a pretty grisly image it portrayed of what happened to the kitten.Yeah, the amount of detail and effort put into trying to encourage the reader to vicariously live out the last moments of its life was a little off putting.Yeah, they were clearly trying to influence people to join their cause for justice and animal equality.That tactic is used by a lot of animal rights groups and frankly, it has the opposite effect on me personally. I'm a human being who is capable of empathy, you don't have to shove it down my throat.Yeah, and I feel they're too quick to judge in instances like this.  Maybe the kitten was way into BDSM.  Maybe it died feeling unimaginable ecstasy.  Like, let's not rush to judgment here.Or, maybe it was dead before it was wrapped in utility cords and abandoned. There just a lot of cruelty read into a situation without any proof.For sure.  I do think they also lose credibility when they talk about things like animal "equality."  Opposing cruelty is one thing, but talking about equality for all living things?  So if I swat a fly am I going to be charged with murder?  Let's get realistic or else your whole argument loses credibility.I mean, Jainists take care not to harm any other living thing. They carry brooms wherever they go to sweep any insects out of their path, but most people crusading for animal rights aren't Jains, they drive cars and eat factory farmed food. I think people just like something to be outraged about; gives them purpose in a reality characterized by globalized exploitation and loss of meaning.Yeah, people sure like being outraged nowadays.  It's like they prefer it.  They want to be victims of something, or see someone as a victim.Or blame their problems on someone else instead of looking inward and making changes to their personality and lifestyle. Being outraged is just so much easier! Bonus! It allows me to vent the frustrations of my daily life that most likely have nothing to do with what I'm outraged about!Absolutely.  Back to the article for a second, I wonder what the penalties are for animal cruelty cases.  I assume it's just fines but I don't know.  Do you have any idea?

You can be arrested but bond is normally set really low, ~2000 for even the most heinous acts. It's equivalent to a severe moving violation in your vehicle.

I'm a human being who is capable of empathy, you don't have to shove it down my throat.Yeah, and I feel they're too quick to judge in instances like this.  Maybe the kitten was way into BDSM.  Maybe it died feeling unimaginable ecstasy.  Like, let's not rush to judgment here.<s>Or, maybe it was dead before it was wrapped in utility cords and abandoned. There just a lot of cruelty read into a situation without any proof.</s>For sure.  I do think they also lose credibility when they talk about things like animal "equality."  Opposing cruelty is one thing, but talking about equality for all living things?  So if I swat a fly am I going to be charged with murder?  Let's get realistic or else your whole argument loses credibility.I mean, Jainists take care not to harm any other living thing. They carry brooms wherever they go to sweep any insects out of their path, but most people crusading for animal rights aren't Jains, they drive cars and eat factory farmed food. I think people just like something to be outraged about; gives them purpose in a reality characterized by globalized exploitation and loss of meaning.Yeah, people sure like being outraged nowadays.  It's like they prefer it.  They want to be victims of something, or see someone as a victim.Or blame their problems on someone else instead of looking inward and making changes to their personality and lifestyle. Being outraged is just so much easier! Bonus! It allows me to vent the frustrations of my daily life that most likely have nothing to do with what I'm outraged about!Absolutely.  Back to the article for a second, I wonder what the penalties are for animal cruelty cases.  I assume it's just fines but I don't know.  Do you have any idea?Usually fines. You can be arrested but bond is normally set really low, ~2000 for even the most heinous acts. It's equivalent to a severe moving violation in your vehicle.Yeah, I figured it would be something like that.  In this case it would be interesting to see if the citizens track down the culprit.Supremely doubtful, it's not like they have the help of law enforcement or anything. They are basically going vigilante in the hopes of solving a case with no evidence or power to investigate.I suppose it depends on where the kitten came from.  If someone had a litter and gave them away it could be found out.  Either way I don't really care.That's the long and short of it right? Wouldn't the time be better spent fostering living pets or something similar?I agree.  I feel sad at the thought of a tortured cat.  But I'm not going to lose sleep over a dead cat, just like I don't break down when I see a squirrel squished on the road.

Wouldn't the time be better spent fostering living pets or something similar?</s>I agree.  I feel sad at the thought of a tortured cat.  But I'm not going to lose sleep over a dead cat, just like I don't break down when I see a squirrel squished on the road.There are certainly more personal and pressing things to lose sleep over.

Or, maybe it was dead before it was wrapped in utility cords and abandoned. There just a lot of cruelty read into a situation without any proof.For sure.  I do think they also lose credibility when they talk about things like animal "equality."  Opposing cruelty is one thing, but talking about equality for all living things?  So if I swat a fly am I going to be charged with murder?  Let's get realistic or else your whole argument loses credibility.I mean, Jainists take care not to harm any other living thing. They carry brooms wherever they go to sweep any insects out of their path, but most people crusading for animal rights aren't Jains, they drive cars and eat factory farmed food. I think people just like something to be outraged about; gives them purpose in a reality characterized by globalized exploitation and loss of meaning.Yeah, people sure like being outraged nowadays.  It's like they prefer it.  They want to be victims of something, or see someone as a victim.Or blame their problems on someone else instead of looking inward and making changes to their personality and lifestyle. Being outraged is just so much easier! Bonus! It allows me to vent the frustrations of my daily life that most likely have nothing to do with what I'm outraged about!Absolutely.  Back to the article for a second, I wonder what the penalties are for animal cruelty cases.  I assume it's just fines but I don't know.  Do you have any idea?Usually fines. You can be arrested but bond is normally set really low, ~2000 for even the most heinous acts. It's equivalent to a severe moving violation in your vehicle.Yeah, I figured it would be something like that.

<s>How do you feel about cops punching women?</s>I kinda have mixed feelings about this situation.  I think there is more to this story than we have been told.  I don't think cops should punch anyone, but it did say she was trying to punch and kick him and it might have been his first reaction.  If she's going to act like a man, then what does she expect?  It's still unprofessional of him though, that's for sure.  What did you think?I think cops should be able to use the force they deem appropriate.  This woman was clearly resisting arrest.  She should have cooperated.  It's not hard not to get punched in the face by a cop.Yeah, I agree.  People act like animals around cops and then get all shocked and offended when the cops retaliate.  It is ridiculous in my opinion.  She's now sued the city for 1 million dollars, by the way, I saw when I googled this.That annoys the hell outta me.  Yeah, I still don't understand why that isn't the first question asked in any of these situations.  "Well, were they complying with the officer's instructions or not?"  Why we have so many people who don't feel they need to respect the authority of law enforcement is beyond me.  It's for everyone's safety.Good, I am so glad we are on the same page.  I was worried I would be stuck talking to someone who was defending this woman.  I do not have any sympathy for her.  If she had just complied with what he said, none of this would have happened.  She still could have gotten her issue straightened out ultimately.Yeah, I agree completely.  Believe me, I don't have sympathy for these people.  I have amazing respect for the police and am amazed that they don't hurt people more often.  Dealing with non-compliant riffraff would absolutely infuriate me.Me too, they have an incredibly difficult job and the public does not give them the support they deserve.  In so many of these cases that get national attention, the person seen as the "victim" was acting up, resisting the officer, being defiant, and totally causing their own problemsAbsolutely.  Not only that, but how many thousands, or tens of thousands or incidents go off completely professionally and without incident, for every one we see where someone gets shot or assaulted.  But we only focus on the few bad events and create a narrative that people are routinely abused or even targeted by cops.yeah exactly, and the police are made out to be these villainous brutal people who take advantage of othersImagine what society would be like without police.  We sure take them for granted and expect them to put their own lives in danger while not harming a fly.Yeah, and all the mess they put up with everyday, just people disrespecting them and resisting them and being general pains in the neck

I might not like getting pulled over for a speeding ticket, but at the end of the day I know they're in the right and I'm in the wrong.  So, I suck it up.Yeah, I feel I've always been treated fairly by the police.  And when I treat them with respect, they reciprocate.  It's not rocket science.Same here, I've been annoyed before but I've always been treated fairly and with decent courtesy.Well, I sure hope that lady doesn't win her lawsuit.  That would set an awful precedent.Yes I totally agree.  You know she's sitting at home just laughing it up.  She punched and kicked a cop, acted disrespectful, and then gets paid.
How do you feel about cops punching women?I kinda have mixed feelings about this situation.  I think there is more to this story than we have been told.  I don't think cops should punch anyone, but it did say she was trying to punch and kick him and it might have been his first reaction.  If she's going to act like a man, then what does she expect?  It's still unprofessional of him though, that's for sure.  What did you think?I think cops should be able to use the force they deem appropriate.  This woman was clearly resisting arrest.  She should have cooperated.  It's not hard not to get punched in the face by a cop.Yeah, I agree.  People act like animals around cops and then get all shocked and offended when the cops retaliate.  It is ridiculous in my opinion.  She's now sued the city for 1 million dollars, by the way, I saw when I googled this.That annoys the hell outta me.  Yeah, I still don't understand why that isn't the first question asked in any of these situations.  "Well, were they complying with the officer's instructions or not?"  Why we have so many people who don't feel they need to respect the authority of law enforcement is beyond me.  It's for everyone's safety.Good, I am so glad we are on the same page.  I was worried I would be stuck talking to someone who was defending this woman.  I do not have any sympathy for her.  If she had just complied with what he said, none of this would have happened.  She still could have gotten her issue straightened out ultimately.Yeah, I agree completely.  Believe me, I don't have sympathy for these people.  I have amazing respect for the police and am amazed that they don't hurt people more often.  Dealing with non-compliant riffraff would absolutely infuriate me.<s>Me too, they have an incredibly difficult job and the public does not give them the support they deserve.  In so many of these cases that get national attention, the person seen as the "victim" was acting up, resisting the officer, being defiant, and totally causing their own problems</s>Absolutely.  Not only that, but how many thousands, or tens of thousands or incidents go off completely professionally and without incident, for every one we see where someone gets shot or assaulted.  But we only focus on the few bad events and create a narrative that people are routinely abused or even targeted by cops.yeah exactly, and the police are made out to be these villainous brutal people who take advantage of othersImagine what society would be like without police.

That would set an awful precedent.Yes I totally agree.  You know she's sitting at home just laughing it up.  She punched and kicked a cop, acted disrespectful, and then gets paid.Yeah, it's awful.  But we seem to encourage, reward, and even seek victimhood in our society today.  It's pitiful.Yep, we sure do.  You said it better than I.  Well I must go, hope you have a great day.  goodbyeYeah, have a great day.  Nice chatting with you.  goodbye
Good, I am so glad we are on the same page.  I was worried I would be stuck talking to someone who was defending this woman.  I do not have any sympathy for her.  If she had just complied with what he said, none of this would have happened.  She still could have gotten her issue straightened out ultimately.Yeah, I agree completely.  Believe me, I don't have sympathy for these people.  I have amazing respect for the police and am amazed that they don't hurt people more often.  Dealing with non-compliant riffraff would absolutely infuriate me.Me too, they have an incredibly difficult job and the public does not give them the support they deserve.  In so many of these cases that get national attention, the person seen as the "victim" was acting up, resisting the officer, being defiant, and totally causing their own problemsAbsolutely.  Not only that, but how many thousands, or tens of thousands or incidents go off completely professionally and without incident, for every one we see where someone gets shot or assaulted.  But we only focus on the few bad events and create a narrative that people are routinely abused or even targeted by cops.yeah exactly, and the police are made out to be these villainous brutal people who take advantage of othersImagine what society would be like without police.  We sure take them for granted and expect them to put their own lives in danger while not harming a fly.Yeah, and all the mess they put up with everyday, just people disrespecting them and resisting them and being general pains in the neckYeah, again, I'd just lose my mind.  Like, watching high-speed chases pisses me off.  I'd get out of the car and just shoot the person.Yeah people are just so disrespectful and ungrateful really.  It is disheartening.  I might not like getting pulled over for a speeding ticket, but at the end of the day I know they're in the right and I'm in the wrong.  So, I suck it up.Yeah, I feel I've always been treated fairly by the police.  And when I treat them with respect, they reciprocate.

<s>Seems like a tragic accident or misunderstanding.</s>Yea that is what it seems like, not exactly sure how that happened but its sad that it had to escalate to thatDefinitely.  I can't imagine what was going through the minds of the Americans not stopping at the gate.Yea, the other soldiers must of been quick to shoot, it just seems so crazy \It seems more tragic when soldiers die from friendly fire, but I guess the result is the same.Yea because the American soldiers were going there to help train themThe families must be distraught.  I'm sure they thought their solider family members were safe just doing training.Yea definitely, since they were just going to help Jordan out and get killed doing it. I looked into the case via WIKI and the guard that killed them got life in prisonWow, interesting.  Any idea what his motivation was?The FBI looked into it to see if it was religious extremism and/or ISIS but they didn't find anything like that. Through the footage though it looked deliberate, and the americans in the cars had no weapons to defend themselvesWow, that's sad.  I know stuff like that goes on.  I knew a girl in college whose brother was murdered by some of his troop mates in the Army.  That was a pretty awful revelation for them to have to face.Wow, that is terrible to be killed by your own troop mates. I have 2 sons and would never let them join the army, so much mental illness in the military unfortunately.

I feel like I've only met 1 or 2 people that got a ton out of it, but I guess it really depends on what are you live in. Where I am from not a lot of people join the militaryIt definitely depends on your service and your job.  I've known a lot of Navy guys who were officers and that's different from say enlisted Marines or Army.What's the difference?Well, in terms of officer and enlisted the difference is socio-economic.  In terms of service there are just different attitudes and personality types.
Seems like a tragic accident or misunderstanding.Yea that is what it seems like, not exactly sure how that happened but its sad that it had to escalate to thatDefinitely.  I can't imagine what was going through the minds of the Americans not stopping at the gate.Yea, the other soldiers must of been quick to shoot, it just seems so crazy \It seems more tragic when soldiers die from friendly fire, but I guess the result is the same.Yea because the American soldiers were going there to help train them<s>The families must be distraught.  I'm sure they thought their solider family members were safe just doing training.</s>Yea definitely, since they were just going to help Jordan out and get killed doing it. I looked into the case via WIKI and the guard that killed them got life in prisonWow, interesting.  Any idea what his motivation was?The FBI looked into it to see if it was religious extremism and/or ISIS but they didn't find anything like that. Through the footage though it looked deliberate, and the americans in the cars had no weapons to defend themselvesWow, that's sad.  I know stuff like that goes on.  I knew a girl in college whose brother was murdered by some of his troop mates in the Army.  That was a pretty awful revelation for them to have to face.Wow, that is terrible to be killed by your own troop mates.

Anyway, all of them can be dangerous, like these guys found out, unfortunately.

I feel like I've only met 1 or 2 people that got a ton out of it, but I guess it really depends on what are you live in. Where I am from not a lot of people join the militaryIt definitely depends on your service and your job.  I've known a lot of Navy guys who were officers and that's different from say enlisted Marines or Army.What's the difference?Well, in terms of officer and enlisted the difference is socio-economic.  In terms of service there are just different attitudes and personality types.Oh gotcha, I've known 2 people from the air force that did well afterwards and 1 guy from the marines that had a really hard go afterwards... but def different personality types<s>Yeah, I could certainly see that.  Air Force and Navy are sort of more "office jobs" and skilled professions (like mechanics).  Marines and Army are a lot more "military military" if you know what I mean.  Anyway, all of them can be dangerous, like these guys found out, unfortunately.</s>Yeah, I am sure the guy that shot them did it on purpose. I was reading that Jordan would get weapons from the US and then sell them on the black market, so probably not the best ally to haveThat's too bad.  Not a lot of people we can apparently trust in the Middle East.  Oh well, nuke 'em all.  Nice chatting with you.  byehaha bye
Wow, interesting.  Any idea what his motivation was?The FBI looked into it to see if it was religious extremism and/or ISIS but they didn't find anything like that. Through the footage though it looked deliberate, and the americans in the cars had no weapons to defend themselvesWow, that's sad.  I know stuff like that goes on.  I knew a girl in college whose brother was murdered by some of his troop mates in the Army.  That was a pretty awful revelation for them to have to face.Wow, that is terrible to be killed by your own troop mates.

Everyone loves to blame Trump for everything.  There have been hate crimes against Jews since the beginning of time.  That is nothing new.I know they secretly love Trump though they won't admit it through the media networks that they ownThe polls spoke for themselves.  Jewish people supported Trump more than they have other Republican candidates in the past.  Really, it's articles like this that perpetuate this whole finger pointing deal towards Trump.  It's stupid.Exactly Trump has done more for Israel then any other I mean we all know America is basically run by Israel but now its so much more open with itSeriously, people always fail to recognize these things.  Probably because they just read CNN and disregard actual facts.  Oh well, what can you doyou can only educate yourself you cant change anyones mind you can only make them thinkYep, that is very very true.  Pretty much everyone I know feels the same way I do though so there's no one's mind to changeyea me too I live in a rural place not the city cesspoolsSame here, conservative rural area.  I couldn't stand living in a big city.I grew up in the city and got the hell out first chance i gotI do not blame you.  I grew up in a mid-sized city and it was bad enough, we've been so much happier since we moved out here.<s>yep got a little fixer upper with 6 acres now I have my livestock and chickens</s>Wow, that is great!

<s>How did this article make you feel?</s>I was surprised because I did not know the Jewish community felt like that and you?Not really.

What did you feel about the article?To be honest, I am so tired of listening to or reading anything about politicsYes, it's pretty draining.  I think people would find the world is not quite as oppressive and dangerous as it seems on TV or online if they'd live in the real version of it.  Not to say there aren't serious problems, but the online version is much worse from my experience.It's all sensationalism.   Clintons, Bush's, Obama, and now Trump.   America will never heal because it's all about me, me, me and whatever opinion spews out of the National Media.  Some believe it all.Yes, it's problematic.  I believe the polarization will continue--hard to see how it gets better.

Yes, the suicide stats are a pretty shocking indictment of social media.  I mean, what else can be the cause?  That's what's fundamentally changed our culture in the last decade.Agreed.  Eventually past my lifetime the world is going to be run by machines and millions of people hungry because there aren't enough jobs.Yes, that's going to be interesting.  What do we do when 50% (or more) of the people in the country are unemployable because of A.I.?  Our economy will presumably have to fundamentally change.  I hope I'm dead before then.Me too.  I worry so much for all the children.   So much for them to overcome for debt, etc.Yes, and they're emotionally set up to struggle to deal with it.  The real problems become far worse because of the anxiety and toxic online environment and all that stuff.  It makes me exhausted to deal with it and I'm old and grumpy and don't care.Well we sound about the same age.   Parents just do everything for the kids today and they know nothing about the world because of it.Yes, I think it's sad that parents think they're doing the right thing by sheltering their children from hardship, when that's really what they need to become strong.  Science is verifying this fact: coddling only makes people LESS capable of dealing with problems.Exactly - that shift took place after my daughter was in her 20s.   I watch her raise my two granddaughters.   She's a bit of a helicopter parent as well but she does at least teach them how to react to bullies, fend for themselves, aspire to be something great, but I feel she's missing the boat on household responsibilities.I guess we all (if we live long enough) have to go through that phase where the world changes and becomes something different from what we've known.  It just seems to be happening faster now, and we're far more aware of it because we know what everyone is doing all the time now.Young people live their life online - every moment documented - it portrays a life that don't live and hurts those that are absent from their postings.   It will be interesting to see it either shift away or continue its destructive pathYes, I agree.  You'd think that at some point self-preservation would kick in and people would recognize the destruction they're doing to themselves and others.  But I think it's a real addiction, or enough of one that simple reason might not rule the day.  It isn't right now.  It's worrisome, but I guess I take solace in the fact that at some point I'll be dead.  On that cheery note, it's been nice chatting with you.

It was the most boring accident ever.

i agree something this is the second huge crashIt makes me a bit apprehensive about taking transit like that, and I was already a little wary of it.same with little control of the outcomeHave you ever been involved in a transportation accident like that?no thank god we dont really have trains around hereI haven't either, though one time I was on a city bus and it took a turn too sharp and hit a light pole. It was the most boring accident ever.wow haha thats just silly i guess it was like that but way faster !Another bus came and everyone just transferred over like nothing happened.well that sounds like an easy fix luckyYep. Trains are weird things though, with the tracks and all. It seems like things have to be pretty exact for everything to go smoothly.yeah there pretty routine i wonder if they will investigate more<s>I'm sure they probably will. They probably need the investigation for insurance purposes.</s>oh that is true need to stop the pattern of it happeningReally, I think trains are one of the safer ways to travel. I don't know the exact statistics right now, but I think they were right after planes in safeness.i can see that maybe the technology just needs to be updatedMaybe convert them all to MagLev trains. I haven't heard anything about those crashing.i have never heard of those thats interestingThey kind of float on magnets, so there's very little friction.

<s>what did you think about the article?</s>It was sad time all the people that was lostyeah its the same spot a crash happened in 2013 as well.I didn't know that what was that crash aboutat least only four died couldve been worseyeah i hate stories like this such a tragic event to lose someone.I always wonder though if someone was inept at their job when these things happenI know i heard one crash happen cause the train conduter was under the influence of drugs. I just wish people could not do that with other peoples lives.I remember about a train crash in Japan where the driver was just so scared of losing his job because his bosses were so strict and yelled at them for anything that he lost control of a train and many people died.Wow that crazy i know we all love our jobs but these bosses should be fired they killed lots of people doing this.yeah its sadHumans is slowly killing each other this way.One day they be just robots doing these train jobs even know they can screw up but not this badly i don't think.

I know that trains are safe to travel in, but this makes me pause.I seem to hear more stories about train crashes than I do about plane crashes.

<s>What a tragedy!</s>Yes, it seems like it would be terrifying to be in a train derailment.Yes no doubt. And I feel terrible for the victims' familiesFor sure.  I always think of trains as very safe modes of transportation.  It would be shocking to hear a loved one died on a train.I know, theyre regarded as being so safe and then somethig like the happens unexpectedly.I'm always puzzled about how derailments can occur.  Do the trains go too fast or are the tracks damaged or something?  I never understand it.I would think that the tracks would be better maintained. But I guess you cant plan for every possible problemHave you ever been on a long train ride?  I've only ever been on subways and light rail.I have not. Just subways for me. They scare me more than a train would.haha! What it is about the subway that scares you?  Being underground?Yes I think the underground aspect gives me a bit of claustrophobia. My city doesnt have subways so it isnt something Im accustomed to.Gotcha.  I can definitely see that.  They're also usually very dark and often extremely crowded.  I rode one to work for a few years.  Wasn't the best part of my day.

Yes, it seems like it would be terrifying to be in a train derailment.Yes no doubt. And I feel terrible for the victims' familiesFor sure.  I always think of trains as very safe modes of transportation.  It would be shocking to hear a loved one died on a train.I know, theyre regarded as being so safe and then somethig like the happens unexpectedly.I'm always puzzled about how derailments can occur.  Do the trains go too fast or are the tracks damaged or something?  I never understand it.I would think that the tracks would be better maintained. But I guess you cant plan for every possible problemHave you ever been on a long train ride?  I've only ever been on subways and light rail.I have not. Just subways for me. They scare me more than a train would.haha! What it is about the subway that scares you?  Being underground?Yes I think the underground aspect gives me a bit of claustrophobia. My city doesnt have subways so it isnt something Im accustomed to.Gotcha.  I can definitely see that.  They're also usually very dark and often extremely crowded.  I rode one to work for a few years.

<s>Do you think people should kill themselves?</s>I would prefer that people not feel the need to kill themselves.  That would be my hope for people.

I can't recall the details about him.   Was he eventually found guilty of something equivalent to murder?  I don't recall. He was convicted of second-degree murder and served 8 years of a 10-to-25-year prison sentence.I'll have to go back and read about him.  Seems strange that he thought he could get away with doing that.  But maybe I don't remember the specifics of what he did and what the laws were.

I can't recall the details about him.   Was he eventually found guilty of something equivalent to murder?  I don't recall. He was convicted of second-degree murder and served 8 years of a 10-to-25-year prison sentence.I'll have to go back and read about him.

And if I were in his situation I certainly wouldn't have thought I could get away with it, even if he just felt he was enabling others to commit suicide.  But obviously he felt more passionately about it than I do.Have had it family members or friends that had a really prolonged illness?Umm, yes and no, I guess.  Like, I've had family members waste away in hospital beds for years.  One with Alzheimer's.  But nothing where I thought, "Man, this person needs to be put out of their misery."  I've always thought life was misery.  But you stay 'til the credits.I think when a person loses the joy of life and there is nothing but pain, it should be their choice.I don't look down on people who commit suicide.  I understand the desire to die.  I don't think it's "cowardly" or anything like that.  Is it selfish?  Sure, but so is wanting people to continue to suffer for our own sake.  But I personally don't think the state should be encouraging it in any way.
Do you think people should kill themselves?I would prefer that people not feel the need to kill themselves.  That would be my hope for people.

It's just not an issue we hear much about here.  Suicide talk nowadays tends to focus on young people, which has apparently spiked.I grow up in Michigan and remember the big fuss over doctor KevorkianYeah, I totally forgot about him.  I can't recall the details about him.   Was he eventually found guilty of something equivalent to murder?  I don't recall. He was convicted of second-degree murder and served 8 years of a 10-to-25-year prison sentence.I'll have to go back and read about him.  Seems strange that he thought he could get away with doing that.  But maybe I don't remember the specifics of what he did and what the laws were.He tried to push the law for something he thought was right. I don't blame him, but I do understand why it is a complex issue.Yeah, it's certainly a complicated issue.  And if I were in his situation I certainly wouldn't have thought I could get away with it, even if he just felt he was enabling others to commit suicide.  But obviously he felt more passionately about it than I do.Have had it family members or friends that had a really prolonged illness?Umm, yes and no, I guess.  Like, I've had family members waste away in hospital beds for years.  One with Alzheimer's.  But nothing where I thought, "Man, this person needs to be put out of their misery."  I've always thought life was misery.  But you stay 'til the credits.<s>I think when a person loses the joy of life and there is nothing but pain, it should be their choice.</s>I don't look down on people who commit suicide.  I understand the desire to die.  I don't think it's "cowardly" or anything like that.  Is it selfish?  Sure, but so is wanting people to continue to suffer for our own sake.  But I personally don't think the state should be encouraging it in any way.Not encouraging it, but not making it that they have to use a gun or hang themselvesYeah, I understand that side of it.  Give them a place to do it "safely" (a bit of a misnomer, but whatever).  But I still don't agree with the tacit validation of it.  Just my opinion.I do not fault you for your opinion. It is great to see how other people feel about different topics.Yeah, I always find it interesting.  I think people actually have the same values; they just weigh them differently in different situations.  What we're talking about is largely a conflict between freedom and order (maybe not the best word for it, but I'll use it anyway).  I believe in freedom of choice.  So do you and everyone.  You believe in order and stability, just like I and everyone else does.  But in some cases I prefer order over security and stability, or vice versa.  Many of our controversial issues boil down to that.  It's unfortunate that people can't see that underneath it all we actually share the same basic values.I can agree with that.

<s>Well, this article was a little vague and confusing.</s>I thought that it was very vague. It doesn't even give a back story but i feel bad for hte policeWhy do you feel bad for the police?I read the article a while ago, but didnt it mention a police getting killed?No, the article I read only mentioned one 70 year old man and the shooter being dead. Then, it looped back around and said the shooter was still barricaded in his house at the end.That's weird. Although mine did mention the shooter barricaded in the house. It was a weirdly worded article overall. Do you think the police are too aggressive?I think that police are trained to be aggressive in both speech and action, but only listening/watching media outlets will give you a very biased view of the situation. You?I agree. There's definitely bad police out there but only the bad ones are shown on media outlets like you said. The other 80% don't get creditI mean, I think there's something to be said for the so called "good cops" who are passively complicit in all the unethical shenanigans and miscarriages of justice that the others get into, but I don't think that turning the fantasy of us against them into a reality will pan out for either side.Yeah, i've never had any bad experiences with police but then again, i never retaliate. Have you ever run into bad police?On several occasions, but that hasn't negatively colored my perception of a group of people who, by and large, are just trying to do their job in a negative light. Of course, I have the privilege of being white.That's good. You should like you have your head on straight and not influenced by others much

That's weird. Although mine did mention the shooter barricaded in the house. It was a weirdly worded article overall. Do you think the police are too aggressive?I think that police are trained to be aggressive in both speech and action, but only listening/watching media outlets will give you a very biased view of the situation. You?I agree. There's definitely bad police out there but only the bad ones are shown on media outlets like you said. The other 80% don't get creditI mean, I think there's something to be said for the so called "good cops" who are passively complicit in all the unethical shenanigans and miscarriages of justice that the others get into, but I don't think that turning the fantasy of us against them into a reality will pan out for either side.Yeah, i've never had any bad experiences with police but then again, i never retaliate. Have you ever run into bad police?On several occasions, but that hasn't negatively colored my perception of a group of people who, by and large, are just trying to do their job in a negative light. Of course, I have the privilege of being white.That's good. You should like you have your head on straight and not influenced by others muchBeing open to diverse viewpoints is critically important, but blindly swallowing and regurgitating the opinions of the group is dangerous.

<s>What a sad, sad story (:</s>I agree. I still think the dad was wrong.By the article, there was a great deal going on their lives, regardless of the Mom's PTSD with the little girl.   The entire household would be affected.   I just do not understand how things get so dark you would someone especially your family.I feel that it is a dad's job to protect his children and never to harm them. I feel sorry for all the things going on in their house, but that is no excuse for what he did.I totally agree.   If one of them had mental illness, the other should have insisted they get help or have them committed.It has to be hard on the both families what happened.All the parents, grandparents, friends, etc.   I cannot imagine what they all feel.Mark's family seemed really supportive.They did.   My daughter has a lifelong friend whose husband is very mentally ill.   Her lifelong friend will not do what is the best for him.   My daughter is a psyc major.   Her fear is he will kill of them.   They have three little boys.  It just seems like everybody has their head in the sand.   Just like this story.Sorry to hear that.The interesting thing about this article is Facebook told a different story.  I feel like most of Facebook just wants to project look at me, look at me.I agree, I do not post good or bad things to social media. I like my life to be my life.

<s>what a tragic story</s>yeah, it just goes to show that you can never really know what people are going through behind the scenes.I feel extreme pity for the kids and wife but nothing but anger for the husband-he is a coward for taking his young kids' lives!the dog too!yes! He could have worked things out with some counseling. If his wife did not want to be with him he did not have to kill everybody!True, thinking of all the wasted potential is truly depressing. They didn't really go into detail about the domestic abuse, but someone doesn't just turn into a murderer over night.I think the wife should have left him sooner, maybe the kids would still be alive today. When someone is abusive you just pack up and leave without even have them suspect anything-things can turn pretty ugly with abusive and mental people and there is no telling what they can do!Exactly, the fact he thought a trip to Disneyland was going to fix deeply rooted problems in his marriage was pretty pathetic.yes, the wife should have seen this as a red flag but I guess everybody thinks that their husband, no matter how abusive will kill them and their childrenHave you ever been in an abusive relationship?I came across people like that in relationships and cut it off right away, luckily, have you?yes, actually. I went through a long period of rationalizing their behavior before I cut it off though.

<s>Those poor children and that poor dog.</s>That was so disturbing to read. I agree, i can't believe someone can not only kill the children but also the dog?Yeah, poor pup didn't do anything wrong. Also, who decides that a trip to Disney World is going to resolve deeply rooted marital issues?Interesting people. I suffer from depression as well but i don't think i would ever do something that extreme.The vast majority of people who suffer from mental illnesses, myself included, are not violent in any way. It's the exceptional outliers that get all the attention.Yes! Which is why everyone thinks people with depression are "dangerous" or people just want to stay away form them.The stigma surrounding mental illness is inexcusable and unfounded, but bolstered by books, movies and television. So, the average person has no idea how warped their perception really is.These people need more help instead of people hating them you are rightAnd more social integration. Anyway, do you think the husband knew that his wife was broadcasting her intentions on Facebook?probably not, it was just a very messed up situatino. I still can't believe she couldn't even let the dog go.You have to be an exceptional kind of depraved to murder your own children in cold blood, but yeah, I keep coming back to the dog.I don't even know the logic. I'm trying to see it from her side and maybe she did it so the children don't grow up traumatized or whatever, but the  dog?? Why?!

Yes! Which is why everyone thinks people with depression are "dangerous" or people just want to stay away form them.The stigma surrounding mental illness is inexcusable and unfounded, but bolstered by books, movies and television. So, the average person has no idea how warped their perception really is.These people need more help instead of people hating them you are rightAnd more social integration. Anyway, do you think the husband knew that his wife was broadcasting her intentions on Facebook?probably not, it was just a very messed up situatino. I still can't believe she couldn't even let the dog go.You have to be an exceptional kind of depraved to murder your own children in cold blood, but yeah, I keep coming back to the dog.I don't even know the logic. I'm trying to see it from her side and maybe she did it so the children don't grow up traumatized or whatever, but the  dog?? Why?!Maybe the dog tried to intervene as she was murdering the only family the dog had.That's true, i was thinking more of the dog was outdoors and after she killed her family, she went out and shot the dog before shooting herselfOr, perhaps she never liked the dog and had a grudge against it for one reason or another.

<s>This article is so concerning.</s>I agree.Why do all the work to see if drinking water is safe, and then assess no fines or penalties?Yeah it makes absolutely no sense. It is crazy that only 3% faced any sort of repercussions.I know!   So we are wasting millions in analyzing and then do nothing.   The entire article I was thinking we need more Erin Brockovich's in the world to hold all accountable.So true. I was thinking that the government needs to set up some sort of national task force or something similar.I feel nothing is being done due to all the kickbacks and buyoffs that has to be going on.Yeah and all of the de-regulation. Not to mention that the head of the EPA is a stooge.Yes he is.   I think in another 20 years, clean water will be almost unattainableI think that will surely be true in a lot of places. However certain states have their own rules when it comes to water and they are better than others. As a whole the situation is going to get a lot worse unless something is done.I know.  There are several counties in Eastern KY and of course Michigan than have not had clean water for years.  Those counties in Eastern Kentucky were on TV.

The entire article I was thinking we need more Erin Brockovich's in the world to hold all accountable.So true. I was thinking that the government needs to set up some sort of national task force or something similar.I feel nothing is being done due to all the kickbacks and buyoffs that has to be going on.Yeah and all of the de-regulation. Not to mention that the head of the EPA is a stooge.Yes he is.   I think in another 20 years, clean water will be almost unattainableI think that will surely be true in a lot of places. However certain states have their own rules when it comes to water and they are better than others. As a whole the situation is going to get a lot worse unless something is done.I know.  There are several counties in Eastern KY and of course Michigan than have not had clean water for years.  Those counties in Eastern Kentucky were on TV.   They are poor and do not have the extra cash to buy water all the time.   There was a huge fundraiser that was done.  They raised enough for 2 years of water for them.   Residents were showing what their water was.   It was black sludge.   The county knew it and did nothing.   He was videoed and ran from the cameras.   Makes me very angry.It is unacceptable. Unfortunately I don't see anything changing unless there is a new President who supports the EPA in 2020.Obama didn't do anything for them either.   It should be at the top of every sitting President's list but it gets shoevedIt is true that those things happened while Obama was in office. I just don't see how anything can be done when Andrew Wheeler is the man in charge of the EPA.<s>I so agree.   EPA is run horribly.  My main concern other than the penalties/fines, etc. is what it is doing to our children.   I am extremely concerned.</s>I am as well. This article did not even mention PFAS. Have you heard of it?No - what is that?Substances which are used in firefighting foam and a variety of nonstick, cleaning, packaging and other household products, have been linked to thyroid disease and kidney, liver, pancreatic and testicular cancer. They get into the water supply at dangerous levels.Ooh.   None of this is good.   I think the whole process of getting anything done anymore is there are too many levels changes go through to get anything substantial done.Yeah that and lobbyists. I hate that lobbyists are allowed to operate how they do.And PACs for elections.  They are all corrupt.Yeah the Citizens United decision did so much harm to our country I think.It did.   You are very well versed in politics.  I barely watch it.  It's all opinions and few facts.I honestly never really paid attention to politics until 2016. It is very hard to know what is true and what is not true when it is not illegal to lie to the American people.(as long as you are not under oath.)Every President from the beginning of time lies, lies, lies.  The only one I feel was truthful was Abraham Lincoln.   Sad to type it.Yup lies and fake promises tot he people while making backroom deals with corporations and lobbyists.

<s>What did you think about the article?</s>I think this issue is going to be a major problem for older cities, what do you think?Absolutely.  And not even older cities anymore.

The county government in Eastern Kentucky just kept tons of money (I don't know the details - just saw it on the News) and nothing was fixed.   They have no drinking water, cooking water, or water to bathe or for toilets.  It just makes me mad.That makes me mad too. I like money too, but I wouldn't harm people to get it.Exactly.   The checks and balances have to improve before anything gets improved.What is the timeline of getting the people of Kentucky water back?It's been four years for them.  They showed the water that came out of many people's faucets.  It was completely black - Eastern KY is coal companies - they mine all the coal and do none of the reclamation so all the toxic chemicals just go into the drinking water.   Cancer there is 200% higher than national average.That is very shameful that we allow people to suffer like this in this country.

What did you think about the article?I think this issue is going to be a major problem for older cities, what do you think?Absolutely.  And not even older cities anymore.  Most states have areas where they have not had clean water for up to 5 years.   Small towns in Eastern Kentucky is an exampleYeah, I do not see a simple answer for this one.Me either.   EPA hands out violations but doesn't follow up or assign huge monetary fines is ridiculous.  Why do the work if there is no follow up to see if company fixed their issuesNot companies but local and state governments. I think what they did to Flint should be a crime.It was.    The county government in Eastern Kentucky just kept tons of money (I don't know the details - just saw it on the News) and nothing was fixed.   They have no drinking water, cooking water, or water to bathe or for toilets.  It just makes me mad.That makes me mad too. I like money too, but I wouldn't harm people to get it.<s>Exactly.   The checks and balances have to improve before anything gets improved.</s>What is the timeline of getting the people of Kentucky water back?It's been four years for them.  They showed the water that came out of many people's faucets.  It was completely black - Eastern KY is coal companies - they mine all the coal and do none of the reclamation so all the toxic chemicals just go into the drinking water.   Cancer there is 200% higher than national average.That is very shameful that we allow people to suffer like this in this country.We are the United States of America on the decline.  Pollution, drinking water, education, housing costs, 1 out of 5 people are hungry - we need to oust everyone every year in the government so it doesn't become about them personally.I can agree with that, outside money should have never have been allowed in government.Agreed.

<s>I don't buy this story of a guy "accidentally " dying in a hotel</s>yea seems sketchywe know that Russian dictators take out anyone who is against themyes i heard bout another story where they attempted to kill  a father and daughter who were spiesor the guy who got poisoned a while ago, they slipped something in his teathey definitely do not do a great job of covering it upor they simply don;t care, I recall they shot somebody last year in Ukraine, in the broad day light!wow that is insane! the 3 diffrent causes of death have me puzzled. They are three completely different ways to die and they fumbled over the official cause for a long time which was odd.Putin will not let any real "investigations" take place-that place is a total lawless land, I feel really bad for the people therei do as well. He makes it seem like the people are free but they are not. it's very dangerous.yes, that's why USA still remains the safest place to live at this day and age-we are not perfect but at least we have rights vs countries like Russia who seem "democratic" and yet people are totally oppressedI totally agree it makes you feel so grateful knowing that is not how our country runs. It is little scary knowing it did happen in the usa and america did not take criminal action.

He makes it seem like the people are free but they are not. it's very dangerous.yes, that's why USA still remains the safest place to live at this day and age-we are not perfect but at least we have rights vs countries like Russia who seem "democratic" and yet people are totally oppressedI totally agree it makes you feel so grateful knowing that is not how our country runs. It is little scary knowing it did happen in the usa and america did not take criminal action.well, luckily we now have Trump in the house, I don;t think he will allow any garbage like this-we still have our rights and guns, thank God!I am going to be honest I was afraid to mention trump becausemany people these days get offended but I agree 100 percent with you. Trump makes this country feel so much safer.I just stay away from political discussions around people because you know how they feel about Trump-but anyone with clear head knows he is good for this country-so let them get offended while he tries to give them jobs and fix their lives!It feels like the media gets into peoples heads and people believe everything they hear without researching. It seems weird when new that is supposed to be non bias focuses so much on anti trump. It makes me so angry they can fool that many people.fake news-as Trump himself calls it. I stay away from TV as much as possible-they try to control and brainwash people, especially these young and impressionable minds.it it so sad to see how some people act towards trump especially on twitter. With recent events I have avoided twitter alltogether.<s>yes, better to stay away, lots of negativity and deranged people out there</s>they will complain the entire time the economy is doing great and whie they lead successful lives because of trump. People like Bernie Sanders make me so angry they play on poor peoples hot points making false promises they know they can never fulfill.Bernie is a crazy but job-on top of that he is a filthy rich person that most of these silly people don;t know, he always beats himself on the chest like he was poor and knows what it's like but the guy has mansions all over the placeand he can't even fulfill his promises of $15 wages for his employees because he knows how bad of an idea that is.precisely, anyone who wants to see him elected is out of their mind. there will be a communism.i agree! have you ever watched the joe rogan podcast?unfortunately notI highly recommend he brings a great non biased platform for everyone to speak while also asking the important questionsthank you, I will look into itAwesome! I really enjoyed talking politics with you!same here, thank you and God bless, goodbye!God bless to you as well! goodbye

<s>It is hard to believe he had all those injuries, but we will never know.</s>What a tragedy!I do not know if I would call it a tragedy, but it is sad when anybody dies.The circumstances do raise a number of questions about what may have really occurredI agree with that. I do not trust Russia because they are known for killing people who upset the government.There seem to be a lot of issues in Russia that deserve a closer lookThe thing that stood out most for me were the injures to other parts of the body. I could understand a head injury from a fall.Yeah, it makes me suspicious of the official explanation as wellAnd it took so long for the investigation.And we will probably never know the full storyI agree with that. I wonder what made the family say heart attack so quickly.Maybe pressure from the government?
