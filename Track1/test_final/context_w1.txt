Yes, they have oil. Afghanistan is rich in resources like copper, gold, oil, natural gas, uranium, bauxite, coal, iron ore, rare earths, lithium, chromium, lead, zinc, gemstones, talc, sulphur, travertine, gypsum and marble.  They could pull themselves out of poverty if they wanted to.  But they would rather blackmail western countries to get a handout like they have for 30 years.<s>Then they need to mine these resources. The government is probably corrupt and wants to keep the money to themselves like Venezuela.</s>Unfortunately they are using the Mao Zedong philosophy of "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun".  It is in the governments best interest to keep war going and keep the aid flowing.  That's where they get their political power.  If they let companies come in and set up shop, those companies would get the political power by virtue of the money they would make.

My first impression is that it will be difficult to prevent people from fighting back when they see a wolf hanging around. Although it's kind of sad, yes.

How would you help the civilian's plight?<s>I would keep fighting the terrorists and showing the civilians that there's a simple choice to be made here.  You either stop putting up with terrorism in your country and actively seek a stable, peaceful nation, or you continue to deal with chaos and war.  Those are the choices.  I think the civilians ultimately have to decide what type of country they want to live in and to fight for it, just like Americans did in the Revolutionary War, and innumerable other wars.</s>I am no aware of any international charities to help war-torn countries, how about you?
