            "I think it's super sad... they seem to never catch a break, always struggling.",
            "I can't imagine just living in an area that is constantly being ravaged by hurricanes or earthquakes. I take my location for granted.",
            "Me too.. I also can't imagine living in the poverty and such.. It's crazy to think that people still live like that sometimes.  The gap between first world countires and places like that is crazy to em",
            "It also seems unnecessary for there to even be such a gap. With all of the wealthy countries out there, I hope Haiti gets the help it deserves, because we, and other countries, can certainly afford it.",
            "Agreed... with how frivilous and unnessary our spending is, it's so sad that countries like that don't get more support or guidance.",
            "It's disheartening, isn't it? Places have the ability, money, time, and knowledge, and still refuse to help.",
            "It is so sad... Or even the millionaires/billionaires out there. I know some of them donate, but at some point, you can only spend so much money. Why not put it to use.",
            "Yep, exactly. It's just very frustrating overall. I think it's hard for others because they don't understand until their houses are being swept away for torrential floods.",
            "It is hard to fathom/process, it's hard for me to really imagine",
            "Give it twenty more years, for the more compassionate people to come into leadership. I think we'll see a big difference.",
            "I think that is a fair statement... the new generation seems more caring and compassionate and willing to help",
            "I know it sounds cold, but the older generation either doesn't care, or doesn't want to understand. Trust me, we'll see some major change soon enough.",
            "I totally agree... I know there are some out there that care, but the majority, and the ones in charge, really don't seem to",
            "Well, it was really great talking to you. I can't think of anything else to say about the topic. goodbye",
            "we don't have enough lines yet",
            "I apologize, I thought we did! I'm obviously a winner at counting. Hurricane Matthew was two years ago, wasn't it?",
            "Haha no worries, we should be there now. That sounds about right to me, crazy, time flies, seems like I was just hearing about it",
            "I think I recall it spawning a second hurricane, too, but it calmed down before being too bad. Yeah, I was definitely a few lines off lol",
            "I kinda remember that too...Well it has been great talking to you! bye :)",

            "I think if the UN is able to get them the required funds that will help a lot.",
            "I am inclined to disagree. More money is only a temporary solution. I think they need lasting change",
            "Yes, I hear there is a lot of corruption there as well, that is also a problem. Money is short term",
            "Yes corruption is a huge problem. I think the NGO's and the UN should focus more on teaching the Haitian people to help themselves and develop the country",
            "Yes getting a better government is the best way to help any region. Most countries, do not absolutely need outside for every disaster",
            "I don't think the US wants a ''better'' government. They want a government they can control or influence. Corruption helps with that agenda",
            "Yes two things can be true at once though. They want a better government but also try to get power and control in the process.",
            "Do you think the United States has a vested interest in a developed and autonomous Haiti? I don't think so",
            "Yeah I would not count on it. So you think the change should come from within?",
            "Yes. I think that is the only way to get lasting long term and meaningful change. We have to help them help themselves",
            "Yes that is why I think giving them aid, with no strings attached, is a good way to do this.",
            "I disagree. With all the corruption it would just be money wasted. We should control the funds and focus more on sending people and material",
            "Yeah but you can not have it both ways, either we send money and get power and control, or we send it no strings attached. So I think there might have to be strings actually, as you reminded me of the corruption.",
            "Some other questions would be how much money and how long would we have to be involved?",
            "I think the article said the UN was looking to send $800 million. No more then ten years in my opinion",
            "I think 10 years is a good figure. But it seems like any problems Haiti has are only made worse by natural disasters. And no one can stop those",
            "Yes there will always be disasters. Until the core problem of the country is fixed, I think we will always have to be ready to help.",
            "That might take a lot longer than 10 years. It might be a good idea if the UN established permanent or semi permanent facilitiesc",
            "Yes I think if we could supply them advisers and disaster professionals they could greatly benefit",
            "True, but who would want to go there long term? I know I wouldn't. It's so far away and so different",
            "I probably would not. We would have to compensate those individuals well.",
            "The compensation would have to be high to motivate the right people",
            "Yeah but I think the fact they would be helping those in need, could also be a motivation",
            "True but would it be enough to keep them from their friends and family for long durations?",
            "Probably different for each person, I am optimistic though.",

            "I always think stories of foster kids are pretty sad.",
            "I agree... it's such a bad system sometimes and it breaks my heart, cause they are kids",
            "Of course the kids make matters worse with delinquency, but that's not unexpected behavior considering their experiences.",
            "Agreed, I'm sure he would be less likely to do that if he  had grown up in more stable conditions. It seems a lot of times the foster care system puts them in a situation that is just as bad or worse then where they wer ebefore",
            "Yes, although even in good situations it sometimes doesn't work.  I knew an adopted boy and girl who'd come from a very violent background.  They destroyed the adoptive family they were brought into.  The damage had already been done to them as people.",
            "Oh that's so sad... My neighbors did foster care a lot, and they were a great family. but man some of the kids you could tell had been through some shit and they were so angry.",
            "Yeah, bless the people who are willing to do that.  And I'm sure most have good intentions.  But it's definitely a tough situation for everyone.",
            "Agreed, I'm sure it would put a strain on any family or couple, especially if the kids are a handful",
            "At least there was something of a silver lining in this story.",
            "for sure! I just wish he could have been helped out more in the process, or for it to be easier on him",
            "Yes, although I'd also go back to the mother and say the problem starts there. The mother (and probably father) were the first to let the kids down.",
            "Agreed.... I can't imagine being that kind of parent. i don't get people who are. But there seems to be so many",
            "Yes, unfortunately.  It's very easy to have children but not so easy to raise them well.",
            "For sure... But it should be worth it to raise them well, it's your responsibility for having kids",
            "Absolutely, I agree.  I think if you have children you owe them that.  And most people resent their parents enough you'd think they'd try harder with their own kids.  But few do.",
            "For sure... it seems everyone has parent problems, but then seem to end up parenting the same way",
            "It's a strange phenomenon.  At least to me.  But we're often more creatures of habit and genetics and convenience than of thoughtful consideration and values.",
            "That is a great way to phrase it... It's very interesting for sure. Especially when you have 18+years to change",
            "Do you have any children?",
            "I don't, but my husband and I are trying",
            "Sounds fun.  I hope you're successful and you, your husband, and future children are all thankful for it.  I don't have kids and figure it's best for all parties involved that it stays that way.",
            "thank you! haha my husband felt that way for a while... It's scary for  sure the thought of bringing another human into this world",
            "Yes,it's certainly a big responsibility.  But I'm sure you'll do fine.",
            "Thank you! I sure will try haha",

            "Hey there, this article is pretty morbid. It really hits home for me though since I've dealt with this subject before.",
            "Yeah, I thought it was very troubling because of the number of times she went for help, and she was always just turned away, essentially.",
            "Yea suicide is no joke. It took me a couple of years before I received the help I needed and still it was a struggle. I feel so bad that this poor woman didn't get help. It's really messed up.",
            "That's really sad to hear that it took that long. I'm not surprised at all, but it's ridiculous that mental health issues aren't treated as seriously as other medical issues since they can be just as fatal.",
            "Exactly. Plus it really really hurts when people like, look at you as less of a person for having these issues.",
            "Yeah, there is definitely an incredible stigma around it, treated as a weakness rather than a health issue. Can see that in this article too, a constant attitude of \"you're all right, go home.\" Until the worst happens, then they act surprised.",
            "I always hated it when people told me that. Especially family members. Never had a doctor say that though. Must've been so so rough for this woman.",
            "Yeah, if you can't get help from doctors, who can you get help from? I definitely have heard stories like this before though, since mental health care is so overstressed and understaffed, people who aren't considered 'in immediate danger' just get sent home.",
            "It's a shame and just messed up. I can't imagine the extent of the dread she felt. Like I've been there, but for so many repeated attempts to get help, just to be turned away.. that'll mess you up so much more.",
            "Right, because I imagine she felt hopeless or unimportant. I guess the question is how things can be improved in the mental health care system?",
            "Honestly, the first step is that people just need to take these things seriously. And insurance companies need to start covering treatments. It took me forever to find a decent psych. And of course insurance doesn't cover it. It's messed up. It all comes down to money these days I think.",
            "Yeah, I think it would take a generational change, like starting with education in schools about mental health care and that it's just like any other illness that needs to be respected and understood.",
            "For sure. Through my experience I find that it is older people that are the most..uh.. skeptical when it comes to topics/illnesses like these.",
            "Yeah, they were raised with a \"suck it up\" attitude and people with more severe mental illness were hidden away or sent away. I don't know how much can be done about people like them, would be best to focus efforts on the young and then try to change society from the bottom.",
            "Oh man the amount of times I heard \"suck it up\" or \" you have no reason to be depressed.\" That messed me up bad.",
            "I'm sorry that happened to you. It's so ignorant. We definitely need education campaigns and PSAs to try and educate people.",
            "For sure. It's kinda messed up when your own family is ignorant to your blatantly obvious issues. Which ties back into that article. I can't even inagine what it feels like for a doctor to just tell you to get over it. That's like going to the police to report a major crime and they just say \"deal with it yourself.\"",
            "Yeah I feel like that whole system needs a massive overhaul. Like that's their government system so they need to be extra accountable over there.",
            "Yea and you'd think that they would be. But of course healthcare takes a backseat to like idk.. butter knife licenses or something pointless. On a side note though.. drowning in the ocean must be one of the worst ways to go. Like thats prolonged panic and suffering before lights out. Legit sounds absolutely horrible.",
            "Yeah, she took one of the worst ways out. She must have been desperate.",
            "For sure. You have to be really desperate to put yourself through that. I'm glad I never hit that point; I'd rather it be quick if it was gonna happen. But lord, that woman's death was so needless. It did not need to happen and the fact that help was refused is so disgusting. I wonder if those doctors even felt remorse about it.",
            "I feel like it probably happens a lot so they might be numb to it.",
            "Ah yea they probably deal with death all the time. Didn't think about that.",
            "It's something that needs to be investigated by people above them though, like by politicians etc, they need new directives to properly handle things.",
            "For real. But will they actually do anything is the real question. I'm not sure if half of them take mental issues seriously either.",
            "I wonder if in that particular case, in the UK, if it will help that it was someone involved with the news media. Like it might make the media pay more attention to it and they'll get more pressure because of that.",
            "That is a good point. Sometimes it does take a tragedy from someone famous to get the ball rolling. Kinda sad that it does take that though to be honest.",
            "Yep, I feel like that's typical though, and we just need to work with it.",
            "As with most things in our lives I suppose.",
            "Yeah. If the media puts pressure, that might actually cause some change, even if it's sad that that is what it takes. It's better than nothing. Could be the start of a good education campaign.",
            "And honestly that is what we need. Just some good education to get people to realize that this stuff is serious. Well anyway, it's been a lovely chat with you Random Turker. Here's hoping the rest of the work day goes smoothly :)",
            "For sure. Have a good rest of your day. :)",

            "Hey there! So this article is something. I can't help but wonder why people of different religious backgrounds can't seem to get along in that part of the world. We seem to do ok over here in the West.",
            "Hello! To a certain extent. I mean, the recent attacks on synagogues and widespread prejudice against Muslims here in the west doesn't seem to be too far removed.",
            "Good point. Maybe I am a bit biased in this. I am not a very religious person. Personally I think it causes more problems in the world. Too many violent acts in the name of God, or Allah, etc. The needless loss of life is quite saddening.",
            "I agree and am on the same page when it comes to religiosity. It seems like these militant groups in the Middle East are sincerely devoted to unmaking thousands of years of human progress.",
            "Yea. I don't understand it personally. I guess their religion demands them to kill? Or maybe people in power have just twisted it into that meaning. It's just a shame though that people are being persecuted for their beliefs. What does it matter if someone else worships a different being than you? How does that effect you?",
            "From what I understand about these groups is that they have decided to pervert their sacred texts in their interpretation so that they are in fact called to violence. An analog would be the Westboro Baptist church here in the states. If someone is not following the same religious tenets as you it makes them much more difficult to control; you aren't playing by the same rules.",
            "Of course it comes down to control. I hate that people ar elike that to eachother tho. But of course I suppose it is in our nature to try to be dominant over eachother. Also as for Westboro, those people disgust me. Absolute degenerates full of hatred.",
            "Hatred can be a very powerful force. Unfortunately, it seems that our world is filled with more of it every day; or at least those who are full of hatred have the loudest voices. I'd like to think that these militants truly believe that they are saving peoples souls, but the fact that they would allow them to stay as long as they paid a tax kind of robs the whole process of any mystique. This whole thing is about power. I agree about any self righteous group too. Can't you find something that is actually productive to do with your time?",
            "I just hate that so many people need to suffer. It isn't right, no matter the reason, to persecute and murder people. And using religious views as a cover isn't an excuse. It also doesn't help that entire part of the world is so volitile in general. Hasn't there been conflict there for literal centuries?",
            "Exactly, and that conflict prevents them from making any marked social or political progress at the lower levels of society. The rich get richer and the poor are left to fight each other over the scraps that remain. Plus, in a lot of ways America specifically has been spurning on this conflict for it's own vested interest in arms sales.",
            "Don't forget the oil as well. We gotta chug that sweet sweet crude at the expense of our own soldiers lives, and the natives lives. It's a vicious cycle of greed, and power",
            "Right, it's a crying shame. I have a very difficult time attempting to put myself in the shoes of the people who are affected by these types of problems. I mean, waking up in the middle of the night to your family being slaughtered or sold into slavery and being told to just deal with it?",
            "And the trauma of war in general as well. Always living in fear of weather or not you are going to get bombed, shot, raped, etc. I'm sure that there is an immense amount of suffering in that region.",
            "It's insane. The question is, what can we in the west even do to help? Is there anything at all?",
            "Well the only thing we can do is use military, but that in and of itself is a bad thing because then they hate us even more.",
            "I think that it would depend on the approach. I've heard there has been some success in the US forces training a standing army in Afghanistan, but not much. I was thinking more about humanitarian efforts.",
            " . Not sure what we could do in that regard. I don't think they'll listen to the UN. Ugh it's just a complicated situation.",
            "Yes, and after having this conversation definitely something I need to get more information on. I don't know about you but i've only about ten minutes left on my HIT timer, so why don't we wrap this up relatively quickly?",
            "Same here.",
            "So, do you hail from the states?",
            "Indeed I do. Right in the bible belt.",
            "Ha! Me too.",
            "Yea. Thats why when you mentioned Westboro I immediately was like. Ew.",
            "I've just seen them mentioned in mainstream media on occasion. Do you usually keep up with new?",
            "Yea most of the time. People around here hate that group. They picketed at a marines funeral here once.",
            "I actually heard about that. Totally shameful. Do you have family in the military?",

            "It's a shame. They are hurting their own people instead of being able to move forward away from this crisis.",
            "Also I think it's only a small fraction of the fanatical Muslims that are to blame.",
            "Granted, that may be true. But that small fraction on both sides is hindering the whole situation.",
            "Yup. Anyway, it was really nice of France to welcome Christians that feared going back to Mosul.",

            "No, sadly America's own political stragedy prohibits too much outside assistance for that.",

            "Some are allowed to come, but not nearly the amount that actually need help and assistance.",
            "Yeah but the amount of people that need help and assistance is far more people than we can handle. That's millions of people!",
            "Agreed completely! America can't do that. I'm not on board with the complete denial. I think petitions are needed to keep the process flowing.",

            "Yea, the woman is really a fighter. I love her. I lost an uncle to cancer last year",
            "I lost my dad last year to a brain tumor. And my Grandmother had a rare bone marrow cancer. You'd think with all the medical technology we have now adays we could find a cure wit hlike gene therapy or something.",
            "wow..that is sad. So sorry about that. Yea. I feel the pharmaceutical companies are deliberately keep it secret.",
            "Honestly with the amount of money that is generated from cancer treatments and donations they probably are. God that would be absolutely horrible though.",
            "It really is pitiable. Its disturbing that human lives is not valued.",
            "It really is. Very sad that people value currency over their fellow man. Back toa bout the woman though, I wonder what drives her to have such a positive outlook. My father was very depressed when he got ill, which is a very normal reaction. I just wonder what enabled this woman to be so optimistic about it all.",
            "Might be a moment of self discovery for her.",
            "That is a good point. I suppose getting told that you might be dying would make anyone think about their life and everything.",
            "It definitely will, but not so many people are willing to embrace it.",
            "I guess religion also helps. If you are that kind of person of course. It's such a rough disease though. And we still use chemo. I wish we'd find some better treatments at least. When my dad went through chemo he got so much worse. Mentally and illness wise.",
            "Yeah, many people tend to shy away from that though. Religion is a huge factor.",
            "My dad wasn't very religious so I guess all he saw was the end and that was it. I can't imagine going through cancer personally. You need a lot of strength to get through the treatments and still somehow have a positive outlook.",

            "Of my dads cancer?",

            "Wow..what causes the uncontrolled cell division?",
            "Pretty sure its a mutation in the DNA of the cell. Or is it the RNA? Been a hot minute since I learned all this stuff haha.",

            "Yeah but I thought of them as nimble creatures. Like an better version of a bear. And basically they way they hunt is by ambushing seals at ice openings.",
            "they are certainly the biggest type of bear, which always seem odd to me",

            "Yeah, it'd have to be whenever NASA gets mentioned in an article lol.",

            "conservation efforts for near extinction tend to go to keeping them in zoos until the habitat can sustain them again",

            "yea, i can't recall, but i have watched the live cams for them before. their enclosures are mostly big pools of water",
            "Yeah, I just googled it and there's lots of cool videos on youtube. Also sometimes they build big enclosures for one type of animal. There could be a polar bear national park or something in the arctic.",
            "them some brave people with money to go to one that far up north",
            "Some animal animal conservation groups have deep pockets.",

            "Probably, getting grants for studying environmental problems are probably easier to acquire than for other subjects. I just googled some polar bear stuff and there was an article from 2018 talking about the problem. They said the main issue with low polar bear populations is inbreeding. Also they discussed Canada air dropping food and said it would cost 2 million a month.",
            "yea, if populations are low inbreeding is yet another issue. bad genes get a hold of the population. interesting that they even considered air dropping. i guess it only has to be in the active time of the year. so around 10 - 12 million",

            "I have in the past. Have you?",
            "Not intensely, that I can remember. There was one older kid on the bus that gave me the business sometimes, but we ended up being friends after a time. How did you respond to being bullied?",
            "I can relate to that. I was not severely bullied. It was off and on through elementary and some of middle school. In those moments of being bullied, i would usually ignore it. I was a resilient kid. Are you still friends with that person?",
            "Haha, no. That was over 15 years ago. Do you have any ideas on the appropriate response to widespread bullying?",
            "I think it depends. I think the bully that happens today is a bit different from the kind many experienced back then. Also, kids that get bullied today, their response to bullying varies.",
            "I understand that, but there are a limited amount of ways to respond to verbal and physical abuse. I don't think that the way children respond varies much from when we were children. I think the key difference is that bullying doesn't end just because you're home from school. It can be something that haunts you around the clock day in and day out.",
            "Yes, that's what i meant. Bullying does not end even when you're home. What do you think would be an appropriate response to bullying?",
            "Unplugging, first and foremost. I don't participate in social media, but I think that it has been an overwhelmingly negative influence on society. The reason that children go to the lengths that this French girl did is because they feel absolutely alone in their suffering. Inclusion is the answer. Something as simple as assigning each child a emotional support classmate could do wonders for kids who are being singled out.",
            "That is true. Social media has made a great impact on younger generations. I cannot imagine the impact it would have had on me as a kid. I do agree that inclusion is important and vital. I have never thought of the idea of assigning emotional support classmates. That is an absolutely great idea. Have you seen this used in the real world?",
            "No, not in any kind of administrative capacity. But, I think that it could potentially be very effective. The modern world has a way of distorting the best of intentions though.",
            "How do you mean?",
            "Well, an emotional support could potentially become an emotional detriment if a child chose to betray another child's confidence either maliciously or by complete accident.",
            "I see. That is a something completely possible. I can see adults playing a better role for emotional support within the classroom. Perhaps having an assigned adult per classroom or something of that sort.",
            "Right, when I was in elementary school we had parent volunteers called \"den mothers\" (our school mascot was a lion) who shared their information with children and provided a sympathetic ear. I'd actually be interested to see what a normal day at a public school looks like these days.",
            "We had something similar in elementary as well. Except, from what i remember, they were teachers assistants. They did the typical TA duties but were there as well to provide emotional support. I am curious too how a normal day is at a public school.",
            "I mean, my youngest brother is now home schooled and I know that people who can afford it now send their children to private schools. The devaluation of public education in the US has been profound and embarrassing.",
            "I was homeschooled for high school. As a teen i absolutely hated it at first but now that i am older i have come to appreciate it. Public education is definitely not where is should be. I wish the government would make education a focus. It's been busy on other things of course.",
            "I went to a boarding school for two years in high school. I also absolutely hated it at the time but looking back I was healthier than I had ever been in my life up to that point. I enjoyed chatting with you! bye",
            "Bye. Thanks!",

            "It is terrible. It doesn't even sound like its a thrill ride. It sounds like its just one of those water rides that you kinda float along and get wet but no massive drops or turns. I wouldn't have thought about getting hurt on a ride like that.",
            "I agree. The boat or whatever they were on capsizing is basically the only way you could get hurt. This story makes me angry too, how could a ride with so many problems pass inspection 3 days earlier?",
            "I don't know that makes me angry too. Because of someones incompetence people are devastated by the loss of someone close to them.",
            "Yup. Also that ride was problem plagued pretty much the entire day. If they're having that much trouble with a relatively simple ride, how about you shut it down for the day??",
            "No kidding. Its not like there wasn't other rides to go on. just shut it down. Since its in Australia I wonder if they have to follow the same guidelines the theme parks here in the US have to follow? I'm pretty sure there's restrictions and guidelines. Or maybe thats just wishful thinking. lol",
            "I think 3rd world countries are the only ones with less restrictions than America lol. At least they shut the park down but I think we would do that too.",
            "I don't know lol I'm not really familar with any theme parks other then Disney and I think they're kinda a class unto themselves. lol I'm not one for roller coasters and after reading this I'm not sure I want to go on any water rides now lol",
            "I think that's a little bit of an irrational thought. It happens to everyone though. Just because a plane crashes doesn't mean you should drive 30 hours to your destination instead. Roller coasters are a little bit different but on those water rides, you probably have a .0000000001% chance of dying. And I haven't been to an amusement park in a while. I go to fairs sometimes though and I doubt they have much restrictions regarding ride safety.",
            "True. We have our local fair going on right now and I took my daughter on the giant slide and going up the stairs that thing was so rickety I really don't think it was put together right. lol",
            "You probably feel worse after reading this story lol. And the problem with these small fairs is they probably can't afford the safety checks and engineers to properly maintain the ride.",
            "No they probably can't which is too bad because they're such a fun thing to do once a year that doesn't require traveling far",
            "Yeah and the food is usually incredible too. I love fairs!! Do you think the park will be liable for this accident? Or maybe you waive your rights when you purchase tickets?",
            "I bet they are liable. I don't think that you would waive your rights unless you explicitly sign a waiver. But who knows maybe they make everyone sign a waiver.",
            "If they are liable, they're in trouble. I'm not sure how much money it would require to replace having a mother for your life. And that's just the one person, I think four people died in this situation.",
            "Yeah 4 and I'm sure they will all sue for whatever they can. I think they can not only sue the park but probably whoever the person is that allowed the ride to continue to stay open after failing the safety checks"

It'd be nice if the local government put fencing or something around where they fell, so this doesn't happen again. Also it's strange that the article didn't talk about the part of their family that survived this tragedy and are grieving now.",

            "Maybe. Especially if the father/son were still alive and potentially could've been treated at a hospital if not for the helicopter issues. Or maybe the local government could be blamed for not maintaining the trail they were on (do you want to continue or end)?",

            "That is a great question. That's one of the reasons I suspect foul play. The last person with victim(s) is usually the first suspect",
            "And there had to be someone who called it in, unless the father or son were in good enough condition to dial 911.",
            "It could have been another hiker. The call would have to have been made shortly after the fall since the rescue helicopter was dispatched",
            "Yeah, I wonder if this was a popular hiking destination? Also I wonder what kind of evidence there would be if foul play occurred? Maybe branches broken in weird ways that show a struggle occurred?",

            "You would think that they would have some sort of backup plan or maybe a spare chopper though.",
            "Yeah doesn't really make me feel like they can be relied on",
            "I wonder if they are underequipped to handle situations. Maybe they don't get enough funding.",
            "Maybe they dont have the funding youre right",
            "I mean if so that is pretty messed up; especially in Cali. People get hurt hiking and rock climbing all the time there so you'd think they'd beef up the rescue response.",
            "They definitely need to be more prepared",
            "If I recall the response to the recent wildfire was kinda eh as well. Search and Rescue wise I mean. The firefighters worked their butts off.",
            "They can learn a thing or two from firefighters",
            "Real talk. Those people go at their job hardcore. Although seeing as Cali has wildfires literally every year they are probably better funded as well.",

            "True. Their role is equally as important though. Too many ill prepared people do risky things and end up in trouble.",
            "I remember hearing Trump wanted to cut federal aid to Cali which is probably why the rescue team is so bad.",
            "Wait really? What the hell? That's kinda messed up. Even if they oppose him pollitically like, their people too dude.",

            "Yeah they are equally as important as everyday cops.",
            "Man cops get too much flak. Yes some of them are corrupt and some are trigger happy, but the majority are legit there to do their job.",
            "Cops are more good than bad",
            "Yea. Around my area they are really good. I think only one in the past 6ish years has been thrown off the force for doing something dumb.",
            "they give out toys to kids at the local parks around LA all the time",
            "They do that here too around christmas. Although I have a feeling they are underfunded as well. They still drive beat up partol cars from the 90's",

            "Amen to that. But of course we gotta be the world police right? Ugh.",

            "aren't we still in Afghanistan? lol",
            "We are in Afganistan, Iraq, Iran (unofficially, but I know people based there,) basically like every country in the middle east at this point.",
            "don't forget we have bases in Germany, Japan, etc for no reason. If Russia did that we'd be calling them evil.",
            "Oh man yea truth for sure. I bet that new space force is gonna get proper funding though amirite? Man we are in such a pit as a country right now.",
            "yeah its quite depressing to see some people without health care and then see new fighter jets being built",
            "Yea I know how that feels personally. It's bull. Our monetary allocation is all over the place.",
            "1st world country btw",
            "Yea totally. Hell my mom can't even afford her medication to function every day. It is ridiculous.",
            "yeah its not very fair how they allocate everything",
            "Maybe one day things will get better. One can hope.",

            "I don't know the details; and i'm not one to make assumptions, but it rang true when the article mentioned that these types of suicide are often impulsive decisions made rashly in emotional circumstances.",
            "Yeah and with the internet, it's really easy for a kid to google to find out a suicide method.",
            "I think it serves as more than just a resource for methods at this point. Children are exposed to so much on the internet these days it is difficult for me to fathom.",

I think the article had a point when it mentioned that listening to your child and actually having a functional and supportive relationship with them is the greatest deterrent. So many children get home from school and just plug into the television or their telephone.",
            "Yeah but it really takes patience and persistence. I remember not really wanting to talk to my parents about school related things even though I had a good relationship with them. Somehow ensuring that your children have a good friend network would also be important. They shouldn't ever feel alone in the problems their having.",
            "Patience and persistence should be requirements for anyone to become a parent. You can definitely be a refuge for your children without being overbearing.",
            "That's true but you need to suffer through many monotonous conversations. \"How was school?\" \"Good.\" Times that by 1,000 until the kid needs advice about something.",
            "I'm not a parent, so it's quite easy for me to armchair quarterback, but I think a little nuance will go a long way. \"How's so and so? Did you see * today?\" Is your english teacher still a jerk? Etc.\"",
            "Yeah, I'm just seeing through the kid perspective and the kinds of conversations I had with my parents. I just wanted them to be over so I could talk about what I wanted to talk about. Something needs to be done though, as car accident fatalities and homicides went down but suicides went up...",

            "Yeah I read they were raped by camp leaders which makes it worse",
            "It really does. Rape in general is just one of those unforgivable things and it sickens me that people are barbaric enough to commit it.",
            "Yeah as a man, I couldn't live with myself knowing I raped a woman.",
            "Likewise, and I've been sexually abused before so I somewhat know what they are going through; not the hopelessness but the pain..",
            "Thats terrible sorry to hear about that. I have people in my family who have also been abused and it is just depressing to think about.",
            "Yea people are really messed up. Luckily i got the help I needed but those poor women have to endure it.. I don't like that our country is the \"wold police\" but those rapists deserve a bullet real talk.",

            "Yeah its hard for some guys to do that",

            "I'm assuming you know more about the subject and would know much more about this but as a man I can also sympathize with rape victims I can only imagine the feeling like no one is listening",
            "Yea it is pretty rough; it's evenw orse as a man because a lot of people think that because you are a man you can't be raped. Especially if you are sexually abused by a woman.",
            "yeah people think its fine if its a woman doing the raping",
            "Which it for sure isnt. Like if I don't want it it is the same as if ai woman doesn't want it. Doesn't help that it was in high school either at a time in my life where I was heavily depressed. Of course no one wants to lsisten to a high school kid about that though; especially in the bible belt.",

            "That's cool! haha",
            "Yea they were really hush hush about my issues. Kinda sucked; kinda forced religion on me but it is what it is.",
            "man that just sucks. I dont wanna get into details but I wish more would've been done to help you out.",
            "Well now that I'm an adult i got the help I needed so it worked out in the end. It was just rough for a while.",
            "That's great to know!",

            "I think it is really sad that those animals had to suffer. Who thought it was a good idea to put a zoo in one of the most war torn areas in the middle east?",
            "Yeah...I don't necessarily think the violence in the area had much to do with the terrible conditions in the zoo. The zoo owners cared more about profit than the conditions of the animals.",
            "That is for sure true; I just think the location for sure doesn't help. Either way though animals shouldn't have to suffer like that.",
            "The owners just weren't equipped, knowledge wise, for this task. I don't think the tiger being fed chicken all its life was a consequence of the area. The owners were just clueless and blamed the conflict for their inadequacy. And I agree, the animals are always innocent and I hope they are enjoying themselves right now!",
            "This reminds me of another article I read for one of these HITs maybe 3 days ago; but there was another zoo where people were feeding the tigers mango because they couldn't afford to feed them meat. It was in Venezuela :(",
            "I can slightly understand that issue though. People in Venezuela have enough problems feeding themselves! It's truly a dire situation over there.",
            "Yea. Maybe it was greed at the pollitical level, but for sure not the zoo. I don't understand though why people feel the need to get exotic animals even though they cant properly take care of them; especially a zoo. People are really messed up when it comes to flipping a profit. Even the japanese are exploiting animals again for cash; they started whaling again. Well technically they never stopped but now it is official on paper again.",
            "Speaking of poaching, I had an article about elephant tusks a couple days back. And I later googled that elephant tusks go for around 400k. And in poor areas in Africa, that's basically lottery money. And at that point, I'm not sure you can even blame the poachers. You blame the people who are buying the ivory and elephant parts for ancient medicine stuff. It's disgusting that they think elephant or whale parts will affect diseases.",
            "Holy crap they are worth that much? Man that is so wrong. No wonder the problem is so persistant if the market is that good. Such a shame though. And yea I don't understand how some rhino horn can treat the common cold. That's just needless slaughter. Oh don't get me started on shark-fin soup either...",
            "That price was from an article in 2016. And since they've outlawed the sale of all ivory, the price has probably doubled or tripled. The people who are hunting these amazing animals are decked out like soldiers...Anyway, this article really inspired me. A guy saw that animals were being mistreated and immediately started planning on how to save them.",
            "It always brings a smile to my face when people go out of their way to help animals in need. I used to volunteer at a shelter her ein my city. I love helping out rescued animals.",
            "That's commendable. If I had saw this though, I doubt I would've done anything. Most people would only go as far as complaining on social media. While this guy is having diplomatic talks with three different countries while navigating missiles and manages to rescue the animals!",
            "Yea that guys is legit going the distance. Truely a champion. It takes a lit of courage and resolve to go through all of that. I have never personally gone out and rescuded the animals, but I always groomed them, fed them, and made sure they could find a great home. I don't think I could pull a rescue operation in a warzone. I'd for sure crumble under the stress.",
            "You must've really wanted to adopt some of those animals too. It's so easy to get attached to them! And who knows, if America was a warzone, maybe you would've done something similar like this guy.",
            "I did adopt one actually haha! Best dog I've ever had. His owner had left him abandoned in a shed with no food for 3 weeks. Apparently used to beat him because he gets scared if you raise your hands. was really a mess when he came in but now hes the happiest boy you've ever seen.",
            "Yeah, I've read about cases like that so often on Imgur. You just give them a little love and they are whole new animals.",
            "Oh yea a little bit of tlc goes a long way. Animals just wanna live and be loved.",
            "And the sad thing is, even if you mistreat a dog so badly...They will still forgive you. And animal's ability to forgive far exceeds a humans.",
            "Yea it is really sad. A dog will always be loyal. A blessing but also a curse. I can't imagine why anyone would want to hurt this dog; he is so sweet. But then again I can't see why anyone would abuse an animal. It's just wrong on so many levels.",
            "Some people are so wounded inside that the only way they can cope is to wound something else, that is equally as powerless. Anyway, I hope that tiger is still roaming that sanctuary today. Also it would be nice if the guy from the article manages to set up that animal area in the Gaza strip that the article mentioned. It was nice talking to you.",
            "Yea I hope that tiger can live out the rest of it's days peacefully. And likewise!",

            "yea,i can imagine how terrible the conditions must be",
            "Yea. I wonder why they haven't tried doing anything about it yet honestly. It is clearly a problem.",
            "i guess they are just worried about the implications of seemingly \"Allowing\" the migrants,so they are stuck in this dangerous quasi place where the migrants have the incentive but are still unsure enough where it's not 100 percent sure thing",

            "i guess that's a big issue,the offical immigration process itself...my parents immigrated from croatia and from what they've told me, i know it isn't the easiest thing in the world",
            "Yea the process is hard, and long. I guess that is why people just try to sneak in. Sometime sthey can't afford to wait for all the red tape.",

            "The migrant situation all around the world seems to be in shambles but having 4,000+ people go missing in one area should not ever happen.",
            "Yeah, it's a shame. There must be a safer way to transport these people than them having to take their chances on an overcrowded boat.",
            "I can imagine that would not be difficult. Seems like this stems from a larger view that people have against immigration at this time.",
            "I'm not certain this has anything to do with immigration because the countries they are fleeing to will accept them. Even the coyotes or whoever these people are paying to transport them to different countries are misleading them. As in the article, it said that the leaders of these trips are saying that if you get saved, they will take you back to Libya.",
            "I guess there are limited paths that can be taken from Africa where I guess they are fleeing. A land path would be a lot safer but I do not think countries would allow these immigrants to travel through them. That is why I said it was an immigration problem.",
            "Yeah, that's true. I didn't consider that. I think a land trip would be even more perilous. It would take longer and the already poor people would need more supplies. And how are they going to carry those supplies?",
            "I'm not sure. I guess they would need assistance. Rather than being transported on boats, buses or trains could be used.",
            "As mentioned in the article regarding the rescue boats, I think the responsibility of transporting these people should go to the country that's willing to accept them. I don't think the cost would be that exorbitant.",
            "I can't imagine any country willing to take on that task. I can imagine that a lot of the citizens would voice opposition. Most reports that I have seen speak of citizens barely wanting to accept migrants let alone foot the bill for transportation.",
            "That doesn't make sense, as the countries that receive these people are going to pay their living costs for years. Coming off that boat, these people will only have the clothes on their back. They will likely also need to be taught the local language. The big problem with immigration is the government in on the hook for the needs of the people for a long time.",
            "Pay their total living costs for years to come? I would imagine that these people will be able to contribute towards their cost of living with skills and labor. The government being on the hook is my point exactly when I say that the host country's citizens are against this. I see way more reports about opposition to immigration compared to acceptance.",
            "Some people will likely be educated enough to support themselves. I think the majority would need assistance for quite a while. Housing assistance, education assistance, food assistance ect will be required for these people to survive. A few years ago Germany offered to pay migrants a full years worth of rent costs to return home. They also offered to give a lump sum for the migrants to open a business in their home country. This migration and the costs assorted with it are why some Europeans are electing conservative politicians. It's entirely why brexit happened, as the EU was forcing countries to accept migrants.",
            "Exactly why I say that the larger problem/major cause as to why over 4k people have been lost is due to the larger view many have against immigration. Many of these people would be able to perform basic labor jobs. They could benefit the host country's rather than be a drain if utilized correctly.",
            "4k people have been lost because the people are desperate. And even if the boat idea doesn't seem like a good one, they will take that chance anyway. Some countries have problems with immigration but others, like Germany, are still accepting people with open arms. The EU in general is still pro immigration. And a country is going to accept those people that would've arrived on the boat. The problem is that there isn't a safe way to transport poor people. They can't simply buy a plane ticket. And I think you're underestimating how difficult it will be for these people to assimilate. Maybe it's different in others places but I highly doubt I could get a job anywhere if I couldn't speak the language.",
            "I would hope that the earlier migrants would be able to help people assimilate or they can create mini communities as we have in the USA. These things take time I guess and the EU is in the beginning stages in some country's. I guess I underestimate the difficulty as I see tons of immigrants in the US find work when they arrive.",
            "Yeah, it's easier to assimilate here as no matter what ethnicity you are, there's pockets of that group of people living together in every major city.",
            "I think private businesses offering transportation may be able to lessen the deaths during the migration rather than depend on governments.",
            "Maybe if it was a massive, massive company like Apple or Amazon. Even then, I doubt it would happen if the company was publicly traded. They'd get rid of that CEO ASAP. It would have to be the government as they would rightfully take losses to protect the lives of people. I don't think it's that crazy to ask the EU to help transport these people. Unless the representatives of the countries are only virtue signaling and don't actually want to accept the people.",
            "Optimally it would be private company's paid for by the governments so I guess that would be the same as the EU paying the bill/taking on the responsibility.",
            "That sounds like a good solution. I'm hoping that the article was a bit old and migrants aren't drowning as often now-a-days. It was nice talking to you, have a good night. bye",

            "I think it is a greatidea to host an exhibit to try and educate people on what these migrants have to go through. It saddens me though that people have to go through struggles like this and drop everything though just to escape with their lives to a better place.",
            "I agree it's terrible. Do you think you can really teach empathy though?",
            "Hmm I'm not sure. You can teach/mimic the feelings that these people got hrough; but that doesn't mean for certain that someone will still feel empathy towards them.",
            "I agree. I think it doesn't matter how much you teach someone empathy, if they were born with no empathy.. i'm not sure if these classes will change them.",
            "Yea some people just do not care about their fellow man no matter what. It is still good though to expose the general populous to the lives of these people though; Some education never hurts.",
            "I agree. What do you think about allowing some of thse people in the US?",
            "Well first of all I think we need to reform the official immigration process. It is a lot of red tape and waiting etc. That's why people just try to sneak in all the time. But as long as they are productive members of society I see no problem with immigration.",
            "It's pretty sad watching the news and seeing all these families being separated. :(",
            "Yea it really is. Totally messed up. I can't imagine how traumatic that is for a child, let alone their parents.",
            "Yeah, the conditions they're keeping these children in when detained.. terrible",
            "It's just really messed up when you start treating actual people like less than human.",
            "Seriously, we have no right to treat others that way. These people are still human at the end of the day.",
            "Exactly. These are real people, just like us. But of course our president doesn't see that all he sees are colours in his crayon box that he doesn't like.",
            "Let's hope the future changes for the better. So you do think that we should have a class that specifically teaches empathy?",
            "Well again I don't think you can teach empathy; but just educate people on the experiences and feelings of others.",
            "That's a good idea. Nothing wrong with putting the good out there.",
            "Yea like I said earlier, a little education never hurts. Not everyone will give a damn but the decent people will.",
            "I wonder if there's anyway we can help these immigrants",
            "Well a better immigration policy would probably help. If they could go through the official process easier they wouldn't have to sneak in and risk their lives.",
            "Let's hope our next president looks more into this issue. Well it was nice talking to you!",

            "Hmm.. Not sure. Like I know plenty of responsible younger people who drive safe; and Plenty of older people who drive safe. Maybe there needs to be more education on just how much your driving impacts others? Although some poeple just don't care at the end of the day which is kinda messed up.",

            "I lost one of my best friends in high school in a car accident. A man had a heart attack and hit her car killing her and two others.",

            "It's hard to tell, wouldn't the evidence be overwhelmingly obvious?",
            "Yeah I guess I am always wondering about how situations like these can be avoided.",
            "I guess by not driving recklessly and paying attention while you're driving. If it had been street racing, I'm assuming the racing car would've been going really fast and that would've affected the accident.",
            "Yeah for everyone to die in both cars, the other car must have been going extremely fast. It just sucks that you can be like the Mother in this case, make no mistakes and still die.",
            "Wasn't there one or two survivors in the van? And depending on how the van was (lacking safety features), you could probably die after an accident while going 60 mph.",
            "I believe they all died. The mother the two younger children and the teenager. The other two definitely died in the VW. Sure I guess You could die in an accident going 60 mph. However I've been in one of those and walked away without a scratch. I dont think that could have been the case in this one",
            "I think I read that a relative survived the crash, I could've been mistaken. Anyway, I think it probably wasn't street racing. Police are used to estimating speeds due to skid marks and the damages to the vehicles. Although it's possible that the VW was flooring it and lost control before going that fast. And I've found that accidents are semi random and the damage to you has more to do with how you react (less damage if you didn't react). I hit a huge buck at 50 mph or so and completely totaled my car but didn't have a scratch on me. I've been in a minor accident as a passenger and I didn't feel good for a couple days.",
            "Youre right actually Two people out of the five in the van survived, which is everyone except his wife and two children. That's so horrible. I think head on collisions are worse also because the cars are moving in the opposite direction which increasing the impact.",
            "Do you think the survivors felt guilty at all? It's such a unique circumstance. And yeah, head on collisions are the worst.",
            "I think the Husband felt guilty, maybe that he wasn't there or wasn't the one driving. I don't think the survivors felt guilty, probably just lucky that they were in the right seat.",
            "I don't know...if I was in that circumstance, I would probably keep asking myself why this happened. Why didn't I ask if we could leave later or drive to a different location instead? There would be a million what if questions in my head. And why was I spared?",
            "Would you feel guilty though? Would you ask why them and not you?",
            "Yeah, basically. I haven't actually been in the situation so maybe there wouldn't be any guilt. From watching movies though, whenever this kind of thing happens, the main character always wishes that they somehow delayed the person who ended up killed. And if they had managed to do so, then the beloved person would still be alive.",
            "Yeah I could see that. I would just be depressed and feel so fragile because I just saw two people die and the only difference was probably a feet or two between us.",

            "I don't think you can say it's ALWAYS sad, as there's plenty of circumstances in which a divorce is healthy for all parties involved.",
            "I'd say that even in the situations where it's the healthiest for all parties, it's still sad that it came to that.  But I understand your point.",
            "I only slightly cared about the article was my parents were divorced when I was around 8 or 9. Like you said though, they are much older than I was, so they should be able to cope better.",
            "I'm sorry to hear your parents divorced.  How did you view their divorce then and how do you view it now?  Do you think it was for the best?",
            "I was crushed by it as a child. As an adult though, I think it was a good idea. I just didn't understand the differences they had as a child. I tried to ignore the numerous arguments everyday.",
            "I thought the article was pretty glib about it all, focusing more on the fact that the day is apparently hot.  Then again, it was TMZ.",
            "Yeah, stellar journalism lol. The article being brief was probably the point. This is a study afterall.",
            "Not that it matters, but I wonder about the circumstances regarding this type of divorce.  I can understand couples with kids and, you know, 8 years into marriage discovering that they can't keep doing it.  But 27 years, with adult kids.  That I don't readily comprehend.   I guess he got bored or something.",
            "I honestly think humans aren't meant for these long term relationships. No matter how great your spouse/girlfriend is, you will tire of her eventually. And the reasons that they annoy you will keep multiplying until you ask yourself what the point of this relationship is.",
            "Yeah.  I also wonder how much being on the periphery of fame and fortune influences things.  You see a lifestyle that's more tempting but that you can't really participate in.  I wonder if that leads people to more strongly feel a desire for \"more\" and it's easier to be discontent with what you have.",
            "I think fame and money just means more opportunities to cheat. Most guys that have been married 20-30 years probably don't have that many opportunities with attractive younger people.",
            "Yeah, there's no question that opportunity is a huge part of that, and attraction in general.  We're sort of attracted to \"best available,\" whoever that is.  When your rich and famous daughters improve your \"best available\" I can see how it would be easy to stray.",
            "It also brings excitement. When an attractive girl comes into your life, whether its because she works with you or she's a friend of a friend, everything gets more exciting. You care about whether you wore nice looking clothes and whether your haircut is on point. The chase is probably the most exciting part of life.",
            "Yeah, it pretty much all boils down to chasing trim.",
            "Our base needs are basically that and filling our stomachs lol.",
            "Yeah.  Just to be clear, I wasn't making fun of you.  I agree that these are biological drives we can't ignore.  I was just stating that in a glib way.",
            "Oh, I didn't even consider that you were possibly making fun of me. I'm easy going, even if you had been, I wouldn't care. When people divorce after a long marriage, do you think they have another partner already in mind?",
            "Certainly could be.  But I think there are other people who are just looking to go explore.  But I'd be surprised if people left a long-term marriage without the intent of finding someone else.  Like, just to go be alone.  That would surprise me.",
            "If they just wanted to be alone, they probably grew to detest their long-term partner. What's interesting is that even though my dad hated my mom during the divorce and for years later, now they are on speaking terms. Time heals all wounds I guess. Anyway, it was nice talking to you, have a good day.",

            "It's crazy. I can't imagine dying because of some toxic smoke. Not only can you be killed by suffocation, but if you survive down the line you could get cancer. Totally not cool",
            "Yeah, what the heck?? And infants are most vulnerable which is also truly terrible.",
            "Was the smoke toxic from pollution or was it because of what was burning?",
            "I think it was from what was burning but I'm not entirely clear.  Either way, it seemed like the people couldn't avoid it bc it was in the air so they were basially helpless",
            "Yea and it''s not like you can hold your breath forever. 100k though, that is so many people. Way too much death for sure.",
            "yeah exactly, like there was nothing they could do.  And yeah that is a tremendous amount, like that could wipe out an entire city.  what on earth",
            "That's legit a small town. Grief and suffering on an unimaginable scale. It is really sickening. I wonder if there will be better precautions in the future so this doesn't happen again.",

            "I'd hope so. A repeat of this would be even more tragic.",
            "Yeah, I got the feeling this was an ongoing thing that kept happening each year, maybe not on such a large scale but still happening",
            "Man that is messed up if so. Death is death.You would think some government agency or company would step in and try to prevent accidents like this from happening.",
            "Yeah you would think so.  I feel quite certain something like that that was killing 100,000 people at a time would not fly in the United States.",
            "Well Cali has a ton of wildfires, but they actively fight those every year.",
            "Yeah definitely, I think we are pouring a lot of resources into preventing them.  Plus did they cause that many people to die?  I know there were some deaths but I didn't think it was on quite as grand of a scale.",
            "I think maybe like 300-400 last year? but no not on the scale of these chemical fires.",
            "Yeah that is still a lot of lives to lose though.  I guess we are pouring resources into fighting them like you said but I'm not sure about prevention or if anything could be done to prevent those.  I thought they were somewhat of a natural occurrence.",
            "Well yea lightning can strike and start a fire, so can some stupid camper who didnt put out their campfire; or a person throwing a cigarette out the window of their car. I don't think you can prevent them 100% but maybe if people do not do silly thing you could prevent like 50% of the fires.",
            "Yeah you are right my friend!  Careless mistakes like that can be highly costly even to the extent of people's lives.  Well it has been a pleasure discussing this with you, I hope you have an enjoyable afternoon.  goodbye",
            "Yea very good convo. Have a great rest of the workday random turker! Goodbye!"

            "Nope no basement. Only boarded up windows and doors.",
            "Scary! I would've evacuated asap. I've seen too many rescue videos because people were too stubborn to leave. Good thing it ended up going ok though!",
            "Yup. Interesting fact, houses in FL don't have basements because of the hurricanes and flooding. Also, it was nice talking to you! bye!",
            "Yeah, I knew some sections of the country didn't have basements. They are nice though!! And nice talking to you too! bye"

            "I was confused about that since an orphanage was mentioned. I was not sure whether it was a child or a rhino",
            "I think it was some kind of animal sanctuary. Probably in a poor place too, as they didn't have power in their facility.",
            "That does not sound like much of a sanctuary. Why would rhinos need power anyway?",
            "I guess for heating? The person in the article was trying to wrap the baby rhino with blankets to keep its body temperature high. Also power would help with treating these animals.",
            "What kind of treatment do you think they need?",
            "I'm not sure, as the article didn't go that in depth. The baby rhino probably could've been saved from whatever it was ailing from. Whatever it was, it killed the rhino after it fought for life for 48+ hours.",
            "What do you think the cause of death was?",
            "I haven't the slightest idea. Maybe some kind of rare disease?",
            "I was thinking disease as well. Most infant animals die from disease if not predation. How old do you think the rhino was?",
            "I think it was really young, I don't quite remember specifics though. I think it had a 2 in there, so either 2 days/months/years old.",
            "What do you think a baby rhino smells like?",
            "Probably a bit more musty than what a human baby smells like. What do you think? Also rhino's are such cool creatures, I remember seeing them at the Philly zoo. Have you ever seen one in person?",
            "No I have never seen one in person. It pains me to think of all the poaching they are at risk for",
            "Yup, poaching semi-defenseless animals is such a disgusting thing. The only plus side is that I think rhinos grow their horn back if it's damaged or cut off by poachers.",
            "I did not know that. I think that is what they are mainly poached for. If they do grow it back, why not farm them instead?",
            "I think it's an ethical thing. Also most people have no use for rhino horns. It's only Asian medicine techniques that require them for good health or whatever.",
            "Yes Asia is the main market, which is why the horns are so valuable. I am sure scientist have established that there are no benefits from rhino horns but people still believe in fairy tales.... and rhinos still get poached",
            "Yeah, it's a really unfortunate situation. Hopefully younger people in those areas grow up with more appreciation towards exotic animals and no longer purchase these kinds of things. It was nice talking to you.",
            "I agree hopefully the internet can help educate and create awareness. I am still wondering how a rhino can become orphaned? What do you think?",
            "I guess the easiest way would be if poachers killed the mother/father rhino. Do you know if father rhinos care for the young rhinos too?",
            "No I don't, but I don't expect that they do. In most mammals the females exclusively raise the young. I wonder how they orphans are discovered initially?",
            "I guess some people must've stumbled on the young rhino. Similar to when kittens and puppies are sent to shelters. Also the rhino might've not been orphaned, it could've just been born in the animal sanctuary.",
            "That makes sense. How long do you think a baby rhino can last in the wild without its mother?",
            "They are herbivores, so they don't need to \"hunt\" for food like other meat eaters. So they would have sustenance, it's just a matter of surviving other predators until they are tough enough to protect themselves. I don't think many young animals survive without their mothers.",
            "Yeah I was wondering how long they would be able to avoid predators. Without their mothers they are pretty much defenseless. I would really like to see one in person they seem like majestic creatures. Do they have good temperaments??",
            "They are wild animals, so I imagine they would be unpredictable. If you don't intrude on their space, I don't think they would attack you needlessly.",
            "They seem aggressive to me, why else would they have that huge horn?",
            "I guess for defense mostly, since they don't even eat meat. Also maybe as a way of getting mates somehow? Anyway, it was nice talking to you. bye",

            "Do you think the campaign to end the guardianship system in Saudi Arabia will be successful?",
            "I hope it will. I think it is really messed up how women are treated over ther ein that culture. No one should be treated as property. Plus theya re their own person; why do they need the permission of a man do so like literally anything?",
            "I don't think we should criticize their culture after viewing it through a lens of our own. I also don't believe women are treated more in a cherubic sensed as property. I would say they are regarding more",
            "You make a valid point that is pretty unfair of me to apply my values onto them in that way.",
            "What do you think about the women who support guardianship? What is your impression of them?",
            "I'm not sure. Like i guess they are used to the set ways over there, or they just aren't bothered by it. I mean at the end of the day it is their choice to go along with it or oppose it, and since they are okay with it I guess it would be wrong of me to judge them for that since they are the primary party effected by the rule.",
            "I agree that is their choice. I sincerely hope some compromise can be reached because it does appear that there are some women who are dissatisfied. I worry about how this movement will affect relations between Saudis and westerners",
            "Yea. Like my first impression was bad for sure because I immediately looked at things from like, our culture's point of view. I didn't think about it from their perspective. Which makes me kinda look like an ***hole. I hope things work out ok though for both parties of women over there though. Pollitical reform is always a hard road to travel. I hope that some positive progress is made.",
            "Do you know much about Saudi Arabia's history?",
            "Personally no, all I know is that there is a lot of conflict in that area and there has been for a while. Please enlighten me if you can; I am always open to learning new things",
            "Well the short version is this: the first king of Saudi Arabia united the peninsula by warring with some tribes and allying with others. Classic Game of Thrones stuff. However in order to win his campaign he decided to ally himself with the Wahhabis. They were known for being particular good soldiers, but there was one catch: they are extremely orthodox and they made him promise that the new kingdom would follow their religious ideology. The new king began trading oil with the west and opened Saudi Arabia to westerners culturally and economically. The Wahhabis did not like this and they have been expressing their frustration about it in many ways for years, sometimes violently.",
            "Oh wow. I did not know any of that. That explains why their ways over there seem like they are set in stone; because the pretty much kinda are.",
            "Yes, the king made a promise he could not keep and the rest is history. Western culture has been slowly becoming more popular through trade, media, and now the internet. The traditionalist have been getting angrier and angrier about it over the years and I am concerned that this new movement will enflame these tensions. If that happens I don't think the west will be insulated from it.",
            "You know that kinda reminds me about all the church groups here that really hare lgbt and leftist pollitical ideals here in the south. So in that regard the traditionalists there and here aren't that different.",
            "Yeah they might read different books but they are pretty much the same, but the traditionalist in Saudi Arabia have a lot more money and sometimes fund extremism.",
            " I don't think extremism is ever good but that's just me. I hate violence. I don't think it is right to hurt people over beliefs. I'm sure there are groups here though that also fund violence. How does the KKK get all of it's funding? Someone's gotta be donating to them right?",
            "Maybe you are right. I hope that the Saudis can find some compromise, but if our culture is causing tensions between them maybe we should just back off. I would like whatever outcome allows us both to coexist peacefully. What do you think?",
            "Of course. Coexistance is what we need. We don't need to try to constantly police everything over there for sure.",
            "Yea I agree. Do you think guardianship will ever change or be abolished?",
            "I mean anything is possible. It just might take some time. Hopefully no violence comes out of it though.",
            "It seems like the opposition to it has been peaceful so far. Let's see how long that lasts. I found it interesting that the article mentioned there were women who support guardianship. I was hoping to hear more about them and why the support it",
            "Yea it would be interesting to hear more from their side about it. It's always nice to gain an understanding of both sides.",
            "Why do you think some Saudi women might be in favor of guardianship?",
            "Maybe they don't want to \"rock the boat.\" Or maybe they are just used to the system the way it is and don't mind it. I wish we could ask them.",
            "Good points. I was also curious what some of the Saudi men had to say about the issue but the article did not mention it",
            "Yea it would be intersting to know now many men are willing to end the system.",
            "What do you think they might say about it?",
            "I'm not sure. On the one half, you have the men who want to keep everything the same, and on the other there may be some who think that the women deserve a little more freedom on what they do. I'm sure there's plenty of arguing on both sides. Just like there is here about lgbt issues.",
            "Yes I am sure there is much debate. The article mentioned they were also discussing changing some aspects of guardianship. What changes do you think could be made that would ameliorate the concerns of some Saudi women?",
            "Hmm. Not entirely sure. Maybe they could reduce the senarios where they would need permission from a man to do things? Like working or studying.",
            "That might be a good place to start. This has been a great conversation. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day. bye",
            "Likewise! have a great rest of the workday random turker! bye!"

            "I found it to be incredibly frustrating and sad, i think it is a shame that more is not being done to protect that forest and more importantly the Orangutan that call it home.",
            "I agree. I can't believe that people get to make money off of destroying nature.",
            "Exactly, and whats even more questionable is the lack of action from the Indonesian government. Almost like people have just decided it is okay if certain species go extinct.",
            "While I was reading the article I started thinking that the Indonesian government must be getting some sort of financial incentive to ignore the destruction.",
            "More likely than not. Even though it shouldn't be necessary maybe if only there were tax incentives or something for these companies if they are helpful with the environment.",
            "That's a great idea. I don't know what will make companies stop destroying the earth. Nothing seems to be working.",
            "Yeah i don't think they will stop until we are actually at the brink, or stopping makes them more money of course.",
            "Have you ever seen an orangutan in real life? It is unreal how human like they seem. I kept thinking about that while reading the article, they must be so scared.",
            "Never had the chance myself but that is even more chilling, it is very easy to forget just how intelligent these animals really are. It doesn't make sense how people could look at the animals that are affected and not think maybe we shouldn't do this.",
            "I feel like sadly it is only going to get worse because right now a lot of the world is refusing to believe they are destroying the earth.",
            "I agree, i actually don't think it is possible for it to get better before it gets worse. People need to actually see the outcome of there actions before they can change.",
            "I know this is kind of morbid, but I feel like maybe all the scientists are right and we really only have a certain number of years left before we kill the earth. Feels like they are getting close to cutting all the trees down at least.",
            "They have to be getting close, and i believe it honestly. With how much pollution that has occured for the sake of greed i pray that we are able to change before the we finish the job on the earth.",
            "It would be nice to see some sort of group created that has the power to punish all countries that allow stuff like this to happen.",
            "I agree, almost like a united nations for environmental protection. Where the largest countries come together and ensure that change begins to occur. But that wont happen with so many people currently in power denying the issue.",
            "I know, here in America is feels like the government wants to destroy the environment. Maybe everyone in power is getting paid to keep quiet about he issues",
            "They are definetely making a ton of money on keeping quiet and ignoring the issue. My big hope is maybe all this greed and innovation leads to the renewable energies like wind and solar starting to pay off big for us and maybe we start to phase out oil.",
            "I hope so, it makes so much more sense. I think sometimes nothing is going to change because so many people are afraid of new technology",
            "I agree, but it is either accept new technology and change or watch as the world just gets worse and worse in the coming years",
            "Lets hope that doesnt happen! It was nice to meet you, have a great day. goodbye",
            "Yeah lets hope, and nice to meet you also. goodbye."

            "I think the whole trigger happy law enforcement situation in America is kinda messed up. What do you think?",
            "I agree. I think it is completely out of hand. It is a hard situation to fix though, so many people think the police can do no wrong.",
            "For real. I live in the south and minorities are profiled constantly. An officer was just removed from the force in Chattanooga because he profiled a man just sitting on his porch and ende dup shooting the poor guy and his dog.",
            "I can't even imagine what it must be like to be black and have to deal with the cops I would be so scared all the time. I never realized how lucky I was in all my dealings with the police in my life.",
            "Yea around here if you are white the cops don't care unless you are dealing drugs. It is pretty sad that I can wlak alone at 3am and they dont care but as soon as they see a black guy hes getting searched.",
            "There was a big case here in New York, some poor guy was selling bootleg cigarettes on the corner in New York City and the cops arrested him. The guy was kind of big I guess and they were scared of him so they wound up choking him to death. For selling illegal cigarettes. The cops got to keep their jobs too I think. White people here mostly think the cops are perfect so nothing will ever change",
            "Around here everyone doesn't like cops. They are shady. There have meen many cases of them being removed from the force; plus cases of people impersonating them to do messed up stuff. Oh and the excessive force.",
            "It's good that they are at least being held accountable. Know what really blows my mind, is that until a few years ago when the Trayvon Martin case happened, no one even knew these things were happening. I never would have believed that cops were murdering black people for no reason. It's so crazy that  everyone ignored what was happening",
            "Yea people tend to ignore things when it isn't happening to them personally or when it is swept under the rug. I just wish we as a whole weren't so prejudice towards eachother. It's dumb we're all people who cares about what ethnicity we are.",
            "I agree. It just seems to be getting worse. There are so many people who I would have sworn were not racist, and now they very clearly are. I guess they were all in hiding waiting until they felt safe enough acting racist. It's terrible. I don't know how it can't be fixed",
            "Yea lately there seems to be these emerging polar opposite sides in society. And both sides take things too far. Violence isn't the answer people. Ghandi and MLK did a ton without ever raising a hand against anyone. Things now adays are getting so far out of hand with all these shootings and riots.",
            "I always think about what would happen if everyone just went blind tomorrow. We wouldn't be able to see what anyone looked like. We would actually have to judge people on meaningful things other than their skin tone of their body shape. I mean obviously it would be terrible to not be able to see, but its interesting to think about.",
            "If only we could actually act like that. Here in the south it is disgusting how people act towards eachother. I hear nbombs constantly. People always judge you by how you look. Especially the older people. They can be the worst. I remember being in a grocery store once and an older man wouldn't go through the checkout line unless it was a white girl ringing him up. caused a big scene voer something so stupid.",
            "Wow that is so obnoxious. It is amazing people like that have made it this long without getting into a ton of fights everywhere they go",
            "I know right? God cops though of all people need to practice being non biased. They're supposed to protect people not shoot up people because of their skin color.",
            "What do you think would even help the situation at this point?",
            "I'm not sure. It really just comes down to us human beings not being trash. Maybe some stricter laws or soemthing pertaining to when you can actually shoot someone as a cop. But yea i really don't know.",
            "I agree. People really are terrible. Hopefully as all the older people leave this planet the younger people can act differently, but it isn't looking too promising",
            "Yea. I don't wish death on the older people but theya re so stuck in their ways that I don't think we can make positive change until 20ish years in the future..",
            "Well I meant as they die naturally, I dopnt",
            "Oh haha sorry I misunderstood. Anyway it's been a great convo random turker! Have a great rest of the day c: goodbye!",
            "Sorry my last message got cut off because I pressed enter too soon ! Have a great day. goodbye"

            "Yeah, It makes me think about how much food my family waste.",
            "Yes! Oh man, exactly. I feel like in America it's so easy just to throw away something because it's \"expired\" but really any one in any other country would still use those products.",
            "My children are so picky of what they will eat or won't eat, but it is hard for them to understand how other children in the world are feeling.",
            "Yeah, that is a really tough concept to teach to kids. I'm lucky that mine are young enough to not know any different",

            "I agree. No child should go hungry. Like you said there are a lot of countries out there with a lot of hungry children. It is sad to think about.",
            "It really is. I feel like we don't even realize how many countries actually struggle. But at the end of the day, how can we know for sure that the money or organizations we donate to are using the money properly? It's hard.",

            "I sometimes wonder how far have we gotten away from loving life without having to have a lot of unnecessary things.",
            "Yes. It's a materialistic world these days. I wonder how different it may be in these other countries. I would love to travel and see it first hand because you'd really be able to emphasize with them more.",
            "I agree. Technology is a good and bad thing. I think we are more detached now days.",
            "Very much so. It really is a blessing and a curse. I really think that some aspects have improved from technology but our interactions with others have decreased.",
            "Would you donate more if you knew 100 percent went to the people that needed it. I would.",
            "Yes oh yeah. I don't trust organizations enough currently.",
            "Plus a lot of them have a lot of overhead.",
            "Exactly. They have to get paid too so where does that money come from?",
            "I also thing is it better to set up systems to improve peoples life not  only just give them food or money.",
            "Yes yes yes. Because even if you were to give them money or food, the issue will repeat again and again. Especially if there is corruption with the government in those places.",
            "I would like to travel to different countries like you said. See things first hand.",
            "Yes. I think also going to those places and helping first hand is more helpful too.",
            "Do you have any other thoughts about the article?",

            "Well, I think we need more information.  I read a different article about the Calais camp and it gave a different story.  The refugees were apparently causing problems there, and it got out of hand.  I don't really know what to think.  I feel sad for children who suffered.  What did you think?",
            "That is interesting that there might be another side to this article, it didn't really elude to that",
            "Yeah no it did not.  It seemed a bit biased to me.  But regardless, it certainly sounds like the situation got out of hand.  The camp couldn't be supported and there wren't enough resources there.  I know it became a big problem for the French government.  They had to clear it all out.",
            "It does seem a bit biased, like they are trying to pull at our sympathy. How did the French government handle it?",
            "Yes, that was my take on it too.  They cleared the camp out!  It was causing too many problems. IT took several attempts and the refugees protested, burned things, threw rocks, etc., the typical rioting behavior.  But eventually they were put out and I think most went to other countries or areas and carried on.",
            "That's crazy... so it seems like both parties could be at fault",
            "yes that was my thoughts",
            "It's weird that this had a biased article. All the ones I've done have seemed not so",
            "I think I may have encountered a few that seemed biased.  I actually read another article on here about Calais camp and it was a little less biased.  It certainly didn't use the word \"abusive\".",
            "Interesting... Either way... the kids is what get me. They did nothing and do not deserve what is happening to them/going on around them",
            "Yes I think it is sad for the kids, too.  innocents.  they kinda made it out like it was just a bunch of kids, though.  accoring to another article it was 62% med aged 33 on average",
            "Interesting... I think their banking on the kids aspect is what's grabbing peoples attention and putting the sympathy vote on them",
            "I meant to say \"men\", but yeah I agree.  It seems like they only covered part of the story.  But all bias aside, I do think it is sad for the children who were there.  I wonder how old they were?  like teens or little kids?",
            "Probably a mix of both... Can you imagine growing up in that kind of tramau?",
            "It would be terrible, and the other article said a lot of the children were unaccompanied, so where were the parents??",
            "Oh no I hope they aren't dead...",
            "yeah that would be very sad, I guess it is possible",
            "That or they are not there for their children, which is sad as well",
            "Yeah good point, that is equally tragic.  Well I must go, thanks for the talk!  bye",

            "It's always so hard to imagine these countries and the struggle they are experiencing. I wouldn't want to be in their situation and count my blessings. What about you?>",
            "Same here.   All I can picture was the 70 year old man saddened and weak.   Everything he worked so hard for was gone and he had to stay.",
            "Exactly. I can't even imagine. Especially that old to have lost it all.",
            "I know.   I volunteer at an at-risk youth center in the city.   The majority of the kids I work with are refugee families.   We have no idea how blessed we are.",
            "Yes that's very true. It's hard for me to imagine. Youth these days have it so much more difficult than us.",
            "These youth are from Syria, Jordan, Sudan, Ethiopia.   They all came from the countries this story is conveying.",
            "Oh wow. That hits home for you then. I just can't even imagine how they feel. I'm sure you deal with the anger and sadness from them",
            "Not so much anger but more TBI symptoms.   I had to take a lot of classes to understand it in order to be able to work with them.   No one know except them the impact of years of bombing and homes being burned how that permanently affects children.",
            "That's true. I can't imagine wanting to really want to talk about it, especially here in the US. I feel like it's such mixed emotions and opinions.",
            "Another dark part of refugees relocating is there is no one keeping these families together.   Some are here in US, the same family has members in Canada or Brazil.   It's bazaar.",
            "Oh wow. That is bazaar. That just makes matters so much harder. The system is unfortunately not the best.",
            "To me everything is simple.   Example:   US can take 2000 refugees this year.   Why not take a whole family at a time to get to the 2000 ?   It's not rocket science.   My imagination is are they saying you, you, you get to go???",
            "Yeah, just completely random selections to make it seem unbiased maybe? I don't know enough about it apparently because I had no idea it was like that.",
            "Well I didn't either until I started volunteering.   Most come here with absolutely nothing especially shoes.  They walked barefoot for smiles and smiles.   When they finally get here, they have flip flops that were given to them.   I live in Colorado so we have 9 months of snow each year.   I head up a Christmas Shoe sponsorship where families adopt a child and the main purpose is to give them a sturdy pair of athletic shoes.    If they want to give something else, perfectly fine.   We give photos to the families and their children get involved after they see their sweet faces.",
            "Oh wow. That's so tough but so awesome about the sponsorship. It makes it a tad better.",
            "Yes so far I have 560 sponsors.   I still need 20 more for kids and 100 for the adults.  I'll get it.      If you haven't worked as a volunteer to help these folks, I highly recommend.   The parents cannot speak English so the children never have anyone to help them at home.   Tutoring brings them joy as well as you feel like you helped them.",
            "That's so great that you can help them. It's great to hear that people are actually putting valiant efforts into changing something about the struggles. You don't hear it often. I'll definitely look up the organization. What city is it based out of?",
            "It's most everywhere that has a city.  Mine is in Denver - but the refugees are located in most all cities in the US.    It was so nice chatting with you about this topic.   Blessings to you and your family,  goodbye",
            "Thanks again. goodbye."

            "I found the article to be very sad, and anger-inducing. How about you?",
            "Yes, dogs shouldn't be left in cars like that, there should be more responsibility taken here.",
            "Honestly, I feel like the officer should be charged with involuntary manslaughter. They consider police dogs to be police officers. I feel it's important to set a precedent here.",
            "That kind of makes sense, I was not sure whether to believe they suffered consequences at all honestly",
            "They were definitely vague. I think they were on suspended leave, un-paid. But you know, that's pretty messed up if they're not being charged with anything. I feel like negligence like that needs to be severely cracked down on.",
            "yeah, I wonder how realistic that even is though, the consequences always seem vague and small",
            "It's unfortunate, but you're right. That's why I feel like they should be charged with the murder of a police officer. If a criminal were to shoot a police dog, they would be charged with murdering an officer. But a cop gets away with leaving the dog in the cop car? I mean, ugh. That's really aggravating.",
            "would they really be charged with that? That definitely seems hypocritical",
            "I hope they're charged with involuntary manslaughter of a police officer. I swear, if you set a harsh punishment, you'll deter people, and make them think twice. Same goes for anyone leaving anything/anyone in a car.",
            "That makes sense, but the difficulty would be convincing the local prosecutor to take on the case, and the rest of the police force to be willing to provide evidence",
            "You would think that there shouldn't be much evidence to provide. I don't think it would go that far, unfortunately, but I feel like it should. If it were a legit  human, I wonder what would happen from there.",
            "hm, I'm not sure. In any case there should also be procedures for making sure that doesn't happen in the first place",
            "There should be. I just hate hearing stories about deaths caused by cars due to negligence. I would love to see that cop do ten years for the death of that police dog. Sorry, this story gets me steamed.",
            "that's a lot of years, but perhaps he deserves it.",
            "I think so. If his partner was a human, or there was someone handcuffed in the back, and he/she left them there, and they died, everyone would be flipping out. A lot of people don't feel the dog's life is worth as much as a person's, and like I said, we need to set a precedent here to deter problems like this to begin with.",
            "I wonder if a policy like that would cause them to stop using dogs altogether. Maybe that would be for the best, idk",
            "Or maybe the police force would be more careful. I definitely see what you're saying, though. I apologize for getting rant-y about the issue.",
            "no, I think you're being very reasonable. Yeah maybe they would be more careful. They definitely should be.",
            "I'm very liberal in almost all of my views, until it comes to the justice system, then it gets a little more extreme on my end. But yeah, hopefully we can deter behavior like that in the end.",
            "ideally it would be possible. The goal should be preventing things like this from happening to begin with however that can be done most effectively",
            "Right. I think if you set down strict rules about procedures with partners/K9 units, then, hopefully, people will pay more attention. Maybe up the punishment for this situation, and they'll definitely be more careful.",
            "That makes sense. Maybe there could be specific training too? I'm not sure what the best procedure is for making sure dogs are safe in cars in all situations",
            "Yeah, hopefully all of that is already in place. If not, then it should be. Well, I can't think of anything else. My rant steamed out ha ha",

            "I think its at least a good sign that they are trying to find a solution.",
            "I agree. There are so many things this article brings up in me. I think the first is the access to vaccines, their use, and extrapolated to my situation as an American - the current anti-vaccine movement. This doctors had to go through hoops to get a vaccine for a dying population, and we take it so much for granted here that we have a significant group of people undermining the entire concept of vaccinations.",
            "Agreed that we take it for granted here, to have some people hate vaccines like they do",
            "I think of my son, who is 8, and the possibility that he will be exposed to something, and it makes me frustrated. Our neighbors and anti-vaccine and they have a peer for my son. I don't think they understand that a vaccine works when the community uses it. When there are people who exempt themselves, it creates problems with the strategy to eradicate a disease. Then I think of these poor kids who are just trying to get through each day. Not only dealing with dirty water, but also no vaccine...",
            "have you heard about the re-emerging diseases because people arent taking vaccines",
            "Absolutely. OK, that neighbor used to work in my office. She quit, then sued us for harrasment because we didn't let her work from home full time after having a baby. THEN she moved in next door and the first thing that happened was that her son got whooping cough - which is in the vaccines. The poor kid looked like death and was still going to school like it was nothing. That was the day I started driving my son to school every day - just in case.",
            "jesus you would think once her kid got that whooping cough she'd realize maybe the vaccines aren't so bad after all. People like that ruin it for the rest of us.",

Certainly on a social level, but I also think a regulated and conscientious welfare system benefits the greater society... but I will be damned if reading a story like this doesn't make me at least understand the feelings of those people who want small government.",
            "I think the people that want small government go to the extremes though. They want basically no government and that would be hard to live without.",
            "Absolutely. I fundamentally believe a truly democratic government would struggle supporting leaders that make these types of decisions in this article.... but then again, we got a Trump, so I don't know...",
            "Oh man I still don't know how Trump got elected...",
            "I felt blindsided that night. I didn't cry, but I was absolutely shocked. And I am really over the \"I told you sos.\" Just for reference, the anti-vax neighbor is also a big Trump supporter hahaha... Anyway. back to the article - I don't understand how an organization like WHO doesn't have more ability to assist in this situation.",

            "Agreed! It's awful. I can't believe they only got 20 years.",
            "That was what i was thinking too, 20 years for scaring your child forever and sexually abusing them. Do you think they have really reconciled with what they did?",
            "No I think if someone is evil enough to do that, that evil can't go away. They may have buried it or learned to hide it, but that is evil at it core.",
            "I agree, it just goes against too many natural instincts that we as humans have. To think that they could look at their child and only see the money that they could gain from it digusts me. And honestly the fact that they even allowed the mother or father to go on the show seems very wrong to me also.",
            "Exactly! Yah that seems like a grab for views which is sad on Dr Phils part. He should have focused on the abusee and trying to help her.",
            "Definitely,  i know that their show is about making money and saying that the abuser and abusee will confront each other is good for views but i just think about how their parents are once again profiting from their childs abuse and it just makes my skin crawl.",
            "Ew that's true, I didn't even think about them profitting. That's even worse. I wonder if the daughter will even think it's worth it at that point",
            "I don't personally see how it could be but if it gets her any closure or helps her then i guess it is fine.",
            "yah thats true",
            "What makes me upset is thinking about why she would even do this in the first place. I can only imagine she needs the money from the show or something cause why face these people.",
            "That's true, usually people with childhood tramua such as that struggle with holding steady jobs and their finances. So she probably doesn't want the whole world to know those secrets but now they do because she needs the money most likely.",
            "maybe she has just come to terms with the experience and now sees it as a paycheck that can also help her get some closure. But yeah that makes sense. I also think it is awful how the mother is claiming it was all the fathers idea and she just gave in to his idea after three months, you don't just become okay with the idea of abusing your child.",
            "True a good mother would like divorce or be strongly against the husband/father for even bringing that up in the first place. I would be beyond disgusted if my husband said anything like that",
            "Exactly or report him to the police or try to get him help, but to give in? Absolutely disgusting and for her to try and just shrug it off as his idea shows she did not learn anything in prison and is still rotten to the core.",
            "Agreed... she is just as at fault as she is. Parents are supposed to protect, not enable or roll over and let evil things happen",
            "Exactly, it really makes me wonder why she was even released from prison if she did not improve or was not rehabilitated in any way  since she clearly doesn't show true remorse.",
            "Yah... Also why, if she was \"less' at fault, did they get the same sentence length? IMO life would have been enough for both. There's no reason people like that need freedom and to have the opportunity to hurt someone else.",
            "I agree there are certain people who cannot be redeemed and crimes that cannot be forgiven and this is definitely one of them.",
            "Agreed. It's been great talking but I think we at 20+ turns right?",

            "i know especially the ones that ran off and just waited in mysery",
            "yah that sounds awful.... I wonder if this could have been preventsed",
            "yeah it sounds like the way these people get gas should be more regulated",
            "I agree... I hope they do something to prevent this happeneing again",
            "yes, me two this was such a mass casuality they need to do something",
            "Agreed... and think of all the people that saw the even happen. I bet they are traumatized.",
            "yes especially the workers that came to help and these people were in so much pain and suffering they must need therapy",
            "hopefully the government or that company offer some.",
            "yeah and some assistance to the families that have lost loved one",
            "Yes for sure... they shouldn't have to pay any of those bills",
            "i agree and i wonder what the town looks like after such a big explosion probably needs to be rebuilt somewhat",
            "that's true... do you think there are laws in place that will make them pay for this? I hope so",
            "no with s place that you randomly get gas on the side of the road from a truck i bet there laws are iffy",
            "that was kind of my thoughts too.... and those people who that happened too were probably not well off...",
            "yeah probably very poor lived a not great life then died suffering so sad",
            "it's awful.... and even worse that with not a lot of laws in place probably, this could happen again and again",
            "yes true i think this should be on the news and some aid should come help and set up laws",
            "agreed. then maybe bigger countries could chime in an help. would you like to keep talking for 5 more turns",
            "yes I would like thar, i think bigger countries have responsibility to guide small poorer countries",
            "i thnk so too because they have the experience",
            "yes and resouces these people dont",
            "exactly. what else could they do to help you think? send like guidance people down",
            "yeah maybe create a task force to aid the social and economical aspect of it",
            "that's a good idea. And we could send them down to prevent events like that not just after them",
            "yup a preventative task force train them and then eventually they will have the tools and knowledge to do it themsleves",
            "that would be great. I wonder if anythign like that is in place already? Probably is but it's not that great",
            "yeah i dont know something needs to be done so this doesnt happen yet again they dont need this death toll with in the society",
            "agreed! it's been nice talking to you goodbye",

            "Right? I thought it would be way worse initially. Still sad but could have been so so much worse",
            "Yeah. I feel like as soon as I hear any bad news these days I immediately brace for the worst.",
            "Same...I wonder what caused it",
            "Oh, I guess it didn't say, did it? That's odd. I feel like a gas leak is usually the suspect.",
            "I dont think so.... and yah that would seem most common. I wonder if anyone will sue the landlord. I would haha",
            "Haha, probably depends on what they can afford, honestly. If only eight people were inside it must have been small.",
            "That's true.... I've always had bad landlords, but if it were a nice guy who I knew I might think twice and just be glad it wasn't worse",
            "Yeah. I feel like it would also depend on how bad my injuries were \u9225?like, are we talking smoke inhalation or 3rd degree burns?",
            "true, it would not be worth it for simple things like some inhalation.",
            "I wonder how the people outside the apartment got hurt. There was an explosion, right? I wouldn't want to get caught in that.",
            "Maybe like debris flying or something like that? It said minor so they probably just got knicked with something",
            "Yeah, I think only one person had to go to the hospital, so the explosion must have happened in an area a decent distance from the inhabitants.",
            "That would make sense yah, which is good. It probably means the building was like set up like it was supposed to be, safety wise and all",
            "Yeah. I wonder if they had to find somewhere else to live, at least while the investigation's underway?",
            "Hopefully they did, i didn't think about that. I hope there is some sort of law or policy in place that the landlord would have to pay for a hotel for them or something",
            "It'd definitely be the respectable thing to do. I wonder if any of the building was salvageable.",
            "Hopefully so... it didn't have much detail on all that. and hopefully not a lot of people's stuff was ruined! that would suck",
            "Ooooh, yeah, that would be awful! Especially if you'd lived there a long time and had lots of memories and stuff. :(",
            "I know! To just have it all be gone in a moment, no warning. That would really really suck, on top of being injured and not having a place to stay.",
            "Eeeep. My worst nightmare :/",
            "Same here....and those things can't be brought back with time or money.",
            "Yeah. :( Well, I think that's about everything... did anything else in the article strike you?",
            "do you want to go for like three more turns to get the bonus? We could talk about insurance on it and stuff",
            "Sure, that's fine! I know most people have to have rental insurance; does that cover fire damage?",
            "When I had mine it did, and it would cover the cost to replace any damaged or destroyed items",
            "That's good, hopefully everyone involved will have that. I wonder if the people just on the street will get anything for health insurance.",
            "I hope so too... I know a lot of my friends who rent don't. Which is silly cause it's like 10 bucks a month. They probably could get it covered by the property owners insurance",
            "Eep, that's not a good idea. Renter's insurance is super cheap comparatively and can save you a lot of heartache. I had a pipe on the washing machine break one time and it flooded the whole floor. No insurance would've been a nightmare.",
            "Oh yes that would have been awful! Even just for the peace of mind it's worth it. I think that is 15 turns. Are you ready to be done?",
            "Yep, I'm good. :) It was great talking with you!",

            "Agreed. I do think some jobs by their nature will have more men than women working them. Like firefighters, If a woman can pass the physical part of the job then she should have it.",

            "I agree with that.",
            "I also think it's sad women aren't advancing in their careers as much as men. All the women i know in power positions work just as hard or harder than their male counterparts",
            "I agree, but this system was not built was everybody in mind so its going to take a while to change it.",
            "Yes... probably longer than everyone would like. It makes me sad as a women in the workforce, trying to advance. ANd I am in Electrical so it's a very male driven workforce",

            "That's not a bad idea... I usually don't follow the use by dates either, I've read they can be scammy, just to get you to buy more",
            "Exactly!   Same thing with medicine.   I have even asked the doctor about expiration dates and he said no such thing.   Big Pharma doing the same thing you noted.   I just want to do something to adjust everyone's thinking but few get on board",

            "That is so sad... With how much food we have, nobody should be going hungry.",
            "It is sad.   The % of American children that go to bed hungry every night makes me sad.  Yet it's never discussed",
            "It's awful... And there's no reason for it. Why can't we donate just a bit of money? Rice and beans, oatmeal. It's all nourishing and cheap",
            "yes it is and ramen.   A few stores here do it only at Thanksgiving or Christmas.   Why is it limited to those?",
            "Right? People need to need every other day of the year too.",
            "And the hunger in the rest of the world is astounding.    Occasionally you will get the sad TV commercial of malnourished kids in Africa, etc. but I don't give to those.   Most of it is given to huge executive salaries (mad face)",
            "I've heard that too... LIke these company's CEOs are millionaires or billionaires",

            "Yes it is - March of Dimes, etc. all the same way.",
            "That's so sad... the rich get richer while the poor continue to suffer and strrve",
