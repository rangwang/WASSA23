Both issues are complex. But our reporting found that the $20 billion to end homelessness and $300 billion to halt global warming would be far from sufficient.\u00a0\nHomelessness\u00a0\nThe $20 billion figure to end homelessness has circulated for years. That number traces back to reporting about an outdated estimate from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in 2012. It\u00a0 was a rough estimate of the annual cost.\nThe number has to do with housing choice vouchers, which are the primary component of federal spending on housing assistance. They are seen by advocates as one of the primary ways the government can address the homelessness crisis.\u00a0\nUnder the housing choice voucher program, renters contribute 30% of their monthly income in rent and the federal government pays the rest, said Jason Ward, an economist and associate director for the RAND Center for Housing and Homelessness in Los Angeles.\nNot everyone who is eligible for housing assistance receives it. Ward estimated that around 7.4 million eligible households are not receiving this aid.\nExpanding the voucher program to cover all those who are eligible would cost well over $20 billion.\nThe average subsidy per voucher holder is around $8,000 a year. Multiply that by 7.4 million, and it would cost at least $59 billion per year to fully fund the voucher program.\nThe government would still need to substantially increase the supply of affordable housing so that the use of vouchers would not reduce the housing supply and raise rents.\u00a0\nCurrent estimates of the costs of building affordable housing in major metropolitan areas range from around $150,000 per unit in Atlanta to a high of $550,000 per unit in Southern California.

{"label": "pants-fire", "claim": "Rick Hardcastle Benzene has \"never been proven to be harmful.\"", "evidence": "During House debate, state Rep. Rick Hardcastle brushed off a colleague\u2019s concerns about benzene emissions near Texas schools. \u00a0\"Are you aware benzene is also a compound in soap?\" Hardcastle said April 28. \"Found at every car wash in this state \u2014 and several other industries in this state? And it\u2019s never been proven to be harmful.\"\n\nThe Vernon Republican was opposing an amendment by Rep. Lon Burnam, D-Fort Worth, that would prohibit the Oil and Gas Commission from issuing drilling permits for gas wells within 1,200 feet from a public school unless they meet a set of conditions, including installing emission controls and ensuring certain pollutants, such as benzene, fall below certain concentrations.\n\nMembers tabled Burnam\u2019s proposal. Still, we wondered if benzene has really never been proven harmful?\n\nFirst, a benzene primer: According to the federal Environmental Protection Agency, benzene is an organic chemical compound found most often in the air as a result of emissions from burning coal and oil, drilling for natural gas or in gasoline vapors, car exhaust, cigarette smoke and other sources. The chemical also is used as a solvent for inks, paint and plastics and to manufacture detergents.\n\nEPA spokesman Joe Hubbard told us benzene is a \"widely used chemical formed from both natural processes and human activities.\" Still, in 1986, the agency classified benzene as a \"human carcinogen and hazardous air pollutant,\" he said.\n\nWhen we reached Hardcastle, he agreed that benzene is \"a proven carcinogen\" but said that\u2019s only so when a person is \"overly-exposed to it\" for a long period of time. Otherwise, he said, it hasn\u2019t been proven harmful.\n\n\"It\u2019s a carcinogen, but everything\u2019s a carcinogen,\" he said. \"You eat too much white bread and it\u2019s a carcinogen.\"\n\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality spokesman Terry Clawson told us that benzene is harmful depending on its concentration in air and how long someone is exposed to it. \"Typical outdoor concentrations\" of benzene, less than one part per billion, are \"much lower than concentrations that have been shown to cause harmful effects in people,\" he said. But exposure to higher concentrations, tens of thousands of parts per billion, over a period of many months to years \"has been shown to cause harmful effects on blood,\" he said. Longer exposures, over many years, have \"been shown to cause leukemia in workers,\" he said.\n\nA fact sheet issued by the agency in October 2007 says as much: \"Permitted levels of benzene should not cause adverse health and welfare effects,\" but breathing high levels of the chemical compound can damage blood cells, human studies indicate. \"Some occupational workers, who have been exposed to some of the highest air concentrations of benzene for years, experienced a decrease in the number of white blood cells circulating in their blood.\"\n\nAccording to the EPA\u2019s web page on hazards associated with benzene, chronic exposure for a year or more has caused blood disorders, including reduced numbers of red blood cells and aplastic anemia \u2014 a risk factor for developing acute non-lymphocytic leukemia. The EPA site says short-term exposure to benzene may cause drowsiness, dizziness, headaches, eye, skin and respiratory tract irritation, and, at high levels, unconsciousness.\n\nAnd a February 2009 study funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences found that leukemia risks could be greater at ambient levels of benzene exposure \u2014 that is, benzene in the air where people live, rather than where they work \u2014 \u00a0than previously thought.\n\nA 2009 EPA summary says that some studies, such as those gauging links between childhood exposure to benzene and childhood cancer, are equivocal. A 2001 study found a connection between Hodgkins lymphoma and young children who lived in high-traffic ares with higher concentrations of benzene during pregnancy or early childhood, while a 2002 study found no connection between childhood cancer rates and benzene concentrations in high-traffic neighborhoods.\n\nCloser to home, a 2010 study by researchers at the University of Texas and the Texas Department of State Health Services found that women living in Texas neighborhoods with high levels of benzene (more than 3 micrograms per cubic meter of air) were more likely to bear children with spinal bifida \u2014 a serious birth defect that can cause paralysis and neurological disorders.\n\nAccording to an August 2007 benzene fact sheet published by the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, \"some women who breathed high levels of benzene for many months had irregular menstrual periods and a decrease in the size of their ovaries.\" But, according to the fact sheet, \"we do not know for certain that benzene caused these effects.\"\n\nRecent studies have found that environmental exposure to benzene increases the risk of childhood cancer, birth defects and lowers birth weight, he said. \"Cancer is not the only concern. \"While it\u2019s true that the only \u2018proven\u2019 effects are in occupationally exposed workers, studies strongly suggest that adverse effects on children and pregnant women are probably at lower environmental levels.\n\nFinally, Martyn Smith, a toxicology professor at the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley, who has studied the health effects of benzene, told us that Hardcastle is \"wrong.\"\n\nThere is no known threshold for when benzene becomes carcinogenic, Smith said. According to a study Smith authored that was published in the Annual Review of Public Health in April 2010, \"there is probably no safe level of exposure of benzene, and all exposures constitute some risk.\"\n\nWhere does that leave us?\n\nIt\u2019s true that benzene is a common air pollutant and is found in everyday products such as detergents. But to claim that airborne benzene has not been proven harmful flies in the face of scientific evidence that long-term exposure in the workplace can cause cancer and other negative health effects \u2014 not to mention studies suggesting lower levels of environmental exposure may also be unsafe"}

It was a figure that drew attention and criticism.\nWe found that it depends on how you calculate it.\nBush\u2019s tax rate\nBush arrived at that 36 percent average by weighting his income -- so higher income and tax rate years counted more than the years when he earned far less -- including four years when he paid nothing in taxes and therefore had a zero tax rate. In fact, Bush didn\u2019t start paying a rate of 36 percent or higher until he left office in 2007.\nBush showed his annual tax rate for every year from 1981 through 2013. (He filed for an extension for 2014.) His footnotes explained that Bush was citing an effective federal tax rate calculated by dividing cumulative total tax paid by cumulative total taxable income. Abraham N.M. Shashy, Jr., former chief counsel for the Internal Revenue Service, calculated the rate for Bush.\nBush\u2019s income went up and down while he was in the private sector before he ran for governor for the first time in 1994. Later, it would drop while he was in the governor\u2019s mansion from January 1999 through January 2007 and then rise again when he left office. As his income fluctuated, so did his tax rate.\nDuring the 1980s, Bush\u2019s tax rate was usually less than 24 percent. For four years, his taxable income was either zero or negative as a result of losses taken on real estate and business investments while he worked with Miami real estate developer Armando Codina.\nHis income surpassed $1 million for the first time in 1990. During the 1990s his tax rate ranged from 27 to 33 percent.\nBush\u2019s income dropped while in office from 1999 through January 2007 and then soared from $260,000 in 2006 to $7.4 million in 2013. Since 2007, his rate has ranged from 36 to 40 percent.\nSo that means that Bush\u2019s rate only exceeded that 35 percent for seven of his 33 years of tax returns.\nWhether 36 percent was his average rate depends on a few factors, including what we should count as income to determine the rate.\nSome of the tax experts we interviewed came up with different calculations or disagreed with how Bush calculated his rate. Here are the issues they raised:\nWeighted average: On this point, we found some disagreement about whether Bush used the best method or not.\nBush used a weighted average, which counts the higher-earning years more than others. When we did a straight up average by adding up all the rates that Bush reported, we got an average of about 24.5 percent.\n\n"}

So the most obvious comparison is the dollar value of the world market for each.\nThe United Nations trade statistics branch estimated the oil export market at $788 billion in 2015. The estimate for aluminum was $106 billion, for copper $104 billion, and iron ore and concentrates $67 billion.\nCalculating the world market for coffee is a little trickier because the United Nations trade data lumps coffee in with other products that contain even just a trace of coffee, such as powdered mixes.\nWith help from John Baffes, senior economist at the World Bank\u2019s Development Prospects Group, we estimated the size of the coffee export market at about $19 billion. (We got the amount of coffee sold from the International Coffee Organization and the average price per kilogram from the World Bank. Baffes confirmed our math.)\nThe Starbucks press office pointed to a report by the International Institute for Sustainable Development that estimated the total market at $23 billion.\nThe keen observer will note that the coffee market is about one-fourth as large as the markets for aluminum and copper, and also less than the market in iron ore.\nBut what about other agricultural products?

When we reached out to his campaign, a spokesman provided us with a list of tree trimmers employed by the city\u2019s Department of Streets and Sanitation making at least $100,000 in total compensation. The spokesman said the names came from a database maintained by OpenTheBooks.com, which is run by Adam Andrzejewski, a self-styled conservative transparency advocate who unsuccessfully sought the 2010 Republican nomination for governor.\nWe found 13 trimmers with total pay listed at $100,000 or more in 2016 on OpenTheBooks.com, the latest year that database covers for the department. The figure includes overtime as well as base pay.\nGreen\u2019s spokesman said his candidate had stressed tree trimmers\u2019 pay in part to draw attention to large sums some city employees are making in overtime. So we turned to 2016 city data to determine how much overtime dollars factored in to those paychecks.\nCity payroll data show that every tree trimmer in the department made between roughly $74,000 and $76,000 in base salary that year, including the top-earning tree trimmers listed on OpenTheBooks.com.\nA separate city-maintained database measuring overtime catalogued the difference in pay that allowed some to reach six figures.\n\n"}

Before delivering her prepared statement, the committee\u2019s ranking Republican, Peter King, R-N.Y., noted correctly that the word \u201cterrorism\u201d did not appear in the text of her remarks.\nKing said that he was \u201cnot trying to get into semantics on this\u201d but that \u201cit\u2019s important for us in positions of leadership to constantly remind people how real that (terrorism) threat is \u2026 and if we don\u2019t do it, it\u2019s going to be hard for us to get legislative support for the measures that we think have to be taken.\u201d\nIn an aside to King as she addressed the committee, Napolitano then invoked the \u201cT\u201d word to describe the agency\u2019s mission: \u201cto confront and prepare for threats that face this nation, be they man-caused -- and terrorism, Rep.

{"label": "false", "claim": "Better Austin Today Says that under City Council Member Randi Shade, Austin had the \"highest city debt per person in Texas.\"", "evidence": "In a mailer backing Kathie Tovo over incumbent Austin City Council Member Randi Shade, the Better Austin Today political action committee recently said: \"Under Randi Shade we have had ... the highest city debt per person in Texas.\"\n\nNumero uno?\n\nJeff Jack, the group\u2019s chairman, told us the debt ranking traces to survey results posted online by the Texas Municipal League from asking cities to share their debt levels. Jack said that he added up each city\u2019s debt, listed on the survey, and divided that by each city\u2019s population to come up with per-person totals; Austin, he said, finished first, at $6,291 per person.\n\n\"There is quite a range when you start thinking about differences,\" Jack said.\n\nWe turned next to the league, whose executive director, Bennett Sandlin, initially cautioned the survey results \"are solely the result of city self-reporting\" and have not been verified.\n\nAt our request, the league took its survey results from 2008 through 2010 and calculated each responding city\u2019s per-capita debt. Counting three types of debt -- general obligation, certificates of obligation and revenue-backed -- Austin ranked 10th among Texas cities in 2008 and 2009, at $5,643 per resident and $5,787, respectively, and ninth in 2010, at $6,291, Jack\u2019s cited figure. Notably, much smaller cities showed greater per-person debt each of the years. In 2010, for instance, Johnson City and Galveston had more debt per person; the No. 1 per-person debt in the state appears to have been in Deport, which is 18 miles southeast of the East Texas city of Paris.\n\nSo, Austin finished in the top 10 among cities that answered the survey, and it was by far the highest-ranking big city. In 2008 and 2009, cities with greater overall debt per capita topped out in population with Granbury, home to about 8,000 residents. Galveston, higher ranked in 2010, had 57,500 residents to Austin\u2019s more than 750,000.\n\nHowever, Sandlin cautioned against making city-to-city debt comparisons that fold in outstanding revenue bonds. \"The reason is that, unlike general-obligation and certificates-of-obligation debt, revenue bonds are typically not payable by the citizens through property taxes, but rather by the users of city utilities, such as water or electric (services),\" he wrote. \"Many city utilities serve areas far larger than city limits, so those debts are being serviced by non-citizens and thus might not be a fair measure of how much debt the citizens bear.\"\n\nIn Austin\u2019s case, Austin Energy, the city-owned electric utility serving residents of Austin plus the rest of Travis County and a portion of Williamson County, has more than $1 billion in outstanding revenue-backed debt and the city\u2019s water utility, airport and convention center together account for more than $2 billion in revenue-supported debt, according to Art Alfaro, the city treasurer. Those debts, to rehash, are to be paid from revenue by the entities that issued them--and not from property tax dollars.\n\nAlfaro said in an interview that any fair city-to-city debt comparisons should be limited to general-obligation debt, the only kind backed by property taxes. Austin\u2019s more than $800 million in this type of debt reflects bonds issued to build streets, libraries, parks and anything needed to run the city, he said, the vast majority approved by voters.\n\nRemoving Austin\u2019s revenue-backed debt changes its ranking considerably, the league\u2019s survey results show. By this gauge, Austin was 208th among responding cities, at $871 per resident, in 2008 and 120th in 2009 and 2010, at $1,213 and $1,258, respectively. Not counting revenue-backed debt, among larger cities, Lubbock and Richardson had greater per-capita debt in 2010 and Houston\u2019s per-capita debt was more than the debt for Austin in 2008 and 2009.\n\nBy email, Jack said not counting revenue-backed debt doesn\u2019t make sense: \"If a business entity has a cost increase it passes that cost along to the consumer. In the same way revenue bonds, though not going through the (city\u2019s) general fund, increase the cost indirectly through higher utility rates, user fees and the like,\" Jack said. It \"all adds up \u2026 it is the total cost that must be considered.\"\n\nSeparately, we asked Standard & Poor\u2019s, which bestows credit ratings to cities, how it would analyze the per-capita debts of Texas cities. Dallas-based analyst Horatio Aldrete said the firm puts Austin\u2019s \"net debt\"--less revenue-related debt but taking into account the general-obligation debts of overlapping jurisdictions such as Travis County and the Austin school district--at $3,664 per person. That\u2019s compared to $3,600 in Dallas, $3,611 in Fort Worth, $4,700 in San Antonio and $4,000 in Houston. Austin, Aldrete said, is \"kind of middle of the pack.\"\n\nAldrete said it doesn\u2019t fold in revenue-related debts because those are absorbed by rate payers, not the city.\n\nThe firm\u2019s Austin report says it raised its rating of Austin\u2019s debt to \"AAA\" in 2008 \"based on the likelihood that the city's employment base and fiscal policies should allow it to maintain its strong financial condition even during economic fluctuations such as the current recession.\"\n\nOur take? Taking into account all debts linked to the city, including revenue-backed debt, Austin didn\u2019t rank first among Texas cities. And by a fairer comparison--focused on debts funded from property taxes--Austin landed way short of tops in Texas. Also, the statement\u2019s laying of responsibility for the debt ranking on a single council member is unsupported"}

We could not find any either in our search.\u00a0\nThat said, experts agree that mask wearing is a primary way to do so, albeit in conjunction with other steps, such as hand-washing, social-distancing and -- now that vaccines are available -- getting a shot.\nAjay Sethi, an epidemiologist and professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told us wearing a properly fitted mask is \"imperative.\"\u00a0\n\"Both masks and physical distancing are needed to interrupt transmission of the coronavirus in indoor environments,\" Sethi said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. \"When food or drink is being served for consumption, then maintaining proper physical distance is imperative.

In addition, the agreement says, \"Iran will permit the IAEA regular access, including daily access as requested by the IAEA, to relevant buildings at (the Iranian nuclear facility at) Natanz ... for 15 years.\"\nHowever, this sort of 24/7 surveillance will not be the rule everywhere in the Iranian nuclear archipelago.\n\"At most locations, inspections will be every once in a while, on a schedule the inspectors judge to be sufficient based on the sensitivity of the activities at that location, how long it would take for Iran to do something there that would make a difference, and so on,\" Bunn said. \u00a0\u00a0\nIn fact, even if Iran ultimately agrees to a contentious inspection, the wait could be as long as 24 days.\nThe agreement spells out that if the IAEA and Iran can\u2019t work out their differences over suspicions about undeclared nuclear materials or activities within 14 days, a joint commission empowered by the agreement would try to resolve the situation for another seven days. Once the commission decides what to do, Iran would have three more days to follow through.\nIn other words, when looking at Iran\u2019s nuclear complex as a whole, \"the IAEA can\u2019t just drive up with no warning \u2014 it\u2019s not \u2018anytime, anywhere,\u2019 \" Bunn said\nSo on this point, Rubio is justified in suggesting that the deal doesn\u2019t include \"anytime, anywhere\" inspections.\nDid Obama promise that the agreement with Iran would include an \u2018anytime, anywhere\u2019 inspection regime?\nThis question is a bit more complicated.\nWe located at least one, and possibly two, instances in which Ben Rhodes -- an assistant to the president and deputy national security advisor for strategic communications and speechwriting -- said the deal would include \"anytime, anywhere\" inspections.\nOne of Rhodes\u2019\u00a0comments came in an interview with Tapper on April 6, 2015. Tapper asked Rhodes, \"So the Israelis have put out this list of things that they think should be in the final deal with Iran, including allowing inspectors to go anywhere, anytime. That seems perfectly reasonable, no?\"\nRhodes responded, \"Well, Jake, first of all, under this deal, you will have anywhere, anytime 24/7 access as it relates to the nuclear facilities that Iran has.\"\n\n"}

Later in his appearance, Obama called it important to study ways of redesigning \"our systems\" to step up voter turnout and then he said \"the folks who are currently governing the good state of Texas aren\u2019t interested in having more people participate.\"\nHe was almost certainly referring to the Texas mandate carried into law by ruling Republicans that requires voters to present one of several types of government-issued photo identification before voting at the polls.\nIn 2014, U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos of Corpus Christi held the 2011 law unconstitutional, in part citing expert testimony that 608,470 registered voters didn\u2019t already have any of the IDs the state was newly requiring at the polls. Ramos\u2019 ruling, appealed by the state, lately awaits review by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\nUnder the Texas law, a voter must present one of these kinds of identification at the polls: a Texas driver\u2019s license; a personal ID issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety; an election certificate, which is a form of state photo identification created by the law; a U.S. military ID card; a U.S. passport; or a Texas license to carry a handgun.\nReaders asked us to check Obama\u2019s claim that the U.S.--alone among \"advanced democracies\"--makes it harder for people to vote.\nThe term \"advanced democracies\" refers to countries with institutionalized democracies and a high degree of economic development.

I mean, I don't even think Barack Obama would be for binational health insurance.\"\n\nWe wondered whether Santorum, a former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, was right in insinuating that Perry spoke in favor of binational health insurance in 2001.\n\nFirst, some background: Binational, or \"cross-border,\" health insurance refers to coverage that provides benefits in two countries or in a country other than the one in which an enrollee lives or works.\n\nCalifornia has been a leader in binational plans, according to a 2010 report by David Warner, a professor at the University of Texas LBJ School of Public Affairs. He told us in an interview that although plan specifics differ, the general idea is for U.S. employers to offer their workers a choice between receiving their health care services exclusively in Mexico or getting standard U.S.-based coverage. Workers may live and work in the United States or may live in Mexico and commute across the border to legally work on the U.S. side.\n\nWarner's report says that at least four U.S. insurers offer binational plans that allow enrollees to access networks of providers in Mexico. For example, Blue Shield of California's \"Access Baja\" option generally restricts enrollees, who must live within 50 miles of the California-Mexico border, to seeking care through providers in the Mexican border cities of Tijuana and Mexicali.\n\nProponents say that because binational plans are cheaper than standard U.S. plans (primarily because health care is cheaper in Mexico), they make it easier for low-income workers to afford coverage.\n\nIn Texas, the state Department of Insurance told us that it doesn't know of insurers offering cross-border plans. However, it's possible that some employers in the border area do \u2014 if they are \"self-funded,\" meaning they bear the financial responsibility and risks of coverage themselves. Such plans are not regulated by the agency.\n\nTexas proponents of binational plans have said they could help reduce the uninsured population in the state's border region. In 2010, 43 percent of border residents were uninsured, compared to 23 percent statewide, according to data from the Texas Department of State Health Services.\n\nOpponents have expressed concerns about the quality of care provided by Mexican health care providers and the inability of the state to monitor it.\n\nBack to Perry and his speech.\n\nAccording to an Aug. 31, 2011, Dallas Morning News blog post, Perry mentioned binational health insurance at an August 2001 summit on border issues. It was hosted by the University of Texas-Pan American in Edinburg, which is in the Rio Grande Valley about 10 miles from the Texas-Mexico border.\n\nAccording to news articles, the meeting brought together high-level government officials and business leaders from Mexico and the United States, including Norman Mineta, then the U.S. secretary of transportation. An Aug. 23, 2001, Morning News news article said panels at the summit weighed topics such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, water issues and border health concerns.\n\nPerry spoke to the gathering on Aug. 22, 2001. According to the text of his remarks, posted on his state website, he was upbeat about increased cooperation and trade between the United States and Mexico. And he called for the two nations to work together to solve shared problems.\n\n"}

The Israel flight ban became a cause celebre earlier for conservatives such as Ted Cruz, and the comparison of the Israel ban and a possible Ebola flight ban has been the subject of comment on some conservative blogs.\nThat ban was in effect for parts of July 22 and July 23, in the middle of a weeks-long battle between Israel and Hamas. The Federal Aviation Administration ban was enacted after a Hamas rocket landed within a mile of the airport, prompting safety concerns for airliners flying into and out of the airport, according to news reports. (This was less than a week after a Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 was shot down while flying over a war zone in eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014.)\nAs the official FAA notification about the ban put it, \"At 12:15 EDT on July 22, 2014, the FAA issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) informing U.S. airlines that they are prohibited from flying to or from Israel's Ben Gurion International Airport for a period of up to 24 hours.\"\nThe notification went on to clarify that the move \"applies only to U.S. operators, and has no authority over foreign airlines operating to or from the airport.\"\nThis is an important distinction. The FAA\u2019s decision prevented U.S. carriers from flying into or out of Ben Gurion Airport -- but it did not prevent foreign-owned carriers from flying into or out of Ben Gurion, including those headed to the United States, carrying Americans or people of any other nationality.\n\n"}

Ninety seven percent of SNAP benefits are paid in the proper amounts to people who are really eligible.\"\n\nFood stamps, which help beneficiaries buy groceries, often stir strong claims. In March 2013, PolitiFact in Washington rated Pants on Fire the declaration that 70 percent of the program\u2019s funding went to its employees. The broadest calculation of SNAP administrative costs topped out at 5 percent of its costs.\n\nIn December 2012, PolitiFact Ohio rated as True a claim that growth in food stamp participation had trailed increases in unemployment, while in August 2012, we rated as True a claim that one in seven American families is on food stamps. According to the Agriculture Department, a record 46.6 million residents participated in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2012, up from 44.7 million the year before and 40.3 million in fiscal 2010.\n\nAs of March 2013, more than 1.6 million Texas households were enrolled.\n\nFraud concerns\n\nFood stamp fraud occasionally draws attention, too. A Feb. 6, 2012, Reuters news story quoted Kevin Concannon, U.S. Department of Agriculture undersecretary for food, nutrition and consumer services, as saying that fraud at that time accounted for 1 percent of food stamp benefits, while costing the government $750 million a year. \"This is $750 million that isn't being used to provide food to individuals and families, and that issue isn't lost on us,\" Concannon said.\n\nThe story said the program's \"biggest step forward in fraud prevention came in 2004, when the government replaced paper coupons with plastic cards that are loaded electronically like debit cards.\" Concannon also said the program was adding high-tech strategies to its enforcement quiver, the story said, among them plans to work with social media firms and a data mining company to root out abuse. The agency has a website to solicit food-stamp fraud tips.\n\n\"While administrators work to reduce payment errors,\" the story said, \"the USDA is collaborating with state agencies to investigate recipients suspected of committing fraud or misusing benefits. It also will seek tougher penalties for stores engaged in trafficking. Trafficking generally takes the form of users \u2018selling\u2019 their benefits for roughly 50 cents on the dollar to brick-and-mortar retailers or to individuals found via websites like eBay or Facebook.\"\n\nBasis of claim\n\nGallego\u2019s claim did not speak directly to trafficking scams. But are 97 percent of food stamp benefits paid in proper amounts to eligible residents, as he said?\n\nBy email, Gallego spokeswoman Rebecca Acu\u00f1a attributed the percentage to research by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal, Washington, D.C.-based think tank. In a blog post revised May 16, 2013, the center said the House committee-approved version of the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013, which Gallego and committee members were discussing when he spoke, would cut SNAP by almost $21 billion over the next decade, eliminating food assistance to nearly 2 million low-income people, mostly working families with children and senior citizens.\n\nThe center said in a May 10, 2013, blog post: \"Only 3 percent of SNAP benefits represent overpayments, meaning they either went to ineligible households or went to eligible households but in excessive amounts. SNAP achieved its lowest error rate on record in fiscal year 2011, with a national overpayment rate of just 2.99 percent (see graph). The underpayment rate that year was 0.81 percent. Thus, the net loss to the federal government \u2014 the amounts lost through over\u00adpayments minus those saved by underpayments \u2014 was only 2.2 percent.\" An accompanying graph, which we show below, was headlined: \"SNAP Error Rates Are at an All-Time Low.\"\n\nAlso, the center said, relatively \"few payment errors reflect dishonesty or fraud. The overwhelming majority result from honest mistakes by recipients, eligibility workers, data entry clerks, or computer programmers.

{"label": "true", "claim": "Pete Buttigieg Americans \"say that what they want is a choice\" to join a single-payer system like Medicare rather than ending private insurance.", "evidence": "A day after winning the Republican primary for U.S. Senate, former Wisconsin governor Tommy Thompson used health care to contrast himself with his opponent in the general election, U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-Madison.\n\nIn the Aug. 15, 2012 interview with Vicki McKenna, a conservative radio talk show host based at WIBA-AM (1310) in Madison, Thompson declared: \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\"Tammy Baldwin, who is a nice lady, but believes philosophically that she wants a health care system that is completely government controlled. She did not think 'Obamacare' went far enough. She was far beyond 'Obamacare.' She wants a Medicare system for all, in which the government makes all the decisions for your health care system.\"\n\nWe rated Mostly True a Thompson claim that Baldwin is the most liberal member of the House. But with polls indicating most Americans want to repeal Obama\u2019s federal health reform law, does Baldwin really want to go further? To a \"completely government-controlled\" health care system that provides Medicare not only for people over 65 but for everyone?\n\nHealth reform terms\n\nAs we begin, it\u2019s important to look at key terms connected to health care reform and Obama\u2019s reform law.\n\nThese definitions are from the Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent organization that analyzes the health care system.\n\nUniversal care: A system that provides health coverage to all people through measures such as an individual mandate or a single-payer system.\n\nIndividual mandate: A requirement that all individuals obtain health insurance.\n\nSingle-payer: A health care system in which the government pays for health care services, but is not involved in the delivery of health care.\n\nPublic option: An insurance plan administered and funded by the government that would be offered along with private insurance plans.\n\nObama\u2019s health reform law\n\nThe health reform that Obama signed into law in 2010 law significantly increases government regulation of health insurers and includes an individual mandate for nearly all Americans.\n\n(During the primary campaign we rated False a claim by Thompson, who supports repealing Obama\u2019s reform law, that he never supported a mandate.)\n\nUnder the reform law, as PolitiFact National has reported, employers will continue providing health insurance to most Americans and, overall, more people will get private health coverage. And it goes without saying that the reform law doesn\u2019t take the European approach, where the government owns the hospitals and the doctors are public employees; nor the Canadian universal-single payer approach, in which no private insurance is allowed.\n\nBaldwin\u2019s position\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at Baldwin, who was elected to the House in 1998, and see how she stands on these key points:\n\nUniversal care: Baldwin has long advocated providing health insurance for everyone.\n\nIn 1999, Baldwin spoke at a Washington, D.C. rally for the \"Universal Health Care 2000 (U2K)\" movement. In a news release about the event, she said she was one of the few politicians who ran for office in 1998 \"who dared to make \u2018health care for all\u2019 the focus of her campaign for Congress.\"\n\nBaldwin also announced that Wisconsin could be one of 10 states to receive grants to develop suggestions for a \"federal-state partnership to provide health coverage for all of their citizens.\"\n\n(Interestingly, the announcement was made with Thompson at the governor\u2019s office in Madison, the release said.)\n\nIn 2000, Baldwin introduced the Health Security for All Americans Act, which would have required states to provide universal coverage. The bill died without a House vote, as it did Baldwin after reintroduced it in 2002, 2004 and 2005.\n\nSingle-payer: Baldwin tried to get the government more involved in health care by making it the sole payer of health care services.\n\nIn 2009, on the day the House Energy and Commerce Committee voted for Obama\u2019s reform law, Baldwin said: \"I am one of the members of this committee who believes strongly that a single-payer health system is the best way to comprehensively and fairly reform our health care system.\"\n\nThat version of Obama\u2019s measure didn\u2019t include the single-payer element, but Baldwin said she had \"played a role in securing a commitment that a single-payer health care alternative will receive consideration by the full House of Representatives.\"\n\nSo, in pushing single-payer, Baldwin would go beyond Obama\u2019s law.\n\nPublic option: Baldwin advocates for the federal government offering health insurance along with private insurers.\n\nBaldwin said she hoped a public option in Obama\u2019s law would lead to single-payer. The version of Obama\u2019s measure that Baldwin voted for in 2009 included the public option, but the final version did not.\n\nBaldwin continues to advocate for going further than the Obama reform law does. On her official House website, Baldwin says her \"driving motivation in politics is to pass legislation that will guarantee health care for all in America.\" She also says that the reform law \"is not perfect, and I will continue to work to improve it as it is phased in over the next four years. In particular, I strongly believe that allowing Americans the choice of a public option is essential.\"\n\nNow, to the third part of Thompson\u2019s claim, that Baldwin supports \"Medicare for all.\"\n\nThompson campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir pointed out that Baldwin was one of several dozen co-sponsors of the Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act, which has been introduced several times during her tenure. It would have provided universal care by creating a national health insurance program and prohibiting private insurers from selling coverage that duplicates benefits in the program.\n\nSusan Giaimo, a visiting political science professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee, whose specialties include health care politics and policy, told us the government would have had a lot of clout in negotiating prices with health care providers under the bill. It\u2019s not clear whether \"Medicare for all\" would get rid of private health insurance, but private health care providers would remain, she said. And it doesn\u2019t go as far as the British model of \"socialized medicine,\" with the government owning hospitals and employing the health care workers, she said. \u00a0\n\nA final note:\n\nThompson and other Republicans like to cite a clip from a speech Baldwin made at a September 2010 political rally in which she said, chuckling: \"I actually was for a government takeover of medicine. I was for a single-payer plan.\"\n\nBaldwin actually was criticizing those who called Obama\u2019s reform law a \"government takeover\" (which PolitiFact chose as its lie of the year for 2010). But she did go on to say she wanted to go further than the reform law does: \"I was for a single-payer plan and that isn\u2019t, as we know, what we ended up with, but I also think what we ended up with was incredible progress for the American people.\"\n\nOur rating\n\nThompson said Baldwin wants a \"completely government-controlled\" health care system that goes \"far beyond 'Obamacare'\" and is \"a Medicare system for all.\"\n\nBaldwin hasn\u2019t hasn\u2019t advocated for socialized medicine. But she has pushed \"Medicare for all\" legislation and she supports single payer and the public option, government elements that go beyond Obama\u2019s reform law"}

Bush was president, and from June 2009 until June 2013, during Obama\u2019s tenure.\nUnder Obama\u2019s recovery, private-sector employment increased by a little under 6.05 million, compared to 3.17 million during the equivalent period during the Bush recovery.\nThat\u2019s \"nearly twice as many jobs,\" as Obama said. And experts say this is a credible way of measuring the numbers.\nBut it isn\u2019t the only way.\nInstead of starting the clock at the official end of the recovery, one could start it from the low point in private-sector employment. These aren\u2019t the same dates, because a low point private-sector employment isn\u2019t the determining factor for pinpointing the end of a recession.\nUsing this method makes Obama\u2019s recovery less impressive. During the Bush recovery, private-sector employment continued to tumble all the way to July 2003 -- a year and a half after the recession\u2019s official end. By comparison, during the Obama recovery, private-sector employment began to rise in February 2010, just eight months after the official end of the recession. So the extended slide in private-sector jobs under Bush artificially reduced the number of jobs created during the first part of his recovery.\n\n"}

Rick \"Let\u2019s get to work!\" Scott may be trying out a new slogan for his re-election campaign. More and more, his priorities are screaming \"Let\u2019s get to class!\"\n\nScott devoted much of his third State of the State address on Tuesday to education, singling out educators as special guests and asking lawmakers to stand in honor of their favorite teacher. Then he turned to another telltale sign of showing love: showing them money!\n\nTo polite applause, Scott reiterated his desire for the Legislature to give teachers a $2,500 across-the-board raise. He asked lawmakers to use his proposed education spending, which calls for an increase of $1.2 billion from last year, as their guide as they craft the state\u2019s 2013-14 budget.\n\n\"Our total education investment of $10.7 billion in state funding for K-12 schools this year is the highest state funding level in Florida history,\" he said. \"This represents an increase of more than $400 in per student funding over the current fiscal year.\"\n\nIs he right? We\u2019ll explain.\n\nScott\u2019s statement is carefully crafted to specify that his budget proposal would provide the highest state funding level ever. Scott\u2019s proposal would be the highest ever in terms of the state government\u2019s actual dollar investment. In second place would be the 2007-08 budget signed by Gov. Charlie Crist, when the state allocated $9.71 billion.\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t tell the entire story. Schools have a complex funding formula that involves a mix of local taxes, state dollars and, in recent years, federal stimulus money.\n\nIf Scott had his way, Florida\u2019s total K-12 education budget would be $18.47 billion (the Legislature decides how to spend the state\u2019s dough). If Scott gets the budget he wants, it would not be the highest spending on education ever. It would trail the 2007-08 budget signed by Gov. Charlie Crist by $280 million.\n\nEducation spending per student tells the same story. Yes, at $3,941, the state\u2019s share of per-pupil spending in Scott\u2019s budget would be the highest dollar investment.\n\nBut this view again neglects the complete picture of education spending. Total per-pupil funding proposed in Scott\u2019s budget would be $6,700. This would be a $412 increase from the current year, but it lags behind per-pupil spending of $7,126 in the 2007-08 budget signed by Crist.\n\nThis is an important point: Six years ago, the state had fewer students but spent more money on each. Now we have 85,000 more students but spend less money on each one, according to Department of Education data.\n\nWe wondered if Scott\u2019s proposal would hold up as the state\u2019s biggest education investment when adjusted for inflation. Using a Consumer Price Index calculator from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we compared Scott\u2019s proposal with state spending on education for the past 10 years.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWe found state spending on education, when adjusted for inflation, would not be significantly different than it was from 2004 to 2007.\n\nOur ruling\n\n"}

The immediate risk to the general American public remained low, she said.\nThe following day, a health official from Washington state, where there were four presumptive cases of COVID-19, joined a CDC press briefing and said the state was \"starting to see some spread in the community\" and the public risk was increasing. \"Should we start to see more spread in Washington, we might consider recommending measures like cancelling large public events,\" said Kathy Lofy, a Washington state health official.\n\nFauci is interviewed on NBC's \"Today Show\" on Feb. 29\nWhat did Fauci say on Feb. 29?\nWe found two televised appearances by Fauci on Feb. 29.

Analysts have said her proposed tax plan would have minimal impact on middle-income Americans.\nHowever, Clinton is not the only candidate to make such a promise. In fact, we rated a similar claim by Clinton Pants on Fire in July. Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker gave the claim Four Pinocchios, its lowest rating.\nWe found that 13 of the 17 GOP candidates made promises last year that were far more encompassing than Clinton\u2019s. They vowed not to raise taxes on anyone \u2014 including the middle class. Donald Trump was not one of these; more on this in a bit.\nTwelve of the GOP candidates signed no-tax pledges with Americans for Tax Reform, a fiscally conservative group founded by Grover Norquist. They promised to \"oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses\" and \"any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.\"\nThe 12 signers were Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Rick Santorum, John Kasich, Chris Christie, Bobby Jindal, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, Jim Gilmore,George Pataki and Rick Perry.\nA 13th GOP candidate, Mike Huckabee, signed a personal oath to oppose all tax increases.\nTwo other Republican candidates had signed an Americans for Tax Reform\u2019s no-tax pledge before last year: Lindsey Graham and Scott Walker.\nSo contrary to Clinton\u2019s claim, 15 of the 17 GOP candidates had signed no-tax-hike pledges \u2014 not just on the middle class but everyone.\n\n"}

{"label": "pants-fire", "claim": "Barack Obama Says Mitt Romney plans to \"fire\" Big Bird.", "evidence": "Scare tactics have a long history in American politics. Now, the Obama campaign is trying to scare preschoolers -- and their parents -- with a claim that Mitt Romney wants to fire Big Bird.\n\nIt all started with Romney's remark in the last debate that he opposes federal subsidies for PBS.\n\n\"I\u2019m sorry, Jim,\" Romney told debate moderator Jim Lehrer during the debate\u00a0at University of Denver on Oct. 3. \"I\u2019m going to stop the subsidy to PBS. \u2026 \u00a0I like PBS, I love Big Bird. I actually like you, too. But I\u2019m not going to \u2014 I\u2019m not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for.\"\n\nThe towering yellow fellow stole the show again\u00a0on Monday in Derry, N.H., when a plucky Big Bird impersonator from President Barack Obama\u2019s reelection team hoisted a sign stating, \"Romney-Boehner. Tough on Sesame Street; Soft on Wall Street,\" outside U.S. House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s speaking event stumping for the former Massachusetts governor.\n\nBig Bird didn\u2019t have much to say, but his handler, Holly Shulman, communications director for Obama for America-New Hampshire, did.\n\n\"Mitt Romney\u2019s plan is to give $5 trillion in tax breaks skewed toward the wealthiest Americans,\" Shulman said, \"while getting rid of the things that people care about, getting rid of Planned Parenthood, firing Big Bird and voucherizing Medicare.\"\n\nNationwide, surrogates for Obama are harping on the future of the Sesame Street hero to highlight another way they say Romney is out of touch.\n\nOn Tuesday, Obama released a sarcastic campaign commercial, mocking Romney for taking on \"menaces to our economy\" like Big Bird, \"no matter where they nest.\"\n\nSesame Workshop, the nonprofit behind Sesame Street, has since cried fowl\u00a0over the ad and asked the campaign to take it down.\n\nBut we wondered whether the campaign was going too far with its claim that Romney would \"fire\" the Sesame Street icon. And as Big Bird often says, \"Asking questions is a good way of finding things out!\"\n\nFirst we contacted Obama\u2019s campaign for sources. They chirped about the small impact reducing public broadcasting appropriations would have on the federal budget, and cited articles where Romney talks about the cuts and PBS news releases about their station\u2019s reach.\n\nWe asked Romney\u2019s campaign for some background.\n\nIn an interview with Fortune magazine\u00a0earlier this year, Romney ticked off a number of so-called subsidy programs he would eliminate if elected, including the one behind PBS.\n\nFor fiscal 2013, the federal government appropriated $445 million for public broadcasting\u00a0according to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The Washington Post compared that with the $1.42 billion the government spent for Amtrak, and the $146 million for the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities\u00a0-- two other subsidies Romney said he would cut.\n\n\"Some of these things, like those endowment efforts and PBS I very much appreciate and like what they do in many cases, but I just think they have to stand on their own rather than receiving money borrowed from other countries, as our government does on their behalf,\" he told Fortune.\n\nThe current appropriation is just over one one-hundredth of one percent (.01 percent) of the federal budget -- approximately $1.35 per person per year, Jan McNamara, senior director of PBS\u2019 Corporate Communications told PolitiFact in an email.\n\nIt accounts for about 15 percent of the revenue for public television and public radio overall, she added.\n\nThe way the system works is the Corporation for Public Broadcasting administers the funds with a \"definitive, federally mandated\" formula. The federal appropriation doesn\u2019t go directly to PBS.\n\n\"By statute, the majority of funds are distributed directly to the approximately 1,300 locally owned public television and radio stations currently serving viewers and listeners,\" McNamara said. \"These locally governed, community-based stations depend on this critical seed money, which they leverage to raise the addition (sic) funds needed to provide content and services that are available to everyone, regardless of geography or ability to pay for a cable or satellite subscription.\"\n\nFor each dollar in federal funding invested in local stations, the stations raise an additional $6 on their own, including millions of contributions from volunteer supporters as part of a public-private partnership.\n\nPBS, a nonprofit public broadcasting television network, has nearly 360 member stations, according to its website. Sesame Street has been one of its staple programs for about 43 years.\n\nForbes also noted\u00a0almost 60 percent of funding for public television comes from private donors or grants, with additional funding coming from dues paid by member stations.\n\nBig Bird's nest egg\n\nAccording to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting\u2019s public affairs office, it provided $1.25 million to Sesame Street through a National Program Service grant to PBS in fiscal 2011, along with an $8 million grant to Sesame Workshop, for \"The Electric Company: Phase II.\"\n\nAnd in fiscal 2012, Sesame Street got $1.4 million in funding through the National Program Service grant, which supports children\u2019s and prime-time television programming that \"engages, inspires, and educates,\" including other PBS programs such as Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood, PBS NewsHour\u00a0and NOVA, officials said.\n\nAccording to Sesame Workshop\u2019s most recent 990 form, filed for its 2010 year ending June 30, 2011, government grants and contributions accounted for about 5 percent of the $133 million revenue they brought in. Because much of the government money goes to other programs, the subsidy for Sesame Street is even lower.\n\nAnd MSN Money\u00a0pointed out that Sesame brought in $46.9 million in licensing revenue for toys and other merchandise in 2011.\n\nSo how much would slashing the public broadcasting appropriation impact the feathery, eight-foot-two-inch friend everyone\u2019s so worried about?\n\nNot much, according to an interview\u00a0CNN did with Sherrie Westin, executive vice president and chief marketing officer for Sesame Workshop.\n\n\"Sesame Workshop receives very, very little funding from PBS. So, we are able to raise our funding through philanthropic, through our licensed product, which goes back into the educational programming, through corporate underwriting and sponsorship,\" Westin told CNN. \"So quite frankly, you can debate whether or not there should be funding of public broadcasting. But when they always try to tout out Big Bird, and say we\u2019re going to kill Big Bird \u2013 that is actually misleading, because Sesame Street will be here.\"\n\nOn Monday, Westin blogged about the issue again\u00a0on Sesame Workshop\u2019s website, explaining her conversation on CNN was only \"half the story.\"\n\n\"Sesame Workshop has created a financially sustainable model to fund production of our educational programming here and around the world,\" Westin wrote. \"But Sesame Street would not exist were it not for PBS and its local stations, which is the distribution system for Big Bird and friends to reach all children across the United States, particularly the low income children who need us most.\"\n\n\"A CNN poll said 7% of the American public think that PBS gets as much as half the US budget! 30% think it\u2019s 5%. \u00a0In reality it\u2019s 0.014%. \u00a0Let\u2019s keep that in perspective and also not forget the return on that investment: millions of children who have benefited from early childhood education brought to them by the letters, P. B. S.!\"\n\nOur Ruling\n\nIn its latest attempt to portray Romney as heartless, the Obama campaign is making a serious allegation that he wants to put one of America's most beloved children's characters in the unemployment line.\n\nRomney has been clear that his plan for PBS is not specific to Big Bird (nor to Jim Lehrer for that matter). He simply wants to end federal subsidies.\n\nIt's a ridiculous stretch to equate that with firing the 8-foot-2 yellow bird. Just as Democrats have scared senior citizens about losing Medicare, they are now scaring preschoolers about losing Big Bird. Pants on Fire!\n\n"}
{"label": "false", "claim": "Morgan Griffith \"On most things except witch trials, Virginia will always have been first.\"", "evidence": "U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-9th, was among a handful of Virginia congressmen who voted against a resolution earlier this month that proclaimed Salem, Mass., as the birthplace of the National Guard.\n\nGriffith insisted Virginia organized a militia in 1624 -- five years before Massachusetts. He noted Virginia was the first English settlement in North America and, in an interview with The Washington Times, good-naturedly accused Massachusetts of having \"first colony envy.\" Then, in a TV interview, he rekindled a deadly flame in the history of Salem, Mass.\n\n\"On most things except witch trials, Virginia will always have been first,\" Griffith, told WSLS-TV10 in Roanoke on April 3.\n\nWe\u2019re sorry to say that we can\u2019t resolve which state is the birthplace of the National Guard. Florida also lays claim to that title, saying an organized militia was created a few years after St. Augustine was settled in 1565.\n\nSome argue that settlers came as armed bands and could all be considered part of militias. Jamestown was established in 1607 and pilgrims landed in Plymouth, Mass. in 1620.\n\nBut we were able to get to the bottom of Griffith\u2019s other claim -- that Virginia was not the first colony to hold a witchcraft trial.\n\nGriffith\u2019s press secretary, Maggie Seidel, said the congressman\u2019s statement was \"tongue-in-cheek.\" When asked if there is proof of Griffith\u2019s witch trial claim, she sent us a news story containing some of her boss\u2019s comments.\n\nSo we turned to Marc Carlson, Librarian of Special Collections and University Archives at the University of Tulsa, who has extensively chronicled witchcraft trials in Europe and North America. His research shows the first person legally accused of witchery in the colonies was Joan Wright of Surry County, Va., in either 1622 or 1626. \u00a0\n\nWitnesses accused Wright, a left-handed midwife, of correctly predicting the death of four people, threatening to make a neighbor\u2019s maid \"dance naked and stand before the Tree,\" and possibly casting a spell that led to the death of a sickly child born to a mother who had declined Wright\u2019s nursing services.\n\nAlthough Wright was arraigned, Carlson said she did not stand trial.\n\nThe first known accusation of witching in Massachusetts targeted Grace Dutch in 1628 or 1629, but there\u2019s no evidence that she went to trial, either. Records show she died in 1694.\n\nThe first known witchcraft trial in the colonies occurred in Virginia in 1641, resulting in the acquittal of the wife of George Barker. The exact charges are not known. But her accuser -- Jane Rookens of Lower Norfolk -- was sorry for what she said, according to Minutes of the Council and General Court of Colonial Virginia. The accuser\u2019s husband, George Rookens, was ordered to pay the Barkers\u2019 expenses and court charges.\n\nThe next known trials occurred in Connecticut in 1647. Mary Johnson, a servant, confessed to \"uncleanness with men and Devils.\" There are varying tales, but no documents, on how she was punished. Also that year, Alse Young of Connecticut became the first American to be hanged for witchcraft.\n\nMassachusetts\u2019 first trial came the next year and resulted the hanging of Margaret Jones, a medical practitioner who the court said had \"such a malignant touch, as many persons, men, women, and children, whom she stroked or touched with any affection or displeasure, or etc. \u00a0were taken with deafness, or vomiting, or other violent pains or sickness.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\nAlthough Virginia held the first known witchcraft trial in colonies, it was not a hotbed of suspicion and water tests. Carlson lists 11 accusations of witchcraft and sorcery in the Old Dominion and the only execution appears to have been on a ship heading to Jamestown in 1654 when Kath Grady was hanged as a \"witch at sea.\"\n\nMassachusetts, on the other hand, embraced a puritanical understanding of evil and had 19 accusations excluding Salem\u2019s inquisition in 1692. The witch hunts in that village swept up about 200 people, 19 of whom were hanged and one of whom was crushed by rocks in torture.\n\nOur ruling\n\nMassachusetts is well known for its attempts to root out sorcery, but evidence shows Virginia held the first witchcraft trial in the colonies.\n\nGriffith deserves no toil or trouble for his jest"}

Matt Gaetz\u2019s vote against a human trafficking bill back in 2017 is popping up on social media following a New York Times report that federal authorities are investigating whether Gaetz violated human trafficking laws.\nThe New York Times reported based on unnamed sources that the Justice Department is investigating whether Gaetz, a Florida Republican, had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl and paid for her to travel with him. The newspaper reported that the investigation started during the final months of the Trump administration and is part of a broader investigation into a Gaetz ally, Joel Greenberg, a former tax collector in Seminole County who was indicted on charges including sex trafficking. Gaetz has not been charged.\nGaetz said on Twitter and told the New York Times, Axios and Fox News that the allegations are false and are part of an effort to extort $25 million from him and his family.\u00a0\nA Facebook post used the popular \"how it started, how it\u2019s going\" meme to juxtapose the Justice Department investigation with Gaetz\u2019s past vote on a bill in Congress.\nHow it started: \"Matt Gaetz defends lone no vote on anti-human trafficking bill.\"\nHow it\u2019s going: \"The DOJ is reportedly investigating whether Rep.

{"label": "true", "claim": "Barack Obama \"Foreign aid makes up about 1 percent of our entire budget.\"", "evidence": "President Barack Obama\u2019s April 13 speech on federal debt and spending contained plenty of interesting claims, and we\u2019ll be checking those in the coming days.\n\nWe wanted to start with with a remark the president made to back up his contention that politicians often focus their deficit-cutting rhetoric on hot-button programs that are just a small portion of the federal budget.\n\nPoliticians in both parties, he said, \"suggest that we can somehow close our entire deficit by eliminating things like foreign aid, even though foreign aid makes up about 1% of our entire budget.\"\n\nWe wondered if foreign aid really makes up such a small portion of federal spending.\n\nIn February, PolitiFact checked a claim by Ross Douthat, a columnist at The New York Times. Douthat said Israel and Egypt receive more foreign aid from Uncle Sam than any other nations. We rated that True, noting that if you exclude the spending on Afghanistan and Iraq, where military operations continue, Israel received $2.4 billion in the 2008 fiscal year, while Egypt got $1.5 billion.\n\nThose 2008 figures came from the U.S. Census 2011 Statistical Abstract. The United States spent a total $49.1 billion on foreign aid that year. According to the Treasury Department and historical tables on the federal budget, total federal spending was $2.98 trillion for the 2008 fiscal year. That means foreign aid made up 1.64 percent of budget.\n\nWhat about 2009? In that fiscal year, according to the U.S. Agency for International Development, the United States spent $44.9 billion, while overall government spending was $3.52 trillion. Foreign aid spending was 1.28 percent of the total budget.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering who else is a major U.S. aid recipient, here\u2019s the rest of the top 10 from 2008: Russia ($1.3 billion), Sudan ($1.2 billion), Tanzania ($1.1 billion), Ethiopia ($1 billion), Pakistan ($963 million), Colombia ($888 million), Jordan ($833 million), and Mozambique ($799 million). The totals reflect both economic and military aid.\n\nSo Obama was almost exactly right in saying foreign aid consumes about 1 percent of the U.S. budget. In fiscal 2008 U.S. foreign aid spending of $49.1 billion made up 1.64 percent of total spending. The next year foreign aid spending was $44.9 billion, or 1.28 percent of the total budget"}
{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Doctors Without Borders Trade deals threaten \"India\u2019s role as the pharmacy of the developing world\" for new HIV medicines.", "evidence": "If there was one success story to emerge from the International AIDS Conference in Durban, South Africa, it was that more people are getting treated for HIV/AIDS than ever before -- about 17 million by the latest United Nations estimate.\nFalling drug prices played a key role in helping providers reach this point. But the international health group Doctors Without Borders (M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res) warned at a press conference that trade negotiations around the world put future gains at risk.\nThe group said its latest report \"examines multiple global threats to access to affordable treatment, including trade deals which threaten India\u2019s role as the \u2018pharmacy of the developing world.\u2019\"\nTrade is at the center of the U.S. presidential election for its effect on the American work force. But is there more at play? We wondered if it\u2019s true that the next round of agreements, both those that involve the United States and those that don\u2019t, would undermine some large drug makers in India.\nWhy India\nIndia matters because thanks to the country\u2019s patent laws, India and generics go together like toast and jam. The rules there make it easier than other places for companies to churn out generic drugs once the patent on the original version runs out. Generics are cheaper than their brand name cousins and if you want to stretch a dollar, you take the generic option.\nDoctors Without Borders said 97 percent of the drugs it uses to treat people with HIV are generics made in India. That includes medicines for HIV itself, as well as for diseases like pneumonia and tuberculosis that hit people with suppressed immune systems.\nDoctors Without Borders is worried less about the drugs it uses today and more about the ones it\u2019s counting on in the future. As the number of people coming in for treatment rises, doctors are finding more who don\u2019t respond to the most common, or first-line, medications. Doctors Without Borders is focused on making second-and-third-line drugs more affordable to keep pace with a growing need, and they see India as the place to make that happen.\nImpact of trade deals\nAlthough the Trans-Pacific Partnership gets a lot of attention in the United States, India is not part of it. But it is part of discussions involving the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a mega-regional pact that aims to tie together 16 countries including China, India, Australia, Japan, South Korea and many other Asian nations. The European Union is also seeking a regional trade agreement with India and other Asian countries.\nBoth of those trade negotiations have sought to get India to tighten its patent laws. The United States has too, through a one-on-one process overseen by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The issues that office has raised mirror ones in the big trade deals.\nThe USTR\u2019s latest report criticizes India\u2019s patent laws, saying \"the pharmaceutical industry in particular faces a host of challenges related to intellectual property rights.\"\nWhat do U.S. trade negotiators not like in particular?\nFor one, India is reluctant to grant new patents for a drug or blend of drugs built around medications that already enjoy patent protection. These so-called secondary patents extend the time for the drug maker to enjoy exclusive production rights. That translates into a chance to charge higher prices.\nAmerican officials also don\u2019t care for India\u2019s rules on clinical trial information. When someone invents a drug, they have to prove it\u2019s safe and effective. That proof is in the trial reports. India lets\u00a0generic drug makers rely on the original clinical trials.\u00a0One way to extend the exclusive right to make a drug is to bar generic drug makers from using that\u00a0data\u00a0for a number of years.\nWould these sorts of changes make life easier for the makers of new drugs and harder for the generic manufacturers?\nWe found no dispute that they would.\nWe talked with independent experts who think India should stand its ground and those who thought it ought to bend, but either way, they agreed on who wins and who loses.\nThere are good arguments on both sides for protecting the profits of companies that invent new drugs, versus\u00a0making drugs more affordable.\u00a0We take no position on the larger question of where the right balance point falls. \u00a0We're focused only on the claim that large trading partners want to move Indian law\u00a0in favor of the inventors of new drugs.\n\n"}
{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Marcia Fudge The so-called doc fix in the fiscal cliff deal will cut payments \"for treating illnesses disproportionately impacting minorities, including end stage renal disease and diabetes.\"", "evidence": "If you read about the fiscal-cliff deal Congress made on New Year\u2019s Day, one fact above others stood out. Through compromises -- more unsavory or unprincipled to some than to others -- \u00a0America\u2019s economy did not topple over.\n\nNeither side got everything it wanted, noted U.S. Rep. Marcia Fudge, a Warrensville Heights Democrat who voted for the deal. One compromise in particular still leaves Fudge uneasy: the funding measures used to keep Medicare from cutting its pay to physicians by 26.5 percent. To avert the physician pay cuts, Congress diverted money from several other medical programs, Fudge said in a Jan. 1 news release.\n\nThis took care of the so-called Medicare doc fix -- but it also happened to take money\nfrom programs that pay for \"treating illnesses disproportionately impacting minorities, including end stage renal disease and diabetes,\" Fudge said. She said this must be addressed in the new session of Congress.\n\nDid Congress really get the money to keep paying doctors for treating seniors (via Medicare,) by cutting what it pays hospitals and others for treating diabetes and other diseases? PolitiFact Ohio took a look.\n\u00a0\nIt turns out that Fudge, who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, was correct on the funding. Whether this will harm patients is a matter of debate. Government accountants have wanted some of these changes for some time. Hospitals say the bean counters miss the big picture -- the real cost of treating patients -- by focusing too narrowly on line items.\n\nTo understand this, let\u2019s start with a quick explanation of the doc fix. It is a remnant of laws, the most recent in 1997, designed to hold down federal spending by linking the nation\u2019s rate of economic growth to government payments for providers in Medicare, the 1965 program that brought federal health insurance to retirees.\n\nThe problem is, medical costs often rise much faster than the overall economy (measured \u00a0by the gross domestic product). In recent, low-inflation years, the formula linking the two would automatically require payment cuts to doctors. Some doctors who serve seniors say they might get paid so little that they would stop accepting new patients or quit practicing. So \u00a0Congress halts these reductions every year, though it keeps the law.\n\nThis year\u2019s cut would have been particularly deep because of the cumulative build-up of past deferrals. But as we said, Congress found a fix. It required coming up with about $30 billion to pay.\n\nWhere did the money come from?\n\nAccording to the Kaiser Health News blog, Congress decided to cut the amount that Medicare pays to hospitals for inpatient or overnight care by reducing annual base payment \u00a0increases. This would save $10.5 billion over 10 years, the Kaiser news service said.\n\nCongress found another $4.2 billion by reducing what are known as \u2018disproportionate share\" payments made by Medicaid, the government\u2019s program for low-income Americans, to hospitals that treat an unusually high share of the poor.\n\nAnd it got $4.9 billion by changing the way it bundles payments for treating end-stage renal disease starting in 2014\n\nThere are other changes, including a requirement that companies start competing with bids to sell diabetes test supplies, ending what government auditors say are over-payments. But you get the idea. These and other cuts are detailed in reports by the medical trade press, including The Medicare NewsGroup and Becker\u2019s Hospital Review.\n\nIf this sounds like Congress took from Peter to pay Paul, the president and CEO of the Federation of American Hospitals, Chip Kahn, might agree. He put it that way to Kaiser Health News: \"It is not in the best interest of patients or those who care for them to rob hospital Peter to pay for fiscal cliff Paul.\"\n\nThe American Medical Association also expressed its concerns.\n\nOutrageous? Consider the rationale: Congressional watchdogs maintain these programs were overpaid or abused in the past, and could function in the future with less money.\n\nAccording to several studies and audits by the Government Accountability Office, an investigative agency that reports to Congress, hospitals were overpaid while Medicare transitioned toward paying them a bundled sum for treatment based on a patient\u2019s disease or diagnosis. The old system paid for individual services, treatments and tests, some of them poorly coordinated and duplicative. Overpayments occurred during the transition that started in 2008.\n\nAdditionally, some ambulance services were overpaid for emergency transport of diabetes patients who did not need emergency or ambulance services, according to examinations by the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services. By cutting such payments by 10 percent, starting next October, Congress freed up additional money for the doc fix.\n\nAnd the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services paid for more dialysis-related drugs -- as much as $880 million in 2011 -- than patients with kidney failure actually used, according to a December, 2012, GAO report. This was due to a bundled-payment calculation that did not account for a significant drop in the usage of certain drugs -- 23 percent lower in 2011 than in 2007, the GAO found.\n\nThe GAO specifically recommended that Congress tweak the law so CMS had clear authority to alter its dialysis payment calculations. Congress did so as part of the fiscal cliff and doc fix deal.\n\nBut the medical industry is unhappy about this and the other cuts.

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Scott Walker \u201cThe U.S. Senate cannot convict a former President.\u201d", "evidence": "Former President Donald Trump is staring down his second impeachment trial in as many years, but uncertainty looms over the unprecedented proceedings.\nThat\u2019s because despite 245 years of history and 21 past impeachments by the U.S. House, the country has no direct precedent for an impeachment trial of a president who has left office.\nThe House impeached Trump Jan. 13, 2021, for his role inciting the Capitol mob on Jan. 6. A trial is set to begin Feb. 8 in the U.S. Senate, but, of course, Trump has since departed the White House, having lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden.\nThe resulting procedural question has given rise to an array of claims about what exactly the U.S. Constitution says on the matter, including one from former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.\n\"The U.S. Senate cannot convict a former President,\" the longtime Republican politician said in a Facebook post Jan. 26. He then repeated the sentence nine more times for emphasis. Walker also repeated the claim on Twitter, truncated to four repetitions due to the 280-character limit.\nBut if 2020 taught us anything, it\u2019s that saying something over and over on the internet doesn\u2019t make it true.\nSo let\u2019s take a closer look.\nArguments on both sides\nDespite the confident assertion from Walker \u2014 now president of Young America\u2019s Foundation, which seeks to introduce young people to conservative values \u2014 this is far from a settled topic.\nThe core Constitutional section here is Article II, Section 4, which says, \"The President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\" Article I specifies the two potential penalties in play are removal from office and disqualification from holding federal office in the future.\nRemoval is obviously off the table at this point, but disqualification is a highly relevant consequence given Trump is said to be considering a 2024 run for president.\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Research Service dove deep into the precedent and constitutional interpretation in a Jan. 15 publication. They summarized their findings this way:\n\"The Constitution does not directly address whether Congress may impeach and try a former President for actions taken while in office,\" the six-page brief said. \"Though the text is open to debate, it appears that most scholars who closely examined the question have concluded that Congress has authority to extend the impeachment process to officials who are no longer in office.\"\nSome key points the publication lists in support of a trial for a former president:\n\n\nIn 1876, the Senate ruled a former secretary of war could face an impeachment trial for actions taken in office even though he had since resigned (more on this in a bit).\n\n\nThe U.S. impeachment process was set up with the British system in mind, where former officials could be impeached. The framers made many \"highly specific decisions about the impeachment process that departed from the British practice\" but \"chose not to explicitly rule out impeachment after an official leaves office.\"\n\n\nMany scholars have argued simple logic dictates impeachment remain an option. If impeachment didn\u2019t extend to someone no longer in office, any official could elude punishment by simply committing offenses late enough in the term, or by resigning once the impeachment process began. And Congress could never bar an official from holding future office as long as that person resigns first.\n\n\nIn the only discussion of the timing of impeachment at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, most members took it for granted that the President would be impeachable after he left office.\n\n\nFormer President John Quincy Adams clearly interpreted this as a non-expiring penalty. While serving as a Congressman after leaving the White House in 1846, he told Congress, \"I hold myself, so long as I have the breath of life in my body, amenable to impeachment by this House for everything I did during the time I held any public office.\"\u00a0\n\n\nKey points against a trial for a former president\n\n\nThe plain text of the Constitution, that \"[t]he President, Vice President and all Civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment ... and Conviction,\" could be read literally as only applying to officials who are holding office during impeachment proceedings.\n\n\nU.S. Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story wrote in his influential Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States (1833) that impeachment doesn\u2019t apply to officials who have left their position because removal is no longer necessary.\n\n"}
{"label": "half-true", "claim": "The Tax Foundation Says Tennessee has some of the lowest beer excise tax rates in the country.", "evidence": "Editor\u2019s note: On Friday we published an item that ruled as False a claim the Tax Foundation made with a map that shows Tennessee ranking among the lowest in the nation in beer excise taxes. That item incorrectly characterized the map, which was labeled \"State Beer Excise Tax Rates,\" as displaying overall tax rates on beer. We have changed the ruling statement to the more narrow definition of \"beer excise taxes\" and adjusted our ruling.\n----\n\nA map published by The Tax Foundation makes it look like Tennesseans can get a cold one without paying too much in taxes.\n\nOn the March 5 map, titled \"State Beer Excise Tax Rates (Dollars Per Gallon),\" Tennessee is ranked No. 39, at $0.14 per gallon, well behind the top three states of Alaska ($1.07), Alabama ($1.05) and Georgia ($1.01).\n\nThis led to media reports saying that Tennessee has some of the lowest beer taxes in the nation, including one blog post that led with: \"Tennessee may be in the Bible Belt, but its taxes on beer . . . are among the lowest in the country.\"\"\n\nBut Linus Hall, brewmaster for one of Tennessee\u2019s most successful craft breweries, Yazoo Brewing, pushed back on Twitter: \"Do your homework! TN has 17% wholesale tax on top of excise tax, giving us the highest beer taxes in the country!\"\n\nIndeed, for years the Tennessee Malt Beverage Association, which represents beer wholesalers, has contended that the taxes Tennesseans pay for beer are among of the highest in the nation, so we decided to look into the claim.\n\nThe Tax Foundation map lists Tennessee\u2019s flat per-barrel excise tax paid directly to the state, which has for many years stayed constant at $4.29 per barrel. Since there are 31 gallons in a barrel, that translates to about 14 cents per gallon, which is pretty low compared with flat per-barrel rates levied by other states. A color-coded map key puts Tennessee in the \"Low Beer Tax\" category.\n\nAn \"excise tax\" is \"an indirect tax charged on the sale of a particular good,\" according to the website Investopedia. It is considered indirect \"because the government does not directly apply the tax. An intermediary, either the producer or merchant, is charged and then must pay the tax to the government.\"\n\nThe industry\u2019s national lobbying arm, the Beer Institute, calculates Tennessee\u2019s beer excise tax rate by also including the 17-percent wholesale beer tax referenced by Yazoo\u2019s brewmaster (the Institute does the same thing for Kentucky\u2019s 11-percent wholesale beer tax). That tax, mandated by the state but applied and collected at the local level, pushes Tennessee\u2019s beer tax to $35.61 per barrel, the highest in the nation by the Institute\u2019s rankings (Kentucky moves from 45th in the Foundation rankings to seventh in the Beer Institute\u2019s).\n\nPut another way -- in 2010, a total of $16.6 million in beer tax revenue was collected by the state for its flat $4.29 per-barrel tax, but $122 million in beer tax revenue was collected by local governments for the 17-percent wholesale beer tax mandated by the state. For the consumer, these beer taxes are unavoidable, although as any beer-loving resident of a border county can tell you, beer is often cheaper in Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia (even if the Tax Foundation map suggests otherwise).\n\nWe found inconsistencies in the Tax Foundation's map. A footnote says, \"Local rates are excluded unless they are statewide and uniform. Alabama and Georgia include statewide local rates.\" But we found that standard was not applied to Tennessee, which has a 17-percent wholesale tax on beer that is statewide, uniform and mandatory. Including the revenue it produces would push the state to No. 1 on the Tax Foundation\u2019s rankings, just as it is ranked by the Beer Institute.\n\nAn email challenging our False ruling from Tax Foundation vice president for legal and state projects, Joseph Henchman, said a more appropriate ruling would be \"True But Not Comprehensive.\" Richard Morrison, manager of communications for Tax Foundation, wrote in an email: \"Yes, multiple taxes affect the ultimate price of beer in Tennessee \u2013 and if we had wanted to do an in-depth study on how the final retail price if beer is affected by all of those taxes, we would have. But that\u2019s not what we did, and it\u2019s not what we said we did.\"\n\nStill, there is that footnote on the map that indicates the Tax Foundation included local tax rates in making Alabama and Georgia Nos. 2 and 3 in its rankings and it also says the ranking includes it applies \"sales taxes specific to alcoholic beverages\" in Maryland, Minnesota and D.C. So we find the map is inconsistent and misleading.\n\nScott Drenkard, an economist with the Tax Foundation, said the organization got its excise tax figures from the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS), which represents the liquor industry and had the most recent data available, September 2011. He said it can \"get a little hairy\" trying to factor in all the various state and local taxes on beer, but in an email Monday said the Tax Foundation\u2019s map attempts to include what he called \"statutory\" tax rates and not \"effective\" rates. He also said local alcohol-specific sales taxes were included in calculating the excise tax rate for beer in Arkansas.\n\n\"A statutory rate is the legally imposed rate, whereas the effective rate is what is actually paid when the smoke clears.\" He explained later in the email: \"The map does not purport to be anything more than it is: a statutory excise tax rate map on beer at the point of sale.\"\n\nDrenkard said the Tax Foundation ultimately determined that the Tennessee wholesale tax on beer, despite being uniform and statewide, fell into the \"effective\" tax rate category and not the \"statutory\" one: \"Tennessee has a \u2018wholesale\u2019 tax levied on the wholesale price, but collected at the retail level. Is this properly considered a wholesale tax, or a retail tax? We think this is simply a judgment call.\"\n\nRich Foge, a lobbyist for Tennessee\u2019s Malt Beverage Assocation, and Jason Baird, Foge\u2019s counterpart in Kentucky, both were surprised rankings of beer excise rates would exclude the high wholesale beer tax rates in both states. Lester Jones, the Beer Institute\u2019s economist, makes his rankings of beer excise tax rates include things like city-specific beer and alcohol taxes, and says Tennessee and Kentucky\u2019s wholesale beer taxes -- mandated statewide but paid at the local level -- should definitely be included.\n\n\"If you are going to include local taxes for Georgia and Alabama and other states and not include ours, then that map is false,\" Foge said. He added that it concerned him that DISCUS, which lobbies for liquor, was used as the Tax Foundation\u2019s source on beer taxes. \"Those are our competitors,\" Foge said. Drenkard said DISCUS figures were used because they were more recent than the Beer Institute\u2019s tables showing breakdowns effective excise beer taxes for 2009 and 2010.\n\nHall, the Yazoo brewmaster, said that by including some local tax rates and not others, he felt the Tax Foundation had created a \"misleading\" map. \"Anybody who wasn\u2019t familiar would look at that map and get the opposite impression of what the truth is,\" Hall said.\n\nFoge contends that even the Beer Institute\u2019s calculation of Tennessee\u2019s highest-in-the-nation $35.61 per barrel in beer taxes doesn\u2019t tell the whole taxing story. That\u2019s because when you buy a six-pack at the supermarket, you also pay sales tax on the purchase \u2013 an average of 9.25 percent statewide (state sales tax is 7 percent and local governments can tack on up to another 2.7 percent). See this PolitiFact item for our ruling on Tennessee\u2019s high sales and grocery taxes being among the nation\u2019s highest.\n\nThe wholesale tax is paid by beer wholesalers based on the value of the beer at wholesale level (including their profit markup), which varies from brand to brand. But when the 17 percent is added, that becomes part of the price at the retail level. Thus, Foge notes, the sales tax is in fact \"a tax on taxes.\"\n\nSince the wholesale tax is based on value, it increases as prices increase for beer \u2013 as they have over the years. Thus, the wholesale beer tax the state mandates be paid at the local level rises as beer prices go up while the flat \"per barrel\" beer tax paid directly to the state remains stable.\n\nHall, the brewmaster, said Tennessee\u2019s taxes on beer mean Yazoo makes a higher profit off beer sold in other states, even factoring in shipping costs. Foge said that\u2019s a big reason why many Tennesseans in the beer business find it \"infuriating\" when reports fail to include the wholesale beer tax when calculating Tennessee\u2019s overall\u00a0beer excise taxes.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe Tax Foundation published beer excise tax figures that included local taxes for other states, but excluded Tennessee and Kentucky\u2019s wholesale beer taxes. While the map is accurate that Tennessee has a flat per-barrel beer excise tax of $0.14 per gallon, excluding the statewide wholesale beer tax creates a misleading impression that Tennessee\u2019s beer taxes are among the lowest in the nation"}

Joe Manchin told MSNBC\u2019s Kasie Hunt that the opioid crisis is destroying families and wrecking the state\u2019s economic future.\n\"I've got the greatest workers in the world,\" Manchin said on Oct. 22. \"But I'm down to around 50 percent of the adult workers who are actually working now because of addiction or conviction.\"\nWe wondered to what extent opioids are to blame for low employment in West Virginia.\nManchin\u2019s office told us he learned about the effect opioid abuse has on the state\u2019s employment through \"hundreds of meetings with business executives, state workforce and labor experts, at his job fairs and with community leaders across the state.\" The office also clarified Manchin\u2019s comment, saying people who struggle with addiction or have been convicted in crimes related to opioid use in the past often have trouble getting jobs.\nExperts agreed that the opioid crisis affects employment rates in West Virginia, but they don\u2019t know how much.\nMeasuring the workforce\nManchin is about on the mark when he says about half of West Virginia\u2019s adults are employed. What\u2019s less certain is the role opioid abuse plays.\nTo measure this, the Bureau of Labor Statistics looks at two key figures: the \u00a0employment-population ratio (the percentage of people over the age of 16 who are employed) and the labor force participation rate (the percentage of people over the age of 16 who are either employed or actively looking for a job).\nThe latest estimates place West Virginia at a 50.4 percent employment-population ratio and a 53.1 percent labor force participation rate in September. By comparison, the United States\u2019 employment-participation ratio in September was at 60.4 percent and the labor force participation rate was 63.1 percent.\n(Because the labor force doesn\u2019t typically include students and retirees, college towns or populations with more elderly individuals might sometimes appear to have lower workforce participation.)\nWest Virginia has historically had one of the lowest labor participation rates in the United States. Since the late 1970s, as far back as the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 data on labor participation rates goes, the state\u2019s rate has remained below 58 percent. Similarly, the employment-population ratio has not exceeded 55 percent.\nA 2015 study of West Virginia\u2019s labor participation rate conducted by the West Virginia Center on Budget & Policy found that the state\u2019s higher-than-average elderly population, percentage of people on work disability and poor overall health were major factors in the participation rate. In addition, lower rates of educational attainment beyond a high school degree had prevented young workers from obtaining jobs that require more education.\n\n"}

{"label": "pants-fire", "claim": "Delia Lopez A bill by Earl Blumenauer would \"mandate GPS tracking devices on all our vehicles.\"", "evidence": "Rep. Earl Blumenauer wants to know where you are and where you\u2019re going. At least that\u2019s what his Republican challenger has been telling voters these days on her website and in talk radio appearances. According to Republican congressional hopeful Delia Lopez, Blumenauer sponsored a bill that would put \"GPS tracking devices on all our vehicles.\"\n\nHere\u2019s her grievance in detail::\n\n\"Earl Blumenauer is the sponsor of HR-3311 to mandate GPS tracking devices on all our vehicles. To track our every mile and know everywhere we go. The pilot program will waste hundreds of millions of dollars at a time when we are already deep in debt and spending too much. ... This bill is designed to transition us to a per mile vehicle tax system called The Road User Fee Pilot Project and would be administered by the Treasury Department otherwise know as the IRS. This system will track all American cars using a new form of taxation. Cars will be taxed by the mileage they drive. Under the bill the IRS or Treasury will appropriate $154,000,000 of taxpayers money in the form of free grants to well connected commercial manufactures. It means that every car in America will be tracked through whatever method they choose. This constitutes absolute surveillance whether on public or private property, welcome to another attack on the 4th amendment.\"\n\nSounds more than a little Orwellian, right? The government, with one little-noticed bill, is going to start tracking your every vehicular movement. Or is it? PolitiFact Oregon decided to dig into this claim, which has been making the rounds on conservative websites even outside the state.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s start with the basics: It\u2019s true that Blumenauer is the sponsor of H.R. 3311, and it\u2019s also true that the bill, if passed, would cost the government a little over $154 million. But beyond that, Lopez\u2019s argument doesn\u2019t track. \u00a0\n\nA reading of the actual bill shows that, rather than install GPS tracking devices into all cars nationwide, Blumenauer is looking to set up a national pilot program that would test alternative ways of taxing road use. This shouldn\u2019t be too new to Oregonians. For more than a decade, state policy makers have been trying to figure out how to pay for road maintenance once gas taxes drop because hybrids and electric cars rule the roads.\n\nIt\u2019s true, GPS could be used in one or more the programs that might spring up if this bill becomes law. In Oregon\u2019s own statewide pilot program, the Department of Transportation used GPS as its main method of tracking mileage. But, as Blumenauer spokesman Willie Smith points out, GPS is just one way to go about this, and, in fact, there\u2019s no stipulation in the bill that GPS (which isn\u2019t even mentioned in the legislation) be a part of the trial program. \"There\u2019s a number of methods for this,\" Smith said. \"Our bill doesn\u2019t prescribe one way or another.\"\n\nPolitiFact Oregon reads the bill the same way.\n\nMoreover, it should be noted that the bill includes a provision that all pilot programs be evaluated on the basis of a few criteria, including \"protection of personal privacy.\"\n\nCandidate Lopez, however, remains unconvinced. \"I think it\u2019s quite plain that the idea in there is to put the GPS tracking in all of our vehicles,\" she said. \"It may be squirmy verbiage that\u2019s put in there. They don\u2019t want to admit that this is exactly what they want to do.\"\n\nSquirmy verbiage or not, a $154 million pilot program with no specific mandates for GPS and a clause that keeps an eye out for personal privacy is miles away from Lopez\u2019s description of a bill that would mandate tracking devices in \"all our vehicles.\"\n\nLopez is significantly distorting what Blumenauer's bill would do and ignoring the fact that GPS isn't even mentioned in it"}

The state of Georgia manages its money on a 12-month timetable that begins July 1 and ends June 30. \n\nMillar added in an email and during a telephone interview to emphasize his point that the state had not made drastic cuts in education spending.\n\n\"It\u2019s the least-touched major area\" in terms of cuts, Millar said.\n\nA few days after we started to examine Millar\u2019s statement, the AJC reported that Gov. Nathan Deal and his budget staff have asked departments to come up with an additional $553 million in budget cuts by the 2014 budget cycle. The major portion of public school funding is exempt, the AJC reported.\n\nThe senator said he was thinking about the years since Deal took office or Sonny Perdue\u2019s last year as governor when he made his claim to the AJC. He said spending may have even increased during those years. We followed his suggestion of examining data from the Georgia Office of Planning and Budget to calculate recent state spending.\n\nPolitiFact Georgia looked at state spending since Deal took office in 2011 and from 2009, the year after the Great Recession began making an impact on state and local budgets.\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown on education spending in recent fiscal years:\n\nFY 2009:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $8.20 billion.\nFY 2010:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $6.59 billion.\nFY 2011:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $7.07 billion.\nFY 2012:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $6.97 billion.\nFY 2013:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $7.17 billion.\n\nWe found several state agencies with a smaller percentage of budget cuts. We considered what Millar said about the sizable chunk of money spent on k-12 education and focused on departments with large budgets.\n\nPolitiFact Georgia examined spending among the 10 departments with the largest current budgets, including four with current budgets greater than $1 billion. The K-12 budget is still about 20 times greater than technical colleges, the department with the 10th-largest budget.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at spending since Deal took office. The Education Department\u2019s budget rose by slightly more than 1 percent between FY 2011 and the current budget. Not a great deal of change there and not a decrease.\n\nWhat about the two most recently completed budget cycles? Between FY 2011 and FY 2012, the Education Department\u2019s budget declined by slightly more than 1 percent. Of the 10 departments with the largest budgets, that was the smallest decrease. Five departments had budget increases, some as high as about 15 percent, as was the case for the Department of Community Health.\n\nLet\u2019s examine spending since the recession. Since FY 2009, the Education Department\u2019s budget declined by 12.5 percent. Of those with billion-dollar budgets, the Corrections Department was the only one with a smaller decrease, which was about 3 percent. Two other departments with large budgets -- transportation and technical colleges -- also had smaller percentage decreases of 8.5 percent and 11.2 percent, respectively. Again, there were some departments with budget increases. \n\nMillar countered that the state had no choice but to increase spending in some areas, such as the Department of Community Health, which oversees Georgia\u2019s Medicaid program. State officials estimate they\u2019ll have to spend about $4 billion in coming years to comply with the federal health care law.\n\nMillar maintained he had a good argument, despite the spending increases for departments and smaller budget cuts in other areas.\n\n\"On balance, if you look at the numbers, I still think it\u2019s a fair statement,\" the senator said of his initial statement.\n\nSo where does this leave us?\n\nMillar\u2019s larger point is that the state has not made major cuts in education spending in comparison with other larger departments since Deal took office. \n\nThe 1 percent cut in education spending between FY 2011 and FY 2012 was the smallest among 10 of Georgia\u2019s largest departments and among those with billion-dollar budgets, which supports Millar\u2019s quote in the AJC. Millar\u2019s argument loses some steam when examining spending between FY 2009 and now. We found a few larger departments with smaller percentage cuts than education. Additionally, there are some large departments with budget increases. \n\nMillar\u2019s quote is accurate on some levels, but there are some details we found that lower his grade-point average on this statement"}
{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Progress Texas \"The Confederate battle flag never flew over Texas, but... you might soon see it on our license plates.\"", "evidence": "Talk about opening with a bang: \"The Confederate battle flag never flew over Texas,\" Matt Glazer opens an opinion article posted online Oct. 20, 2011 by the Austin American-Statesman, \"but if Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson gets his way, you might soon see it on our license plates.\"\n\nGlazer is executive director of Progress Texas, a liberal education and advocacy group, which has urged the board overseeing the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles to reject a request by the Texas division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, and sponsored by Patterson, to permit license plates emblazoned with a red, white and blue flag design tracing to the Confederacy (see the proposed design here) including these words: \"Sons of Confederate Veterans.\"\n\nThe image, sometimes called the rebel flag or Dukes of Hazzard flag, hearkens to the battle flag of the Confederacy\u2019s Army of Northern Virginia, whose general was Robert E. Lee. An article on Texas flags in the Handbook of Texas Online describes the battle flag of the Army of Northern Virginia as a square having a red ground with a blue saltire, meaning diagonal cross, \"bordered with white and emblazoned with white five-pointed stars corresponding in number to that of the Confederate States.\"\n\nThe flag\u2019s look also has long been the identifying emblem of the Sons of Confederate Veterans.\n\nSo, that flag never flew over Texas?\n\nTo our inquiry, Glazer initially pointed out remarks by Austin lawyer Gary Bledsoe, president of the state NAACP conference, at the motor vehicle board\u2019s Oct. 12, 2011, meeting. A news story in the American-Statesman quoted Bledsoe saying: \"This particular flag never flew over Texas.\" And according to the agency\u2019s video of his appearance, Bledsoe continued: \"Let me say that again; this particular flag never flew over Texas.\" He urged the board not to consider the design, which he said has been adopted by hate groups to intimidate and offend others.\n\nUp to three flags of the Confederate States of America may have flown over the Texas Capitol in the war\u2019s four years, experts later told us, and while none of them was the flag of Lee\u2019s army, two incorporated its look.\n\nHouston lawyer Charles Spain Jr., author of the Handbook of Texas entry on flags that have flown over Texas, pointed us to a 1997 report by the Texas Historical Commission on the flags that flew over Texas in its unusual history as a republic and as part of Spain, Mexico, France, the Confederacy and the United States.\n\nThe commission report, which Glazer said he also leaned on for his claim, says the first flag of the Confederate States of America, which was in place for more than two years, included a red field with a white space extending horizontally through the center; the sought license plate design bears no resemblance.\n\nThe nation\u2019s second flag, which flew from May 1863 to March 4, 1865, had a blank white field. But its \"hoist\" corner, the one at the top part closest to the flag pole, was the battle flag of the Army of Northern Virginia, the article says. Toward the end of the war, the flag gave way to a third national flag keeping the battle flag imagery in its hoist corner while adding a red vertical bar down the flag\u2019s white fly.\n\nPut another way, then, a flag with a corner like the license plate design flew over Texas for about two years.\n\nWe realized, though, there\u2019s another wrinkle. Battle flags, in themselves, would not have been lofted over government buildings. Battle flags were carried by groups of soldiers. For insight on this aspect, we contacted George Forgie, a University of Texas associate professor of history specializing in the Civil War. Forgie referred us to Jeff Hunt, director of the Texas Military Forces Museum at Austin\u2019s Camp Mabry, who described battle flags as important military tools enabling generals to locate units and track movements on the field.\n\nHunt said, too, that versions of the flag of the Army of Northern Virginia were carried by Texas units during the war.\n\nIndeed, Hunt said, a version of the battle flag of the Army of Northern Virginia was carried at the Battle of Palmetto Ranch, the last of the war, which occurred near Brownsville, Texas, on May 12-13, 1865, well after Lee surrendered. Hunt, who has written a book on the battle, said it took place even though both sides knew Lee\u2019s Army had surrendered.\n\nGlazer stuck by his published claim, saying it doesn\u2019t make sense to focus on flags that only had the distinctive imagery in a corner which, he noted by email, is not the same as a flag in itself. Glazer also objected to \"expanding\" the definition of battle flags to include \"flags that ever flew \u2018in\u2019 Texas, or any altered flags. That would expand the definition of Texas flags to historic flags like the famous \u2018Come and Take It\u2019 flag, athletic flags raised by sports teams outside stadiums, fraternity and sorority flags, commercial flags from Fortune 500 companies and thousands of others I can't even think of.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe group\u2019s statement reflects the unchallenged fact that the battle flag of the Army of Northern Virginia did not fly over the Texas Capitol. However, the image on the requested license plate looks a lot like the most noticeable feature of the second and third national flags of the Confederacy, which did fly over Texas. Also, a version of the flag of the Army of Northern Virginia was carried by Texans in a Texas battle"}

Kelly Loeffler, the race will determine which party controls the Senate.\nAs for town halls, Perdue\u2019s Senate office did not cite any that Perdue has held.\nOssoff\u2019s claim about donor access refers to a solicitation for a Perdue campaign fundraising event. That invitation shows political action committees that contributed $7,500 annually (not a single contribution) would qualify to attend quarterly events and an annual \"sea island retreat.\"\nNo evidence of town halls\nA town hall, as it\u2019s typically understood, is a meeting that is publicized in advance and open to the public, in which the elected representative answers questions from members of the public that are not screened. Traditionally, these have been in-person events, but particularly since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, more have been held online.\nWe found no evidence that Perdue has held such a meeting, and his office didn\u2019t offer any.\nOssoff has been making the town halls claim about Perdue since at least August, and we found several media reports about Perdue not holding public forums.\nIn May, the student-run Harvard Political Review reported that Perdue had not held any town halls since he took office in January 2015. Atlanta TV station WGCL reported in August about Perdue\u2019s lack of accessibility to the public, and noted the Harvard story. In September, Atlanta TV station WXIA referred in a news report to a 2017 Perdue event that drew protesters. It didn\u2019t describe the event, but said Perdue hasn\u2019t held a town hall since then.\u00a0\nPerdue\u2019s staff did not respond to those reporters for those stories. But in 2017, Perdue told reporters he had held \"impromptu\" town hall meetings while making an unannounced visit to the state Capitol, and that he prefers holding meetings with individuals or small groups.\nThe nonprofit Town Hall Project told PolitiFact that Perdue has not held a public town hall since it began tracking town halls held by members of Congress\u00a0in January 2017. The project uses staff and volunteer researchers to track lawmakers\u2019 public schedules, subscribe to their newsletters, follow them on social media and visit their websites, said executive director Nathan Williams.\u00a0\nAccording\u00a0to the Town Hall Project, a meeting is a town hall if it is open to the public and the press; announced with at least 24 hours\u2019 notice; and has at least 30 minutes of open questions and answers; that is, the questions are not screened.\nPerdue's Senate office told PolitiFact that he regularly participates \"in public events and local visits to hear directly from\" constituents. The office did not cite any town hall event, either in person or online, but said Perdue has held \"constituent conference calls\" since taking office, including weekly calls during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n"}
{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "George Will \"When we started this health care debate a year ago, 85 percent of the American people had health insurance, and 95 percent of the 85 percent were happy with it.\"", "evidence": "As the debate over health care reform moves slowly toward a climax, Republicans and other critics have argued that the public has made clear its opposition to the Democratic approach.\n\nOn the Feb. 21, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, conservative columnist George Will -- a critic of the plan backed by President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats -- cited poll figures about Americans' satisfaction with their own health coverage.\n\n\"When we started this health care debate a year ago, 85 percent of the American people had health insurance, and 95 percent of the 85 percent were happy with it,\" Will said during the show's roundtable discussion. \"So there was no underlying discontent that you now postulate to drive this radical change.\"\n\nWe thought it would be worth checking whether Americans are really so enthusiastic about their health coverage.\n\nFirst, we'll dispatch with Will's claim that 85 percent of Americans had health insurance. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the leading arbiter of the number of uninsured Americans, Will is exactly on the mark. In the last Census Bureau study, 255.1 million Americans had health insurance in 2008, while 46.3 million did not. That's 84.6 percent, or rounding up, 85 percent -- just as Will said.\n\nNow, for the polling data.\n\nWe were able to find eight surveys taken in 2008 and 2009 that asked Americans whether they were satisfied with their health coverage. We ruled out poll questions that asked about satisfaction with the costs of health care, which we decided goes beyond the scope of Will's comment. To conform with Will's formulation, we also ruled out polls that questioned people who lack insurance in addition to those who have it. Our two-year search period covers a longer time than Will's phrasing of \"a year ago,\" but doing so provides us with a much wider sampling of polls to choose from.\n\nTypically, the polls we located offered their respondents four or five possible choices. Most common was \"very satisfied,\" \"somewhat satisfied,\" \"somewhat dissatisfied,\" or \"very dissatisfied.\" One poll, sponsored by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, added another category: \"extremely satisfied.\"\n\nTo determine whether respondents of a given poll were \"happy\" with their health insurance -- as Will phrased it -- we lumped together the percentages for \"very satisfied,\" \"somewhat satisfied\" and, where applicable, \"extremely satisfied.\"\n\nHere's what we found, poll by poll, in reverse chronological order:\n\n\u2022 Quinnipiac University, Sept. 2009. \"How satisfied are you with your health insurance plan?\" 54 percent very satisfied, 34 percent somewhat. Total: 88 percent satisfaction.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u2022 Quinnipiac University, June 2009. \"How satisfied are you with your health insurance plan?\" 49 percent very satisfied, 36 somewhat satisfied.

Your health insurance coverage.\" 42 percent very satisfied, 39 percent somewhat satisfied. Total: 81 percent satisfaction.\n\n\u2022 Mathew Greenwald & Associates for the Employee Benefit Research Institute, May 2009. \"Overall, how satisfied are you with your current health insurance plan?\" 21 percent extremely satisfied, 37 percent very satisfied, 30 percent somewhat satisfied.

Your health insurance coverage.\" 42 percent very satisfied, 39 percent somewhat satisfied. Total: 81 percent satisfaction.\n\n\u2022 Mathew Greenwald & Associates for the Employee Benefit Research Institute, Aug. 2008. \"Please rate your satisfaction with each of the following aspects of your health care. ... Quality of health care I receive through my (health insurance) plan.\" 31 percent extremely satisfied, 41 percent very satisfied, 23 somewhat satisfied. Total: 95 percent satisfaction.\n\n\u2022 Mathew Greenwald & Associates for the Employee Benefit Research Institute, Aug. 2008. \"Please rate your satisfaction with each of the following aspects of your health care. ... Overall satisfaction with my health (insurance) care plan.\" 23 percent extremely satisfied, 38 percent very satisfied, 30 percent somewhat satisfied. Total: 91 percent satisfaction.\n\n\u2022 Mathew Greenwald & Associates for the Employee Benefit Research Institute, May 2008. \"Overall, how satisfied are you with your current health insurance plan?\" 17 percent extremely satisfied, 36 percent very satisfied, 33 percent somewhat satisfied. Total: 86 percent satisfaction.\n\nIf you average these eight scores, the total rate of satisfaction is 87 percent. In all but one poll, the satisfaction level was below Will's stated level of 95 percent.\n\nOne poll, taken five months before Obama was inaugurated, did come up with 95 percent satisfaction. But alone among these eight polls, that survey asked participants about the \"quality of health care I receive through my (health insurance) plan.\" While we decided that the wording was close enough to merit inclusion on our list, the modest difference in satisfaction levels may stem from the way the question was phrased. Many people feel more warmly toward their doctors than they do toward their insurers.\n\nSo, while one poll with unique wording pegged satisfaction at 95 percent, the average of all relevant polls over a two-year period was eight points lower than what Will cited. However, Will is correct that the levels of satisfaction with one's own health insurance are consistently high. Indeed, they're extraordinarily high, when one considers how rarely surveys find such high levels of agreement among Americans"}

While Governor Walker might be fond of anti-worker and tea party rhetoric, the facts aren't on his side.\"\n\nQuinn\u2019s hit list ended with this:\n\n\"Governor Walker's budget increases state spending by over $1 billion, which is primarily paid for by tax increases on seniors, families with children, and home owners. His budget calls for raising property taxes by nearly \u2026 $500 billion.\"\n\nIn an earlier item we confirmed that Walker signed a two-year budget that raised spending by more than $1 billion, a 1.8% increase over the biennium. Most of the increase was in Medicaid programs, which are entitlements.\n\nBut did the budget lead to $500 billion in property tax increases? Hasn\u2019t Walker been touting a property tax freeze?\n\nRight out of the gate we found a problem with Quinn\u2019s number.\n\nThe day after Quinn\u2019s email, we asked his campaign about the figure. Five days later we were told it was a typo that was being corrected. They meant $500 million, not billion.\n\nBy that time, the higher figure has been reprinted in a Rockford newspaper editorial and on political blogs in both states.\n\nScott Belsky, executive director of Quinn\u2019s campaign organization, subsequently told us the exact figure they are referring to is $483.8 million. The figure, he said, is from Walker\u2019s cut in two tax credits for low-income homeowners and working families, plus \"increasing taxes on local levels of government.\"\n\nSure enough, that number or something close to it was cited by various Democrats after Walker signed the budget in June 2011. They did their math using estimates published in July 2011 by the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the state\u2019s nonpartisan budget scorekeeper.\n\nThat\u2019s a great source, but the Fiscal Bureau report didn\u2019t actually use the $483.8 million number in estimating the total property tax increase for two years.\n\nFiscal Bureau official Rick Olin said their estimate is better stated as $338 million -- that comes from a comparison of estimated 2012 tax levies with the pre-Walker base year of 2010.\n\nGoing for the worst-sounding math (just as Republicans have done in the past), Democrats took the estimates for each of the two Walker years and compared them to the 2010 base.\n\n\"Nobody thinks about it that way,\" said Olin, a fiscal analyst on property taxes.\n\nWhat about the two tax credits Quinn\u2019s campaign cites?\n\nOne was for income taxes, so that\u2019s irrelevant to his claim on property taxes. The other Walker change, on the Homestead credit, did in effect raise property taxes by $13.6 million, state fiscal estimates show.\n\nSo take the $338 million and the $13.6 million and you\u2019re at more than a $350 million increase predicted under Walker\u2019s budget.\n\nBut there\u2019s a much bigger problem for Quinn.\n\nThe numbers were Fiscal Bureau estimates from about nine months ago.\n\nOn April 16, 2012, the day before Quinn\u2019s campaign rolled out the unwelcome mat for Walker, the Wisconsin governor announced hard data on what local governments actually raised property taxes.\n\nThe net levy increase was $21 million (0.2 percent) in year one -- far, far lower than the Fiscal Bureau projection.\n\nIndeed, the owner of a median-valued home actually saw a slight decrease on the property tax bill.\n\nA big reason was the tightened revenue caps Walker and GOP legislators slapped on localities -- creating a virtual tax freeze, with an exception increases tied to new construction. Fewer communities than expected used even the little wiggle room Walker gave them.\n\nSo, while Quinn\u2019s email blamed Walker for property tax decisions made by local officials, the record shows Walker actually sought aggressive controls on local increases.\n\nOur rating\n\nQuinn said his Wisconsin counterpart had increased property taxes nearly $500 billion. That was explained as an old-fashioned typo. But even then, the $500 million is way off.\n\nWhen Walker signed the budget in June 2011, property taxes were estimated to go up $350 million under the most common accounting. That estimate held until the April 16, 2012 report -- and it seems likely Quinn\u2019s email was prepared before Walker\u2019s announcement changed the game.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t correct the million/billion typo in a timely way, and is still using the equally wrong $500 million claim.

Tyler is a former longtime spokesman for former House Speaker Newt Gingrich -- a rival of Romney\u2019s in the GOP presidential primary -- but Winning Our Future is by law unaffiliated with Gingrich\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nTyler wrote back to us to say, \"We don\u2019t make any claim about how many homes Mitt Romney owns.\"\n\nBut at PolitiFact, we do hold politicians -- and super PACs -- accountable for the claims they make to the public. The speaker may have been using a bit of rhetorical excess, but the filmmakers -- in an ad paid for by the Winning Our Future -- chose to air the claim and not dispute it, so we consider it fair game for fact-checking.\n\nWe did a nationwide database search of real estate transactions, deeds and tax records. Initially, our search turned up 16 addresses affiliated in recent years with Mitt Romney or his wife, Ann. But further research enabled us to rule out the bulk of these because they either had been sold or because they represented commercial properties rather than residences.\n\nWe were left with three properties that appear to be residences currently owned by Mitt Romney or his wife:\n\n\u2022 A home in La Jolla, Calif., an affluent ocean front neighborhood adjoining San Diego, Calif. This property, bought by the couple in 2008 for $12 million and assessed at $8.7 million in 2010, has been the subject of news reports that the Romneys plan to tear down the existing house and undertake a significant expansion.

A second, 6.3-acre property nearby, also in Ann Romney\u2019s name, appears to be a combination boathouse and stable with living quarters. It is assessed at $2.5 million.

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "David Axelrod Republicans extended unemployment insurance under President Bush \"when he asked to extend unemployment insurance.\"", "evidence": "Congress has been unable to agree how to boost the economy, creating headaches for President Obama and his Democratic Party.\n\nObama adviser David Axelrod took questions on the issue from Jake Tapper on ABC News' This Week. \"How can the president create jobs without there being any willingness on Capitol Hill to spend money to do so?\" Tapper asked.\n\nAxelrod agreed there is \"not a great appetite\" for additional spending in Congress.\n\n\"But I do think there are some things we still can accomplish. I do think that we can get additional tax relief for small businesses. That's what we want to do, additional lending for small businesses. They're an engine of economic growth. We're hoping we can persuade enough people on the other side of the aisle to put politics aside and join us on that. (And) unemployment insurance, we ought to extend unemployment insurance. People are suffering,\" Axelrod said.\n\n\"You can't get the votes, though,\" Tapper interjected.\n\n\"Well, we'll see. We'll see,\" Axelrod said. \"But at a time when there's one job vacancy for five unemployed workers looking for jobs, clearly we have a responsibility to do it. The Republicans met that responsibility each time under President Bush, when he asked to extend unemployment insurance. They ought to do it now. Let's not play politics with this issue.\"\n\nWe were intrigued by Axelrod's statement that Republicans helped President George W. Bush pass extensions for unemployment insurance. So we decided to fact-check it.\n\nA little background on unemployment insurance: When workers lose full-time work through no fault of their own, they are usually eligible for unemployment benefits, small weekly payments intended to partially make up for lost wages. Employers pay taxes to fund the program, and states administer it based on federal guidelines. How much a person gets and how long benefits are paid varies by state. Usually, the benefits last about six months.\n\nIn tough times, though, Congress often extends benefits, because of the difficulty of finding new jobs when unemployment is very high, as it has been since 2008, when the economy floundered. As a result, Congress has been arguing this summer about extending benefits again after extending them five times since Obama took office in 2009. Recent extensions have been structured so that workers in states where unemployment is higher receive additional weeks of benefits. In the states where unemployment is highest, some unemployed workers have been paid benefits for close to two years.\n\nBut the extensions have run out for some workers, and Congress has been unable to agree on whether to extend them again. That's the context in which Axelrod commented that Republicans extended unemployment for Bush \"when he asked.\"\n\nWe found several instances of President Bush signing into law unemployment insurance extensions. Some extensions were highly targeted, such as aid to airline workers after 9/11 and to victims of Hurricane Katrina. But Bush signed two general extensions in 2003 for 13 weeks each, with significant Republican support. He also signed extensions in 2008 with Republican support.\n\nWe were unable to find any instances when Bush asked for an extension of unemployment benefits and Congress refused him. None of the experts we consulted could recall such a case. So Axelrod was technically right that Bush appears to have gotten Congress to extend unemployment insurance \"when he asked.\"\n\nBut in reviewing news articles on unemployment during the Bush administration, we noticed that, even when they supported extending benefits, Bush and Congressional Republicans were generally more skeptical than Democrats were. We noted that Republicans said then the same thing that some conservatives say now, which is that unemployment payments are a disincentive in some cases to taking a new job. Economists have noted this effect in studies, but they say that it is more significant during normal economic times.\n\nAxelrod's comment implies that Republicans were willing to extend unemployment insurance under Bush but are balking now that Obama is president. But we find the employment landscapes under Bush and Obama so different as to defy comparison. Extensions under Bush usually were for fairly short periods of time, such as two 13-week extensions in 2003.\n\n"}
{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Mitt Romney \"I went to the Olympics that was out of balance, and we got it on balance.\"", "evidence": "The London Games may be only a memory now, but the Olympics remain an issue in the presidential campaign. During the third and final presidential debate in Boca Raton, Fla., Mitt Romney once again cited his experience running the 2002 Winter Olympics as a credential in his bid for the White House.\n\n\"I'm pleased that I've balanced budgets,\" he said. \"I was in the world of business for 25 years. If you didn't balance your budget, you went out of business. I went to the Olympics that was out of balance, and we got it on balance, and made a success there.\"\n\nIs Romney\u2019s claim about the finances of the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics accurate?\n\nFirst, some background. Romney left Bain Capital in early 1999 to take over leadership of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee in the aftermath of a bribery scandal that ultimately exposed widespread corruption in the bidding process used to award the games.\n\nThe scandal forced several of Salt Lake City\u2019s Olympic officials to quit and the mayor to step down, and the committee was reorganized. With two years until the games were set to begin, officials needed someone who help restore credibility to the organization, and they tapped Romney, a Mormon whose family has deep roots in the state and who attended Brigham Young University.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Salt Lake City assignment launched Romney into the national spotlight and helped reboot his political career, catapulting to a successful 2002 gubernatorial campaign in Massachusetts.\n\nAs we analyze Romney\u2019s claim, it\u2019s important to understand that there is not one budget for the Olympic Games -- there are two.\n\nOne is handled by a privately run committee -- in the case of the 2002 Winter Games, the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. The committee collects money from such sources as television rights, ticket sales and sponsorships. Under the rules at the time, this revenue funded the operational costs of the Olympics as well as the costs of building the necessary sports venues.\n\nThe other pot of money comes from government funding -- primarily to cover transportation upgrades and security costs.\n\nThe budget Romney is talking about is the first one, covering Olympic operations. He\u2019s correct that under his stewardship, this budget was balanced -- in fact, more than balanced. According to Fraser Bullock -- a former Bain Capital colleague of Romney\u2019s who joined him at the committee as chief operating officer -- the committee spent $1.3 billion and ended up with a surplus of about $100 million.\n\nRomney is widely credited with creating a sponsorship juggernaut, reeling in such corporations as Allstate, General Mills, Sears Roebuck, certified Angus beef, and Monster.com to sponsor the Games. According to the Washington Post, committee secured 53 deals, more than double the number for the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan. The sponsorships that rolled in after Romney arrived exceeded more than $300 million, perhaps a third of which consisted of local Utah sponsors who had never sponsored the Olympics before, Bullock told the New York Times in 2007.\n\nOn the spending side, Romney disdained the lavish patterns typical of Olympic committees, charging employees a dollar a slice for pizza (served on paper plates) and 25 cents for sodas.\n\n\"When Mitt joined (the committee), there was a budget deficit of $400 million,\" Bullock told PolitiFact. \"So for (the committee), Mitt not only balanced the budget, he produced a surplus, which is remarkable. Only Los Angeles in 1984 also had a surplus. All other Olympics lose money--a lot.\"\n\nThese figures, however, don\u2019t include the second budget. Bullock counts the second budget as reaching $400 million -- $240 million for security (the games came shortly after 9/11, heightening costs) and $160 million for core transportation upgrades, such as interstate interchanges. Bullock says that in many cases the dollars spent on transportation projects were already in the pipeline, but were accelerated to meet the Olympic timetable.\n\nOther observers, however, say the true amount of this second budget was larger than $400 million. On top of this base amount, at least $400 million was spent on a light-rail system. Bullock says local politicians used the Olympics as an opportunity to push through funding for the light rail project, and that he doesn\u2019t consider it spending that was required by the Games. \"I would not for any reason include light rail\" in the calculations, Bullock said. \"We didn\u2019t need it.\"\n\nInvestigative journalists Donald Barlett and James Steele calculated in a 2001 Sports Illustrated article that Congress was spending $1.5 billion in taxpayer dollars on the Salt Lake City Olympics -- \"1.5 times the amount spent by lawmakers to support all seven Olympic Games held in the U.S. since 1904\u2014combined.\" (These figures were adjusted for inflation.)\n\nWe weren\u2019t able to independently verify the $1.5 billion figure, but even the number Bullock accepts -- $400 million -- isn\u2019t a trivial amount of extra dollars. And Kenneth Bullock, a former executive committee member of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee who now directs the of Utah League of Cities and Towns, added that various Utah localities chipped in an unknown number of additional dollars. \"Some of them managed to negotiate reimbursements from (the committee), but even that never would have been enough to pay all of their costs,\" said Kenneth Bullock, who is no relation to Fraser Bullock.\n\nOfficially, Romney had no control over this second budget. But he does appear to have taken an aggressive role in advocating for additional spending. In Romney\u2019s 2004 book, Turnaround: Crisis, Leadership and the Olympic Games, he wrote that he asked his lobbyist \"to bring in more federal funding than had ever been appropriated for any Olympics, summer or winter.\" The committee employed five federal lobbying firms beyond his in-house lobbying office, spending $3.5 million in all, NBC News reported earlier this year. And the Games ended up getting support from at least 18 federal agencies, according to a 2001 Government Accountability Office report.\n\n\"I was successful in organizing the Olympics, got record funds from the federal government,\" Romney said in 2002 as he was running for governor of Massachusetts.\n\nWe asked a number of Olympics experts whether they thought Romney was being accurate when he said he \"balanced the budget\" of the Salt Lake City Olympics. Most agreed that it\u2019s not a simple question.\n\n\"The entire issue of accounting\" for Olympics finances \"is difficult, as it very difficult to know what to count as an Olympic-related cost and what is an infrastructural improvement to the host city,\" said Bill Mallon, co-founder of the International Society of Olympic Historians. \"It can get very complex.\"\n\nStill, most of the experts we asked concluded that Romney was right, but with what David Wallechinsky, the author of several histories of the Olympics, said was \"a major asterisk.\"\n\n\"Romney is right on a technicality that misses the major issue about financing any Olympics,\" said Roger G. Noll, a Stanford University economist who has studied large public infrastructure projects, including stadiums. \"Romney saved the Salt Lake City Olympics by regaining political support. One way he did this was to reduce costs below the plan, but the main reason is that Romney succeeded in getting a huge subsidy from the federal government.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nIt\u2019s correct that Romney more than balanced the the Salt Lake Organizing Committee\u2019s budget. But that doesn\u2019t tell the whole story, since he helped secure at least $400 million -- and possibly up to $1.5 billion -- in government funding to make the Olympics function that is not included in the balance sheet he\u2019s touting. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information"}
{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Barack Obama The U.S. Justice Department has \"taken on more than 100 voting rights cases since 2009.\"", "evidence": "During the week of the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, President Barack Obama gave a fiery speech to Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network Convention in Manhattan in which he attacked Republicans for leading efforts to pass laws \"making it harder, not easier, for people to vote.\"\n\"We're not going to let voter suppression go unchallenged,\" Obama said on April 11. \"So earlier this week you heard from the attorney general, and there's a reason the agency he runs is called the Department of Justice. They've taken on more than 100 voting rights cases since 2009, and they've defended the rights of everybody, from African-Americans to Spanish speakers to soldiers serving overseas.\"\nObama\u2019s statement that the Justice Department had taken on more than 100 voting rights cases since 2009 was disputed by Hans von Spakovsky, a former DOJ lawyer under President George W. Bush who is now an election law expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Spakovsky wrote in a blog that the Justice Department website showed only 39 such cases under Obama. A reader contacted us about the discrepancy, so we decided to fact-check Obama\u2019s statistic.\nVoting Rights Act\nThe Voting Rights Act dates back to 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed it into law shortly after signing the Civil Rights Act. The law was intended to prevent denying the right to vote based on race. Section 5 of the law required the federal government to pre-approve some states\u2019 changes to voting laws, affecting mostly states in the South, including parts of Florida.\nIn June 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the pre-approval provision of the Voting Rights Act in the Shelby County vs. Holder case. With states like Florida, Texas and North Carolina passing laws about voter ID or other restrictions, voting rights has emerged as a hot topic and could play a role in 2014 races, including the battle for governor in Florida.\nTo dispute Obama\u2019s number of more than 100 cases, the Heritage Foundation pointed to a DOJ list of voting section litigation cases that included 41 cases filed since 2009. The cases pertain to discrimination, absentee voting overseas and other matters. (We don\u2019t find the difference between 39 and 41 significant -- von Spakovsky said that the case involving the New Black Panther Party was filed in early January, before Obama was inaugurated, so that\u2019s one he didn\u2019t count.)\nThe reason why that DOJ website page shows a much smaller number than the one Obama cited is that the online list represents only cases filed by the Justice Department -- not cases in which the department was a defendant or filed an amicus.\nJustice spokeswoman Dena Iverson sent PolitiFact a list of voting rights cases in which the voting section of the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice began its participation after January 21, 2009. That list contains 102 cases.\n\"The list includes all voting rights cases whether the department participated in the case as a plaintiff, a defendant, amicus or otherwise,\" Iverson said.\nThe list includes cases that have concluded and are pending, as well as cases that are moot due to the Shelby County v. Holder ruling, she said. It does not include cases if they were strictly federal appellate cases or out-of-court settlements reached in 2010 and 2012 under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act.\nSo the \"more than 100 cases\" referenced by Obama refers to a broader list than the one on DOJ\u2019s website cited by Heritage.\nThe list of 102 cases includes about a half-dozen cases involving the state of Florida, including a few in which the state of Florida was the plaintiff. One of the most notable cases is the Justice Department complaint against the state or conducting a purge of its voter registration rolls within 90 days of an election. (A federal appeals court ruled April 1 that Florida violated the law, but by then Secretary of State Ken Detzner had announced he had canceled the next round of the non-citizen purge.)\n\n"}

So it may have come as a surprise to hear him give a shout-out on ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour on Aug. 29, 2010, to the fast-food giant McDonald's -- or at least the restaurants in his homeland, England.\n\nOliver, AKA the Naked Chef, is perhaps best known to American audiences for his Emmy-winning reality program Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution on ABC, in which he tried to transform the eating habits of the residents of Huntington, W.Va., statistically one of the unhealthiest cities in the country.\n\nOn ABC's This Week, Oliver said the food revolution is about giving people the tools to make good, nutritious choices.\n\nBut host Christiane Amanpour asked Oliver to respond to a comment David Letterman made to him when he appeared on the Late Show: \"Try as hard as you might, you're never going to succeed, because we are living in a culture dominated by the commerce of selling food which is inherently unhealthy,\" Letterman said.\n\nSaid Oliver: \"In the one way, he's right. You know, the structure of commerce and food in America is so intertwined in broadcast, print media, advertising, TV. I think that the problem we have to have -- and it's an interesting one. I'll throw it back at you. Like fast food I've hated for many years. And the last two years, I like stopped. And I actually now start to see (fast food chains) ironically as part of the solution.\n\n\"Now, I'll give you -- I'll give you one brand, like McDonald's. McDonald's, in England, has had its best three years ever, profitability. It only sells organic milk, free range eggs. You know, it's got an incredible standard of beef. And their ethics is really ... moving. But that's nothing like the one in the States. And the only distinguishing part is the public and what they expect.\"\n\nPart of the allure of McDonald's is its uniformity, that a Big Mac in New York will be the same as one in London. And so we wondered if Oliver was right that McDonald's restaurants in England really \"only sell organic milk\" and \"free range eggs,\" and that, by implication, they are dramatically different and more healthy than McDonald's restaurants in the United States.\n\nWe made queries with McDonald's officials in the U.S. and Britain, and neither responded, but we were able to piece together the pertinent facts from company web pages and documents.\n\nLet's break this into two parts.\n\nFirst, do McDonald's restaurants in England \"only sell\" organic milk?\n\nAccording to the McDonald's UK website, all of the bottled milk offered for sale in UK McDonald's (most of it sold along with kids' meals) is \"semi-skimmed organic.\" In 2007, McDonald's UK made an even bigger commitment to organic milk, announcing that all the milk served with the teas and coffees it sells in 1,200 outlets in the UK will come from organic British cows. The company said organic farmers who supply McDonald's \"don't use (genetically modified) feed or artificial pesticides in fields where their cows graze.\" Media reports suggested McDonald's alone could account for 5 percent of the UK\u2019s organic milk supplies.\n\nOrganic milk is not, however, used in milkshakes in the British stores.\n\nAccording to the website, \"Organic milk is still a relatively small industry in the UK and McDonald's simply can't find a supplier that can meet the high volume demands. The company is in talks with the dairy industry about how it can facilitate more farmers switching to organic but, until the organic food supply chain can guarantee that it can supply the required amount, McFlurries, Sundaes and Milkshakes will continue to be made from non-organic milk from the British Isles.\"\n\n(In the U.S., McDonald's does not use organic milk.)\n\nSecond, do McDonald's restaurants in England only use free-range eggs (meaning, eggs that come from hens that are not in cages and are free to roam outside)?\n\n"}

So why do supporters think things are different now?\n\"One of the objections to the bills I had was, obviously, cost,\" Rep. Duane Hall, a Raleigh Democrat, told the N.C.

Could Grayson be right that the United States is one of the only countries in the entire world that doesn\u2019t grant a legal right to paid time off?\nWell, not exactly; Grayson\u2019s campaign admitted he had misspoken. But available research shows he\u2019s not far off the mark by suggesting that America is unique by not guaranteeing vacation time.\nZero guarantee\nGrayson campaign spokesman David Damron told us via email that the Orlando Democrat meant to say only a handful of island nations in the Pacific Ocean joined the United States in not guaranteeing paid time off \u2014 not two countries in Africa. Those five countries, according to Wikipedia, were Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Palau and Nauru, he said.\n\"The congressman accidentally conflated guaranteed paid vacation and paid sick time in his recollection of which countries fell into this category of weak worker protections with the United States, which was the basis for his reference to Africa (rather than the Pacific),\" Damron wrote.\nWe don\u2019t take Wikipedia\u2019s word as gospel, of course, but we could not get experts to speak to specific conditions in those five countries. Together, they have a population of around 300,000 \u2014 or about the population of Pittsburgh.\nThe biggest repository of trusted data we found came from UCLA\u2019s World Policy Analysis Center. Their database showed 13 countries, including the United States, with no guaranteed paid annual leave.\nTheir list did include Kiribati, the Marshall Islands and Nauru, but also larger countries like Pakistan and India. Now, sometimes leave varies by how long a worker is at a job or some other classification. The World Policy Analysis Center\u2019s database notes they \"report the lowest amount of leave guaranteed to a worker with at least one year of tenure.\"\nThe World Bank has its own detailed numbers for vacation available to workers based on tenure. The bank measured paid annual leave for 189 economies, including splitting some countries into large metro areas. The United States, for example, is split into New York and Los Angeles.\n\n"}

On July 29, when Tapper made his claim, the UN reported 229 child deaths.\nSo Tapper\u2019s estimate that \"more than 200\" Palestinian children are dead is accurate.\nWhether you can attribute all the deaths directly to Israel, however,\u00a0is more of an open debate. Palestinian and Israeli officials have blamed each other\u2019s bombs for some of the civilian deaths -- for example, the 15 Palestinians killed at a UN school in Jabalia on July 24. When Tapper went on air, the UN had not yet been able to definitively resolve their conflicting claims, although they\u2019ve since traced the mortal shell to Israel.\nOther children have died during gunfights between the Israel Defense Force (IDF) and Hamas, and it\u2019s impossible to say definitively whose bullets killed them.\nIsraeli military deaths\nTracing deaths in the IDF back eight years takes a little more work.

Marco Rubio called the release of the document \"reckless and irresponsible.\" Rubio raised concerns that the release could endanger lives of Americans overseas, incite violence and create problems for our allies.\n\"The one-sided report that will be released by Democrats on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence cost U.S. taxpayers over $40 million dollars to produce, and its authors never interviewed a single CIA official,\" Rubio wrote in a statement with Sen. Jim. Risch, R-Idaho, on Dec. 8.\nThe report garnered widespread media coverage upon its release. But did the authors really fail to interview a single CIA official? We took a closer look.\nCIA torture report drew from inspector general interviews\nOn Dec. 9, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released a report about the CIA\u2019s interrogation techniques in the wake of 9/11 that had been years in the making. About 500 pages of the 6,700 page report were made public.\nThe report concluded that the techniques were not an effective way to gain intelligence from detainees, and that the CIA misled Congress and the White House. The report detailed such techniques as \"rectal rehydration\" and the use of coffin-size confinement boxes.\nRubio has a point that the committee did not conduct face-to-face interviews with CIA employees and contractors.\nHere\u2019s how the report addresses that point: \"CIA employees and contractors who would otherwise have been interviewed by the committee staff were under potential legal jeopardy, and therefore the CIA would not compel its workforce to appear before the committee.\"\nBut there are two wrinkles.\nFirst, then-CIA Director Michael Hayden -- whose tenure started in 2006 years after the interrogation techniques under scrutiny started -- testified in a closed-door session before the committee in 2007, though the committee deemed the testimony less than entirely helpful. A 38-page appendix in the report -- \"Example of Inaccurate CIA Testimony to the Committee April 12, 2007\" -- shows how Hayden\u2019s testimony conflicted with CIA records on multiple points including the number of detainees, the information gleaned from them and interrogation tactics used.\nFor example, Hayden suggested that the CIA interrogation program was successful in obtaining intelligence from all detainees. But the report counters, \"CIA records reveal that 34 percent of the 119 known CIA detainees produced no intelligence reports.\"\nThe second problem with Rubio\u2019s claim is that the report did draw from existing interviews of CIA officials, not to mention \"more than six million pages of CIA materials,\" including \"operational cables, intelligence reports, internal memoranda and emails, briefing materials\" and other records.\nSpecifically, the committee had access to interviews of CIA officials that had been conducted by the CIA's inspector general, as well as the CIA\u2019s oral history program.\nA background document provided by U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, the committee\u2019s chair, stated, \"These documents included summaries of more than 100 CIA inspector general interviews with extensive quotations, as well as CIA cables, emails, letters, briefing notes, intelligence products, classified testimony, and other records. Of particular value were the interview summaries, which included responses to many of the questions the committee would have asked had the committee been able to conduct its own interviews.\"\nThe interview reports and transcripts included former CIA director George Tenet; Jose Rodriguez, director of the CIA\u2019s counterterrorism center, CIA General Counsel Scott Muller; CIA Deputy Director of Operations James Pavitt; CIA Acting General Counsel John Rizzo; CIA Deputy Director John McLaughlin; and a variety of interrogators, lawyers, medical personnel, senior counterterrorism analysts and managers of the detention and interrogation program, according to Feinstein.\nRubio spokeswoman Brooke Sammon said the senator didn\u2019t count Hayden\u2019s interview because it pre-dated the 2009 start of work on the report. \"Any appearance before that was simply the CIA director appearing before the oversight committee,\" told PolitiFact.\nAs for the transcripts of prior interviews, Sammon echoed a point in the Republicans\u2019 minority report that argues that transcripts of interviews done by the inspector general aren\u2019t the same as if the committee had done their own, fresh interviews.\n\n"}

Charlie Crist as a repeat flip-flopper who vetoed a project out of political spite. In one of Rubio's most recent claims, posted to his campaign website\u00a0June 2, 2010,\u00a0he says that Crist \"bizarrely vetoed\" $9.7 million for a teaching hospital at the University of Florida \"despite having previously argued the budget request had merit.\"Here is what Rubio wrote:\"For his latest astounding flip-flop, Charlie Crist on Friday vetoed nearly $9.7 million in state funding for a teaching hospital at the University of Florida despite having included the funding as part of his budget recommendation in January. As part of his proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2010-2011, Charlie Crist\u2019s office even wrote a justification for the budget request that can be read HERE. Yet, Crist bizarrely vetoed the funding despite having previously argued that the budget request had merit. Was this political payback for Republican leaders no longer supporting him? Is there anything else that could explain a seemingly inexplicable flip-flop?\"There is no dispute that Crist vetoed $9,673,569 for Shands teaching hospital -- line item 185. The veto on May 28 was one of about $371 million in budget vetoes. So the only question is if he had \"previously argued the budget request had merit.\"Some background: Shands at UF is a teaching hospital in Gainesville that serves many uninsured patients and draws patients from throughout the state. In the last fiscal year, Shands UF provided about $49 million in unreimbursed financial assistance. But Crist's veto could cost the hospital at least $12 million in matching federal funds, according to a June 2 article in the Gainesville Sun.Now, some political context leading up to Crist's veto. Crist included $9,673,569 for Shands in his recommended budget that was released in January. When he proposed his budget, Crist -- a Republican at the time -- was in a battle for the Republican Senate primary with former House Speaker Rubio. During the spring legislative session, his relationship with some Republicans soured over disagreements about abortion, teacher tenure and other issues. He found himself lagging behind Rubio in the polls and announced April 29 that he would ditch the GOP and run as an independent. So that means Crist was an independent by veto day.Rubio provides links to Crist's budget request for the hospital funding. It includes the appropriation bill showing the money for Shands hospital.Shands officials were surprised by the veto.\"We had no idea this was coming,\" Shands spokeswoman Kim Rose said in a June 3 interview. \"We had not been asked any questions about it. This appropriation was included in his last three budgets and he had recommended it for this one.\"A May 29 press release from Shands stated: \"This line item in the governor\u2019s budget has been in place for three decades and historically has been funded through a recurring general revenue allocation. As one of the state\u2019s largest charity care providers, these state funds were the only source available for Shands at UF to be eligible for additional federal funds since it is not part of a local taxing district.\"A May 30 article in the Gainesville Sun, one day after Crist's veto, quoted from a memo written by Shands HealthCare CEO Tim Goldfarb.\"Goldfarb said in the memo that the veto was unexpected because Crist had recommended the funding as part of the budget and approved it in his previous three proposed budget plans,'' stated the article. \"Goldfarb added the total impact could be even greater because the state cut could lead to a reduction in federal money.\" The Florida Times-Union had a direct link to Goldfarb's memo.Crist spokesman Sterling Ivey told Health News Florida and the Gainesville Sun that the governor vetoed the money because it was targeted at a single hospital and no other hospitals received the same type of additional funding. Crist wrote in his May 28 veto message that his budget would protect the most vulnerable -- though he vetoed money for Shands, a hospital that serves many poor patients.\"While economic recovery is on the horizon, General Revenue dollars are still scarce and spending has to be carefully prioritized to provide the most critical services to the citizens of our state,\" Crist wrote.\nThe governor defended his veto, according to a Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times June 4 article: \u201cThe concern was more with the process of it, to be honest with you. And the lateness of it. I didn\u2019t want things that came late and didn\u2019t have the complete committee vetting opportunity.\u201d\nCrist denied that his veto was political: \u201cIt\u2019s motivated by being an appropriate process (and) the economic reality that we\u2019re living in.\u201dMichelle Todd, a spokesperson for Crist's campaign, replied to PolitiFact Florida in an e-mail:\n\n"}

On page 29 of the paper, Hasan is listed as a participant; he was one of more than 300 officials, reporters and Capitol Hill aides who signed up for the conference.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn a statement, the think tank confirmed that the Hasan listed as a participant is the same Hasan accused of the Fort Hood shootings. But the statement also makes an important point: Hasan registered for the event on his own. He was not invited, and he attended only as an audience member in his capacity as a psychiatry fellow at the Uniformed Services University School of Medicine.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"All of these events were open to the public,\" the statement reads. \"At no time has Nidal Hasan been affiliated with [the Homeland Security Policy Institute] or The George Washington University.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo, Hasan chose to attend a conference relevant to his field, much like a doctor would attend a conference about diabetes, for example.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut here's the more important point: The task force has nothing to do with the White House, according to Sharon Cardash, associate director of the Homeland Security Policy Institute.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"HSPI's Presidential Transition Task Force is not and was not affiliated at all with the White House,\" she wrote us in an e-mail. \"The Task Force was created prior to the election; and was not formed at the request of any administration.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nIndeed, HSPI established the transition task force in April 2008, before Obama was in office, let alone the Democratic presidential nominee. In a city where policy papers are published nearly every day, the work done by the group no more advised the Obama administration than any of the other papers that came out before or after GWU's.\n\n\u00a0\n\nCorsi actually makes this point farther down in his story, which contradicts his headline: \"While the GWU task force participants included several members of government, including representatives of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, there is no indication in the document that the group played any formal role in the official Obama transition, other than to serve in a university-based advisory capacity.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd in an editor's note to the story, Corsi writes that, \"Hasan is being reported as a participant in the GWU Homeland Security Policy Institute's Presidential Transition Task Force, not as a member, noting the group was a university think-tank, not part of the Obama administration official transition team.\" But it appears that disclaimer came later, and that it failed to stop the avalanche of e-mails spreading the inaccurate report.\n\n\nHasan attended a meeting on a subject relevant to his profession, that much is clear. But beyond that, there's nothing to back up the chain e-mail's accusation that he somehow was \"an ADVISOR\" to the Obama administration or that GWU's task force was involved in the new White House. In fact, the group's work began long before Obama took office and is in no way affiliated with the White House. Another chain e-mail, another Pants on Fire!\n\n\n"}

In a talk with natural gas advocates in Harrisburg, Wagner said climate change is probably happening, but the government should nevertheless pare down restrictive regulations on the natural gas drilling industry.\n\"I haven\u2019t been in a science class in a long time, but the earth moves closer to the sun every year -- you know the rotation of the earth,\" Wagner said, according to State Impact, an NPR affiliate. \"We\u2019re moving closer to the sun.\"\nHe added, \"We have more people. You know, humans have warm bodies. So is heat coming off? Things are changing, but I think we are, as a society, doing the best we can.\"\nThe Pennsylvania Democratic party publicly chastised Wagner for the suggestion and the senator was slammed in comments sections for the statement. So we decided to check his claim: Is the Earth really moving closer to the sun? And has body heat contributed to global climate change?\nLet\u2019s start with the, er, \"manmade\" option first: Despite Wagner\u2019s question, there is no evidence to suggest human body heat is causing global climate change. As PolitiFact has pointed out time and time again, the overwhelming majority of experts agree that climate change is happening and humans are causing it largely through producing carbon dioxide that exacerbates the Earth\u2019s greenhouse effect.\nDave Goldberg, an associate department head for undergraduate studies and a professor in Drexel University\u2019s Department of Physics, said the idea that human body heat is changing the temperature is \"absurd.\" He said the regular energy collected from the sun is about a million times larger than the energy humans emit through body heat, so Wagner was \"off by literally a factor of a million.\"\nWagner did say with more confidence though that the Earth \"moves closer to the sun every year,\" but that claim -- and the way he used it -- also has little root in scientific evidence.\nDonald Schneider, a distinguished professor and head of Penn State\u2019s Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, said \"on average, we aren\u2019t changing our distance and the Earth is not spiraling into the sun continuously.\"\nTechnically, the Earth does move closer to the sun every year -- and then it moves back, in that same year. That\u2019s because the Earth doesn\u2019t orbit around the sun in a circular motion. Instead, Schneider explained, it maintains an elliptical orbit, so for half the year, the Earth is moving toward the sun and for the other half it\u2019s moving away. Then the process, which Schneider said wouldn\u2019t have an impact on climate change \"on human time scales,\" repeats every year.\n\n"}

Bobby Scott, D-Va., is flipping the script and saying that all congressional Republicans voted to defund police this year when they opposed a $1.9 trillion stimulus plan.\n\"Every Republican in Congress voted to defund police when they voted against the American Rescue Plan,\" Scott tweeted on July 12.\u00a0\nScott represents Virginia\u2019s 3rd congressional district, stretching from Norfolk and parts of Chesapeake north through Newport News and west through Franklin.\u00a0\nHis claim, echoing a Democratic talking point, melts under scrutiny. Here\u2019s why.\nThe Facts\nThe term \"defunding police'' arose after the 2020 killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Many advocates say it does not mean abolishing police, but rather reallocating some of the money and the duties that have traditionally been handled by police departments.\nFor example, instead of dispatching police for routine calls involving drug abuse or mental health issues, advocates say it would be better to send officials from social service departments who have training in treating people with those problems. Some of the funds going to police, they say, would be better spent treating mental illness and addiction. Theoretically, that would allow police to put more focus on violent crime.\nThe defund police movement became an attack line for Republicans in 2020, and many Democrats, including President Joe Biden, repeatedly disassociated themselves from it. Moderate Democrats, including Sen. Mark Warner and Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, said progressives\u2019 calls for defunding police were a large reason congressional Democrats didn\u2019t win as many seats as expected last fall.\nThe American Rescue Plan passed Congress in March 2021 with no Republican support. The $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package provides aid to individuals, small businesses, nonprofits and the tourism industry. Included in that amount is $350 billion to help state, local and tribal governments recoup revenues they lost because of the coronavirus crisis. The law gives governments choices for using the money, including providing \"premium pay to essential workers or provid(ing) grants to employers of essential workers during the COVID-19 emergency.\"\nIn other words, the law does not require governments to spend the aid on essential workers such as police, teachers or medical technicians; it gives them the option to. When lawmakers voted on the bill, there was no guarantee that localities would funnel some of the money to police departments. And the bill did not cut funding to any department. So a vote against the bill giving the states and localities a one-time injection of extra cash was not tantamount to a vote to defund police.\nRepublican leaders never mentioned police funding in their list of reasons for voting against the bill. They criticized the cost of the package, charged that it was filled with Democratic pet projects, and said only a small portion of the money was specifically designated for spending on the coronavirus vaccines.\n\n"}

It does.\"\nWe reached out to Simmons and did not hear back, but Hitler\u2019s gun policies are a familiar talking point among opponents of gun control, and one that we explored during the 2016 presidential campaign.\nSimmons\u2019 statement misses several historical facts.\nHitler was both a giver and a taker\nBy the time Hitler took power in 1933, Germany had been operating under the 1928 Law on Firearms and Ammunition. The measure relaxed strict controls imposed after World War I that banned all gun ownership, and created a system to register and sell firearms.\nColumbia University law professor Bernard Harcourt translated a couple of key provisions in the law that exempted \"officials of the central government, the states, as well as the German Railways Company\" and \"community officials to whom the highest government authority has permitted acquisition without an acquisition permit.\"\nDagmar Ellerbrock, an expert on German gun policies at the Dresden Technical University, told us in 2015 that the Nazis introduced a collective gun license for members of Nazi organizations. One of the main beneficiaries was the paramilitary Sturmabteilung, or brownshirts.\nAfter the German parliament, the Reichstag, granted Hitler emergency powers in March 1933, he had a free hand.\n\"Under totalitarian rule, it took just a few weeks to drastically increase the number of Germans who held private weapons,\" Ellerbock said.\n\nAn armed member of the Sturmabteilung guards Communists arrested in Berlin following a key parliamentary Nazi victory March 5, 1933. (German Federal Archives via Wikicommons)\nAt the same time, the German state confiscated weapons from Jews, Communists, Social Democrats and unions that refused to affiliate with the Nazi Party. Did the 1928 registration law make this easier?\nPerhaps, but Ellerbock\u2019s research showed many holes in the system. For the most part, it recorded only new sales, while many people had unregistered weapons dating from World War I.\nWhen they came to power, the Nazis used whatever gun records they had to seize weapons from their enemies, but Ellerbock told us the files included very few of the firearms in circulation.\n\"In my records, I found many Jews who well into the late 1930s possessed guns,\" Ellerbock told us.\nSo registration was spotty, confiscation was selective and Nazi allies found it easier, not harder to get weapons.\n\n"}

Did 25 percent of schools get a subpar -- below average -- score that indicates they are \"failing\" their students, as Vos claimed?\n\n\nThe report cards, first produced in October 2012, were the product of a bipartisan task force. Three Republicans -- Walker and the two top legislative leaders -- plus State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers co-chaired a group that included teachers, school leaders, researchers, advocates, and legislators from both parties.\n\n\nThe group voted against an A to F scale for the report cards and left the design of the rating scale to the Department of Public Instruction. Walker had advocated an A to F scale in the 2010 campaign, but nonetheless applauded the compromise package of accountability measures.\n\n\nUnder the system, schools were evaluated on test scores and test-taking participation, graduation rates, attendance and graduation rates and closing performance gaps between various student groups. About 210 schools were not rated mainly because information was lacking or the schools were too new or small.\n\n\nHere is the scale, and how 1,908 public schools came out :\n\n\nSignificantly Exceeds Expectations: 66 schools (3.5 percent). Based on combined score of 83 -100.\n\nExceeds Expectations: 643 schools (33.7 percent). Scores of 73 - 82.9.\n\nMeets Expectations: 926 schools (48.5 percent). Scores of 63 - 72.9.\n\nMeets Few Expectations: 197 schools (10.3 percent). Scores of 53 - 62.9.\n\nFails to Meet Expectations: 76 schools (4.0 percent). Scores of 0 - 52.9.\n\n\nAn Oct. 22, 2012, Associated Press story on the cards described the results this way: \"Most Wisconsin schools meet or exceed expectations as defined on new, more stringent report cards ... More than 85 percent of schools meet or exceed expectations.\"\n\n\nThe Journal Sentinel said that of schools rated, 86 percent met or exceeded the state's expectations for performance, noting: \"About 14% of the schools rated...fell below the state's expectations for performance.\"\n\n\nSo the report card says one in 10 schools are meeting \"few\" expectations, and one in 25 are simply failing to meet expectations -- for a combined total of 14 percent or one in seven below the \"meets expectations\" level.\n\n\nWith that statistical backdrop, how does Vos come up with 25 percent (his one in four) that are \"subpar\" and \"failing\" in their mission?\n\n"}

Bruce Rauner vetoed the state's first attempt at automatic voter registration (AVR) over questions about fraud and federal compliance.\nBut the chief co-sponsor of the new legislation, state Rep. Mike Fortner, R-West Chicago, wrote in an op-ed that his bill \"requires the applicant to attest to their eligibility to vote, as is required by the National Voter Registration Act and used by all other states that have (automatic voter registration).\"\nWith automatic voter registration gaining momentum in recent years, we decided to look into Fortner\u2019s claim to see whether states that have authorized AVR do in fact require applicants to attest to their eligibility to vote.\nAutomatic voter registration in the U.S. \nIllinois\u2019 attempt to institute automatic voter registration failed after Rauner vetoed Senate Bill 250 over concerns it could violate federal election law and open the door to voter fraud.\nRauner said he supports modernizing the state\u2019s election system and easing voter access, and noted in his veto message that with a few changes, he could get behind a future version of the bill. \u00a0\nThat new version was introduced Nov. 15 by House Republican leader Jim Durkin in the form of House Bill 6627. Later that month, Fortner penned an op-ed explaining how the GOP-backed legislation addresses the issues raised by the governor.\nSix states -- Alaska, California, Connecticut, Oregon, Vermont and West Virginia -- and the District of Columbia have enacted AVR as of Dec. 8, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nIn March 2015, Oregon became the first state in the nation to pass a law that allows for the automatic registration of eligible residents applying for or renewing a driver\u2019s license, except those who opt out.\nMost recently, voters in Alaska approved a November ballot measure to allow AVR through the state\u2019s Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD), which pays a sum to eligible residents who have lived in Alaska for a full calendar year.

There is one exception: the Libertarian Party. Over the same time frame, voter registration in the Libertarian Party rose 8 percent.\u201d Did the major parties bleed voters while the LPT surged? Significantly, party affiliations based on voter registration records can only be gauged in the 29 states that allow citizens to declare an affiliation when they register. Texas is among 21 states that don\u2019t permit voters to air a preference at registration time. To \u00a0back up its claim, the Texas party\u2019s release cites a blog post on smallgovtimes.com. We found that post largely based on research by Michael McDonald, an associate professor of Public and International Affairs at George Mason University. McDonald cites his research in two May posts at Pollster.com. In his first post, McDonald writes that since the 2008 election, voters registering as Democrats are down by 2.7 percent and voters registering as Republicans have dropped 3.5 percent in those states where voters are allowed to register an affiliation. Voters registering their affiliation with a minor party increased by 2.4 percent, he writes. Still, McDonald does not see an incipient minor-party revolution afoot. \u201cAmerica is a long way from having a viable multi-party system at the federal level, like we are currently witnessing in the United Kingdom,\u201d he says in his second post. \u201cHowever, these trends are consistent with the notion that some American voters are willing to express their frustration with the major parties by registering with a minor political party or affiliating with no party. Indeed, the increase in unaffiliated registrations is a long-term phenomenon observed since the 1970s.\u201d We contacted McDonald in hopes of boring in on Libertarian voter registrations. He told us he did not separately calculate registration for minor parties, but referred us to Richard Winger, a Libertarian himself and the editor of Ballot Access News, a monthly newsletter. A May 26 blog post by Winger says Libertarian registrations in places that allow registration by party are up 8 percent since October 2008 \u2014 the figure cited in the release from the Texas Libertarians. Generally, Winger writes, more \u201cvoters are registered Libertarians now than ever before. Between October 2008 and this spring, Libertarian registration rose in 19 of the 23 states that tally Libertarians. It declined in four states, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, and South Dakota,\u201d a state where the party has not been on the ballot since 2006.Professor McDonald told us he still doesn\u2019t see Libertarians succeeding at the polls unless, he said, they move en masse to, say, lightly populated Wyoming. \u201cThey\u2019re not concentrated enough in one state or district in order to win elections,\u201d he said.Here\u2019s why: Regardless of cited changes in party affiliation percentage-wise, the raw numbers of voters registering affiliations underscore the dominance of the major parties. As researched by McDonald, some 43.3 million voters now line up as Democrats, while 29.9 million align as Republicans. Meanwhile, 2.2 million voters are registered as members of minor parties. As of May, according to Winger\u2019s research, more than 259,000 voters had registered affiliations with the Libertarian Party.Even if we assume that some of nearly 23.6 million unaffiliated voters in states where voters can register their affiliations end up supporting Libertarians at the polls, their numerical share of the electorate is swamped by either of the major parties.In elections, numbers are everything. That brings us to a statistical problem with the Libertarian\u2019s statement: it compares a reduction in numbers (how many voters fell off the Democratic and Republican rolls) with an increase in a percentage (the share of voters affiliated with the Libertarian party).Patrick Dixon of Lago Vista, chairman of the Libertarian Party of Texas, told us that\u2019s how the information was presented on the cited online sources. \u201cMaybe I was a little lazy there,\u201d Dixon said. Regardless, he said, the trend is that \u201cour party is growing and theirs are shrinking or growing flat.\u201dIn fact, McDonald\u2019s breakdown, shown on a chart in his first May blog post, tracks registrations both by raw numbers and percentages for the two major parties and all minor parties lumped together.Upshot: Based on voter registrations in 29 states that allow voters to declare their party affiliation, the statistics cited by the Libertarian Party are correct.But comparing raw numbers and percentages to make a point, as the Libertarians do, can leave a distorted impression: that the major parties are fading away as the Libertarians gallop ahead.

The law \"will cut $500 billion from Medicare\" and \"hurt the quality\" of care for seniors.\n\nPolitiFact National found the law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget, but reduces the growth of Medicare spending by just over $500 billion over 10 years.\n\nIn rating the claim Mostly False, our colleagues noted that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will rise to $929 billion in 2020, an increase of $430 million over actual spending in 2009.\n\nSo, Medicare spending continues to increase, but not by as much as it would have without the reform law.\n\nThe claims of a $500 billion cut to Medicare, however, have continued.\n\nIn May 2012, a Republican Ohio congressman accused a Democratic Ohio congresswoman of having \"gutted Medicare by $500 billion\" by voting for the health care reform law. PolitiFact Ohio rated the claim Mostly False, noting that Medicare spending would have grown at a faster rate without the law.\n\nThe same month, PolitiFact Florida gave a Mostly False to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for saying \"seniors will see $500 billion in Medicare cuts to fund \u2018Obamacare.\u2019\" Our colleagues found that slowing the growth in Medicare spending is intended to offset, to some extent, the overall cost of the law.\n\n(For a comprehensive look at Medicare and claims made about it, read \"The PolitiFact guide to Medicare attack lines.\")\n\nDuffy claim\n\nDuffy's made his claim in a news release issued June 7, 2012 to criticize Kreitlow's support of the health care reform law. Regarding the law's effect on Medicare, Duffy said:\n\n\"Kreitlow's full-throated support for the government\u2019s unwarranted takeover of healthcare slashed $500 billion from Medicare, too.\"\n\n(Claims that Obama's law is a government takeover of health care was PolitiFact National's Lie of the Year for 2010.)\n\nDuffy campaign manager Justin Richards argued that \"slashed\" is an accurate way of describing how the law reduces the growth in Medicare spending. But even though some of the news article excerpts Richards cited referred to cuts, he acknowledged that the reductions are in the growth of future spending.\n\nOur rating\n\nDuffy said the federal health care reform law \"slashed $500 billion from Medicare.\"\n\nThere is an element of truth in his statement because Medicare spending will grow by about $500 billion less than it would have without the law. But the law has not already reduced Medicare spending by $500 billion, as Duffy suggests"}

Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a vocal advocate of tighter gun laws, called out President Donald Trump\u2019s pick for the Supreme Court for the nominee\u2019s position on the Second Amendment.\n\"Brett Kavanaugh is a true Second Amendment radical,\" Murphy tweeted July 9. \"He believes assault weapon bans are unconstitutional, a position way out of the judicial mainstream, far to the right of even late Justice Scalia.\"\n\n\n\nWe wondered whether Kavanaugh, who will replace Justice Anthony M. Kennedy if confirmed, on the issue of assault weapons indeed stands to the right of Scalia, who as a young man would tote his rifle on the New York City subway.\nAfter reading the relevant court decisions, experts told us both Kavanaugh and Scalia hold that assault weapons are protected under the Second Amendment.\nAssault weapons encompass a series of semi-automatic firearms, mostly rifles. Semi-automatic weapons are those where one trigger pulled equals one bullet shot.\nThe Heller case\nOne of the defining cases on gun rights in recent years is D.C. vs. Heller. Alongside five others, Richard Heller, a special police officer for the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit in 2003 challenging the constitutionality of the Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975, which restricted D.C. residents from owning handguns. The suit eventually reached the Supreme Court, which ruled 5-4 in Heller\u2019s favor. The majority decision was written by Scalia.\nScalia argued that handguns have not traditionally been banned and are in common use. He also pointed out, however, that the right granted by the Second Amendment \"is not unlimited,\" and upholds \"laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\"\nThe question of assault weapons never came up.\nInstead, rifles came up in a later legal challenge between Heller and Washington, when Heller questioned the constitutionality of the district\u2019s Firearms Registration Amendment Act of 2008, created in response to the Supreme Court decision.\n\n"}

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Trent Franks \"It is true\u00a0that we know that ISIS is present in Ciudad Juarez (Mexico)\"", "evidence": "With the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria growing in the Middle East, nearly half of Americans think the country is less safe than it was before Sept. 11, 2001, according to a recent poll.\nSome Republicans have expressed concern that the southern border is so porous, members of the extremist group could slip into the United States from Mexico. And a few have said such a plot is already in the works -- but federal agencies don\u2019t agree.\nRep. Trent Franks, a Republican from Arizona, said his state faces an imminent threat in a recent phone conference with conservative nonprofit Staying True to America\u2019s National Destiny. BuzzFeed picked up Franks\u2019 comment, and it made its way around the Internet.\n\"It is true, that we know that ISIS is present in Ciudad Juarez or they were within the last few weeks,\" Franks said. \"So there\u2019s no question that they have designs on trying to come into Arizona. The comment that I\u2019ve made is that if unaccompanied minors can cross the border then certainly trained terrorists probably can, too. It is something that is real.\"\nSeveral other politicians have made similar claims, including Texas Gov.\u00a0Rick Perry, Rep. Lou Barletta, R-Pa., and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. And the claims are spreading around conservative online media, like the Daily Caller, Breitbart News and pundit Sean Hannity at Fox News.\nThis clashes with the federal government\u2019s assertion that there is currently no credible threat that ISIS is planning an attack on United States soil.\nWith Franks and so many others claiming that the threat is certain and looming, we decided to see whether or not their evidence is credible. Based on our talks with experts and statements from law enforcement officials, the possibility of ISIS attacking the U.S. by crossing the southern border seems unlikely. The certainty that Franks suggests about what we \"know\" is wrong.\nThe origins\nIn a statement to PolitiFact, Franks said he got the information from a report circulating around the Internet. Franks has since learned that Homeland Security believes the report was \"overstated,\" and his subsequent comments reflect that -- though he remains concerned about the possibility of terrorists crossing the border.\nThe report is from Judicial Watch, a conservative media website, and it claims that \"Islamic terrorist groups are operating in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juarez and planning to attack the United States with car bombs or other vehicle borne improvised explosive devices,\" citing several anonymous \"high-level federal law enforcement, intelligence and other sources.\"\nWe couldn\u2019t find any other media outlets that independently verified the story, and no federal officials would corroborate its claims, either.\nWithout knowing anything about Judicial Watch\u2019s sources -- such as rank or agency -- it\u2019s hard for us to assess the article\u2019s credibility. In an interview with PolitiFact, Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton would not go into any further detail.\nThe article says the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to their multiple requests.\nWe asked Homeland Security about the threat in Juarez, and they said, \"There is no credible intelligence to suggest that there is an active plot by (ISIS) to attempt to cross the southern border.\"\nThe topic came up a few times in recent congressional hearings, and administrators reiterated the lacking evidence of an imminent threat.\nIn a Sept. 10 hearing before the House Homeland Security Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee, Rep. Lou Barletta, R-Pa., said, \"We know that terrorist networks have been using our porous southern border and a broken immigration system to enter the United States.\"\nDHS Deputy Under Secretary for Analysis Jennifer Lasley responded.\n\"To date, we have not had credible reporting that either Hezbollah or any other terrorist group has been taking advantage of our borders to move individuals in and out,\" Lasley said. \"It's something we are always looking for, but to date, we have not seen credible evidence of that.\"\nLater in the same hearing, Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, D-Texas, discussed his conversations with DHS, when administrators told him that there has never been evidence of terrorists entering the United States via the southern border. He posed the same question to DHS administrators present at the hearing.\nIn response, John Wagner, acting assistant commissioner for Custom and Border Patrol\u2019s Office of Field Operations, said it is much more likely that ISIS and other Islamic extremists\u00a0would come to the United States by commercial plane. Wagner said the number of people suspected in terrorist activity caught on the southern border is in the tens, while those on commercial jets is in the thousands.\nBoth Rep. Franks and Fitton of Judicial Watch mentioned to us that the government has intercepted ISIS social media posts that indicated a potential attack carried out by crossing the border.\n\n"}

Carson has a point that Clinton privately told a few people the attacks were the work of terrorists. But he\u2019s not accurate when he says she told \"everybody else\" that it was a video. Her public remarks were much more measured than Carson suggests.\nWhat Clinton said about Benghazi\nWe\u2019ve based our fact-checking of the Benghazi attacks on news accounts, government press releases and congressional investigations, as well as information we\u2019ve received from the Carson and Clinton campaigns.\nAs we have noted before, there was initial confusion about the cause of the attack at the time it happened. One key question was whether Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice purposefully downplayed the idea that it was a terrorist attack when she spoke on five Sunday talk shows days after the incident, instead suggesting that it a spontaneous reaction to a movie that mocked Islam. That movie had drawn protests around the Middle East at about the same time that the Benghazi attack happened. \u00a0\nHere are Clinton\u2019s key comments:\nSept. 11, 2012: The attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound begins at 3:40 p.m. ET (9:40 p.m. in Benghazi); an attack on a CIA mission annex begins at 6 p.m. ET. Four Americans die in the attacks.\nSept. 11, 2012: During a phone call with Libyan President Mohamed Magariaf around 8 p.m. ET, Clinton said she understood Ansar al-Sharia, an al-Qaida-affiliated group, claimed responsibility for the attacks, according to notes from that conversation documented in a State Department email. However, Ansar al-Sharia soon retracted the claim.\nClinton issued a public statement at 10:08 p.m. that didn\u2019t indicate a cause for the attack but said, \"Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet. ...\"\nAt 11:12 p.m., Clinton sent an email to her daughter Chelsea saying: \"Two of our officers were killed in Benghazi by an al Queda-like (sic) group. The ambassador, whom I hand picked and a young communications officer on temporary duty w a wife and two young children. Very hard day and I fear more of the same.\"\nSept. 12, 2012: In a call with Egyptian Prime Minister Hesham Kandil, Clinton said, \"We know that the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film. It was a planned attack \u2014 not a protest. Based on the information we saw today we believe the group that claimed responsibility for this was affiliated with al-Qaeda.\"\n\n"}

That assertion is now more widely disputed. Read our May 2021 report for more on the origins of the virus that causes COVID-19. That dispute notwithstanding, the claim that COVID-19 was created with research funded by Dr. Anthony Fauci remains False.\nMore than a year after the coronavirus first arrived in the U.S., conspiracy theories continue to spread about a virology lab in Wuhan, China, which has drawn scrutiny throughout the pandemic for research it conducted on bat viruses.\u00a0\nOne new claim about the lab comes from conservative news site WorldNetDaily, which tried to connect Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of infectious diseases at the National Institutes of Health, to the origin of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.\u00a0\n\"New evidence ties COVID-19 creation to research funded by Fauci,\" reads the headline.\nDespite its promise of \"new evidence,\" the WorldNetDaily article largely resembled other conspiracy theories that we have fact-checked in the past. It was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nAs evidence of its claims, the article cited an investigation by Fox News commentator Steve Hilton, who claims that the coronavirus was created at the Wuhan lab with NIH grant money.\u00a0\nAlthough the NIH did fund a project at the Wuhan lab, there\u2019s no proof that the coronavirus was bioengineered. Both the WorldNetDaily article and Hilton\u2019s segment rely on a series of unsubstantiated allegations to spin a conspiracy theory about the virus being a lab creation.\nWorldNetDaily has since dialed back on many of its claims, issuing three separate corrections, all of which cite scientists pushing back on the notion that SARS-CoV-2 was manmade. It has also placed a question mark at the end of the original headline. However, the bulk of the article text has not been updated.\nThe NIH grant to EcoHealth Alliance\nIn 2014, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, the part of the NIH headed by Fauci, awarded a $3.4 million grant to the New York-based EcoHealth Alliance, which aims to protect people from viruses that jump from species to species. The alliance has projects across 30 countries, including Thailand, Vietnam and China.\u00a0\nThe group hired the virology lab in Wuhan to conduct genetic analyses of bat coronaviruses collected in Yunnan province, about 800 miles southwest of Wuhan. EcoHealth Alliance paid the lab $598,500 over five years. The lab had secured approval from both the U.S. State Department and the NIH.\u00a0\nThat the NIAID funded the project is not in question. However, the WorldNetDaily article goes further than that, claiming that the grant covered \"gain of function\" research on a bat coronavirus, which \"created\" SARS-CoV-2.\u00a0\nGain-of-function research is a controversial form of study that involves boosting the infectivity and lethality of a pathogen. Proponents of gain-of-function say it helps researchers spot potential threats to human health and allows them to figure out ways to tackle a new virus. Fauci has advocated for gain-of-function research in the past. In a 2011 article he co-wrote for the Washington Post, he promoted it as a means to study influenza viruses.\u00a0\nHowever, there\u2019s no hard proof to support the article\u2019s claims about gain-of-function research. The overwhelming consensus among public health experts is that the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 evolved naturally.\u00a0\nAll parties involved in the grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology have denied that it involved gain-of-function research.\u00a0\n\n"}

{"label": "false", "claim": "Jon Husted A member of the redistricting commission proposed in Issue 2 \"could accept a bribe from somebody\" and \"couldn\u2019t be removed from this commission.\"", "evidence": "Republican opponents of Issue 2, the proposed redistricting reform plan, have started to question the rules that would govern the new citizens committee that would handle redistricting should voters approve the measure on Nov. 6.\n\nSecretary of State Jon Husted underscored these concerns when he recently described to reporters a startling hypothetical situation involving a commission member.\n\n\"Apparently, you could accept a bribe from somebody to get the map that you want, and you couldn\u2019t be removed from this commission,\" Husted, a Republican and outspoken critic of Issue 2, told reporters after the Aug. 15 meeting of the Ohio Ballot Board to determine ballot language for Issue 2.\n\nIs Husted right? Issue 2, after all, is billed as an attempt to remove political influence from the redistricting process.\n\nPolitiFact Ohio checked into Husted\u2019s statement.\n\nFirst, some background about the current system and what Issue 2 would do if approved by voters on Nov. 6:\n\nIn Ohio now, elected officials control redistricting. Every 10 years, after the census, the governor, legislative leaders and others approve maps with new boundaries for Congressional and legislative districts. Historically, the process has been ultra-partisan, with the party in power drawing district lines that group voters in ways to ensure electoral success.\n\nIssue 2 would establish a 12-member commission of Democrats, Republicans and independents or third-party members to draw the lines. The commission would have to approve maps with districts that emphasize compactness, community preservation, competitiveness and that reflect how Ohioans have voted.\n\nThe proposal also includes criteria for serving on the commission. State and federal elected officials, their family members, lobbyists, well-heeled donors and others are banned. Proponents of Issue 2 have labeled the panel a \"citizens commission,\" but the proposal does not prohibit mayors or other local elected officials from serving.\n\nTo insulate the commission from political influence, the proposed constitutional amendment states that \"no member of the commission shall be subject to removal by the General Assembly or any member of the executive branch.\"\n\nSo, how would a commission member be removed for bribery?\n\nWe checked with Husted\u2019s office for evidence to support his claim. A spokesman directed us to view an online video of the ballot board meeting showing an exchange between Husted and Don McTigue, a lawyer for Voters First Ohio, the union-back group that supports Issue 2.\n\nHusted and McTigue debated how a commission member would be removed.\n\n\"You don\u2019t see any authority that is in this amendment that allows them (the commission) to remove somebody?\" Husted asked.\n\n\"Correct,\" McTigue answered.\n\nHusted spokesman Matt McClellan said it is clear that Issue 2 does not give the commission any power to remove a commission member engaged in questionable activity such as bribery. But that\u2019s not what Husted said. He said a commission member could not be removed at all.\n\nAnd McTigue later said there are other ways already in place to remove a commission member.\n\nOhio\u2019s bribery statute says that a public official convicted of bribery is \"forever disqualified from holding any public office, employment, or position of trust in this state.\"\n\nAn official convicted of bribery most likely would be removed from office by a judge during sentencing, McTigue said in an interview. But if not, Ohio law allows a county prosecutor to file a quo warranto action to remove an official unlawfully holding an office.\n\nWhen we presented to Husted\u2019s office the provisions of the bribery statute that would apply to a commission member convicted of bribery, his spokesman said Husted\u2019s point was that Issue 2 lacks a process to remove a commission member.\n\nAnother supporter of Issue 2 said there are other ways to handle a situation in which a commission member took a bribe.\n\nDaniel Tokaji, an Ohio State University law professor who helped draft Issue 2, however, said that existing Ohio law, enacted under Article 2, Section 38 of the Ohio Constitution, sets a process for removing an officeholder.\n\nThat section of the constitution says \"laws shall be passed providing for the prompt removal from office, upon complaint and hearing, of all officers, including state officers, judges and members of the general assembly, for any misconduct involving moral turpitude or for other cause provided by law; and this method of removal shall be in addition to impeachment or other method of removal authorized by the constitution.\"\n\nUnder that portion of the constitution, lawmakers enacted Ohio Revised Code sections 3.07 through 3.10, which lay out a judicial process for removal of officeholders in cases of \"gross neglect of duty, gross immorality, drunkenness, misfeasance, malfeasance or nonfeasance.\"\n\nTokaji said bribery would fall under gross immorality.\n\n\"A commissioner could therefore be removed for bribery following this statutory process,\" Tokaji said in an e-mail. \"Nothing in Issue 2 prevents this.\"\n\nBut the statutory process for removal presents an extremely high hurdle. The process would not begin until a complaint is filed with signatures totalling at least 15 percent of the votes cast in the most recent gubernatorial election. That means more than 577,000 registered voters would have to sign a complaint -- \u00a0about 192,000 more than were required to even put Issue 2 on the ballot.\n\nTokaji admitted that\u2019s a high threshold to meet, but said the legislature could amend the laws to ease the requirement to initiate the removal process.\n\nIssue 2 opponents argue that the existing Ohio law for removing officeholders would not apply to redistricting commission members. They point out that the proposed amendment prohibits the General Assembly and executive branch from removing a commission member.\n\nBut while the amendment states that lawmakers cannot remove commission members. It does not say that they have no authority to enact laws that govern how members can be removed.\n\nSo where does that leave us? Is Husted\u2019s claim, that a member who accepted a bribe could not be removed from the commission, plausible?\n\nNo.\n\nA bribery conviction would disqualify a commission member from serving. Further, a commission member could be subject to the judicial removal process in the Ohio Revised Code.\n\nHusted is correct about the language in the ballot issue -- there\u2019s nothing in the proposal that allows for the commission to remove one of its members engaged in questionable activity. But that\u2019s not what he said to reporters in his interview.\n\nAnd he went too far when he said a commission member could remain after accepting a bribe. Although there isn\u2019t a removal process within the proposed amendment, others exist in state law.\n\nHusted\u2019s statement is not accurate"}

Authorities said more than 200 people remained unaccounted for. The fire started on Nov. 8, 2018 in a wooded area near the town of Paradise.\nMeanwhile, in Southern California, the Woolsey fire in Ventura and Los Angeles counties was blamed for the death of two people and had destroyed an estimated 435\u00a0structures.

Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests.

He also approved California's request for a major disaster declaration, freeing up federal aid for fire response and recovery.\nGiven the strong reaction, we decided to fact-check the president\u2019s contention \"there is no reason\" for California\u2019s fires other than poor forest management.\nOur research\nTrump\u2019s claim suggests the state government controls decisions over how and whether to thin forests, clear brush and set prescribed burns. In reality, California owns just 2 percent of forest land in the state, while the federal government owns upwards of 60 percent, said Keith Gilless, a UC Berkeley professor of forest economics and chairman of the California Board of Forestry and Fire Protection. The rest is owned by private landowners, timber companies and Native American tribes.\nGilless said tree harvests have declined significantly on national forest lands over the past four decades due, at least in part, to legal challenges by environmentalists concerned about clear-cutting. The professor added that money spent in the past on preventing fires has been diverted to fighting them.\nThe state has made significant investments in forest management, he said, but \"has no leverage\" over the federal government to do the same. In August, McClatchy reported the Trump administration \"proposed slashing tens of millions of dollars\" for tree clearing.\nGilless added that Trump\u2019s tweet ignores additional key factors driving California\u2019s recent \"firestorms,\" such as winds reaching near 60 miles per hour and bone dry conditions.\n\n"}

{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Mike Haridopolos \"Obamacare cuts $500 billion in future Medicare funding in order to fund the new constitutionally questionable government mandate, even going so far as to scuttle Medicare's most popular (and successful) part, Medicare Advantage.\"", "evidence": "The federal health care law returned to the news June 8, 2011, when a trio of federal judges heard oral arguments over whether Congress can force people to either buy health insurance or pay penalties.\n\nWhich means for us ... more claims about the health care law.\n\nThis one comes from Florida Senate President Mike Haridopolos, a Republican running for Bill Nelson's seat in the U.S. Senate in 2012. Haridopolos published an op-ed in the Orlando Sentinel on June 9 titled \"More need protection under Medicare reform.\"\n\nHere are the first 200 words or so:\n\nLiberal politicians and media pundits in Washington have repeatedly sold us a false paradigm that we can either reform government spending, or we can protect the promise we've made to Americans in need, including seniors.\n\nWhat if I told you we could do both?\n\nEveryone should start from the position that no one will be helped if America falls into bankruptcy.\n\nThat's why I worked with Florida legislators during the 2011 session to pass a resolution rejecting Obamacare, countering the dangerous cuts this new government entitlement made to current programs, including Medicare, in order to fund new ones.\n\nIt's not a political ploy. It's a question of government making promises and breaking them at a time when millions of Americans are counting on them most.\n\nHere's what I mean: Obamacare funds welfare for able adults on the backs of seniors that have already paid their dues. Obamacare cuts $500 billion in future Medicare funding in order to fund the new constitutionally questionable government mandate, even going so far as to scuttle Medicare's most popular (and successful) part, Medicare Advantage.\n\nStrip aside the derisive references to Obamacare and you have an interesting two-part claim. One, that the federal health care law \"cuts $500 billion in future Medicare funding.\" And two, that it \"scuttle(s) Medicare's most popular (and successful) part, Medicare Advantage.\"\n\nPolitiFact has addressed the $500 billion in Medicare \"cuts\" several times, but since the topic keeps reappearing, we think it's time for a refresher course.\n\nBy way of introduction, Medicare serves as the health insurance program for 39 million seniors and another eight million people under 65 receiving Social Security. Medicare makes up 12 percent of the federal budget. Medicare reforms were part of the 2010 health care legislation.\n\nSome reforms increase Medicare spending to improve benefits and coverage, said Tricia Neuman, who is vice president and director of the Medicare Policy Project at the Kaiser Family Foundation -- a trusted independent source. For instance, the health care law adds $5 billion to help cover prevention services and $43 billion to help fill in a gap for enrollees purchasing prescription drugs through the Medicare Part D program (sometimes called the doughnut hole).\n\nOther provisions reduce the growth in Medicare spending to help the program operate more efficiently and help pay for coverage expansions to the uninsured in the underlying health reform legislation, Neuman said. And yet other provisions are designed to improve the delivery and quality of care. (Neuman explains the changes in an easily digestible tutorial on the Kaiser Family Foundation's website. It's the best non-ideological explanation we've seen.)\n\nThe key for us is noting that the law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget. Rather, the bill attempts to slow the program's future growth, curtailing just over $500 billion in future spending increases over the next 10 years.\n\nMedicare spending will still increase.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009. So while the health care law reduces the amount of future spending increases in Medicare, the law doesn't cut Medicare.\n\nHaridopolos' wording is better than similar claims we've seen. Again, he wrote that the health care law \"cuts $500 billion in future Medicare funding.\" It would have been better, though, had he added the word \"increased\" somewhere, and referred to Medicare spending rather than funding.\n\nThe spending reductions to\u00a0Medicare\u00a0are intended to offset, to some extent, the overall cost of the new health care law, which applies to everyone. So where does the $500 billion in savings come from?\n\nNearly $220 billion comes from reducing annual increases in payments that health care providers would otherwise receive from Medicare. Other savings include $36 billion from increases in premiums for higher-income beneficiaries and $12 billion from administrative changes. A new national board will be tasked to identify $15.5 billion in savings, but the board -- the Independent Payment Advisory Board -- is prohibited from proposing anything that would ration care or reduce or modify benefits.\n\nNone of those are cuts in the traditional sense. \n\n"}
{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Nathan Deal \"Illegal aliens are costing Georgia taxpayers over a billion dollars every year.\"", "evidence": "In a recent campaign commercial, candidate for governor Nathan Deal said he's concerned about \"you.\"\n\nAnd for your sake, he worries about illegal immigration.\n\nIn the ad, the former U.S. congressman walks along a lush meadow hemmed by a wooden fence, promising to get tough on illegal immigrants because they cost you far too much.\n\n\"Illegal aliens are costing Georgia taxpayers over a billion dollars every year,\" said Deal, who has long pushed for more restrictions on citizenship and aggressive enforcement of current immigration laws.\n\nMore than $1 billion? Is that possible?\n\nThe Deal campaign said the actual cost is even higher: $1.6 billion.\n\nThey cited a report by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that shares Deal's ideas on immigration.\n\nIn its October 2008 report, \"The Costs of Illegal Immigration to Georgians,\" FAIR estimated state and local costs related to the education, health care and incarceration of illegal immigrants.\n\nDeal actually understated FAIR's figure. The group put the total cost at more than $1.6 billion.\n\nWe decided to take a closer look. Illegal immigration is a complex subject, and its fiscal impacts can be especially murky. Researchers have tried to estimate costs for two decades, but it's hard because important data is not available.\n\nFew nonpartisan sources issue alternative fiscal estimates that focus on Georgia, in part because it's hard to get enough state-level data to do the subject justice.\n\nAnother problem is these studies are issued by groups with agendas, said Jeff Passel, senior demographer with the Pew Hispanic Center, which tries to \"improve understanding of the U.S. Hispanic population and to chronicle Latinos' growing impact on the nation.\" It does not take positions on policy issues.\n\n\"I can tell you what the result is based on who's doing the study,\" Passel said.\n\nThere is some consensus on the subject, according to a 2007 report by the Congressional Budget Office. The agency reviewed 29 studies on the issue and determined some areas where they agree.\n\nFor instance, if you lump legal and illegal immigrants together, they as a group bring in more in taxes than they use up over the long term, according to the CBO review. Also, the federal government doesn't give state and local governments enough to cover the cost of illegal immigration.\n\nFAIR's estimate of $1.6 billion was based on assumptions that are well outside such areas of consensus, PolitiFact Georgia found. And that's a problem.\n\nEducation was the biggest cost in FAIR's estimate, and one factor in their calculation is especially controversial to advocates on the opposite side of the ideological spectrum: FAIR included the cost of educating U.S.-born children whose parents came here illegally.\n\nFAIR argues that it's important to count them. Those kids wouldn't be here if their parents hadn't entered the country, and they would likely leave if their parents did.\n\nThat's correct, but it's reasonable to ask whether it's right to include the price of educating these children as part of the cost of \"illegal aliens,\" as Deal put it. The Constitution's 14th Amendment says any child born in the U.S. is a citizen.\n\nIf you exclude these kids, FAIR's estimate plummets by hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nAnother criticism concerns how the group adds up the price of educating a child of an illegal immigrant for a year. They said it is $8,450, based on figures from the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nThis cost is debatable. The price of adding a student or two, legal or otherwise, to an already-existing classroom might be much lower than FAIR's figure, experts said. That's because those students won't necessarily prompt a school district to hire an additional teacher or build a new school.\n\nIt also might be greater. For instance, a small town dealing with a major influx of children of illegal immigrants might have to build more schools and pay for other things they didn't need before, Passel said.\n\nThere are other reasonable criticisms of FAIR's approach.\n\nFAIR derived a portion of its health care costs from what may be a billion-dollar overestimate. The think tank RAND Corp. estimated that nationally, the government pays about $1.1 billion to give health care to illegal immigrants ages 18 to 64.\n\nFAIR assumed the actual cost is closer to $2 billion, nearly double the RAND figure. They reasoned that one of the study's authors publicly acknowledged health care costs could be twice as much. But in a PolitiFact Georgia e-mail exchange, that researcher wrote FAIR got what he said wrong, and the estimate shouldn't be doubled.\n\nIt's also worthwhile to note how FAIR counted the tax contributions of illegal immigrants.\n\nIt's standard practice for economists to give individuals credit for paying business taxes, said Matt Gardner, executive director for the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, which has progressive or liberal leanings. Every consumer routinely pays business taxes when they make purchases, because businesses boost their sales prices to cover them.\n\nFAIR did not include the business taxes paid by illegal immigrants, saying that including them \"posits that companies do not exist as economic entities,\" said Jack Martin, FAIR's special projects director.\n\nThese are only a few criticisms of FAIR's numbers. But taking even one of them into account can lower or raise the cost by $800 million or more.\n\nFor instance, FAIR calculated the net fiscal effect of illegal immigration on Georgia as $1.34 billion, taking into account $273 million they said the undocumented pay in taxes. But if you subtract the cost of educating the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants, the estimate plummets to about $550 million.\n\nAnd here's another example: Even FAIR thinks its 2008 figures are too low. A report issued last week increased their cost estimate to about $2.4 billion, based on new population figures and changes in how they incorporate criminal justice, health care and infrastructure costs.\n\nWhether you think FAIR's estimates are high or low, correct or erroneous, you run up against the same problem. A little more information or context and the estimate swings by a billion dollars, literally.\n\nThe variation is so wide and the assumptions are so contentious that it's misleading for Deal to flatly state that the cost of illegal immigration to taxpaying Georgians is more than $1 billion.\n\nIt is correct that Georgia foots the bill for illegal immigration. It could be substantial, depending on how you add it up. And while Deal's cost figure is rooted in data, there's an excellent chance that it's much higher than it should be.\n\nIt's not possible for PolitiFact Georgia to calculate a specific cost. Too little information exists on the subject for that calculation. Deal has a point, but his conclusion leaves out important details, which could lead to a different conclusion"}

Maybe not.\nTrue? PolitiFact decided to dig deeper.\nFirst, we\u2019ll provide some background.\nGeorgia started providing a tax credit for electric car purchases in 1998. Initially, businesses and individuals were offered a tax credit up to $1,500 as incentive to buy alternative-fuel vehicles. Two years later, the credit was upped to $2,500 for all low-emission vehicles, and in 2001, it was doubled to $5,000 for zero-emission vehicles. By comparison, Louisiana and Maryland offer a credit up to $3,000, and Utah gives up to $1,500. All three states limit the tax credit to vehicle purchases.\nGeorgia\u2019s $5,000 credit meant huge savings for state residents who wanted to buy or even lease an electric car -- especially when coupled with a federal tax credit that could be as much as $7,500, depending on the capacity of the vehicle\u2019s battery.\nThose who wanted to get rid of the tax credit said that the double tax credits were excessive and allowing Atlanta yuppies to lease electric cars, including the $30,000 Leaf, for as little as $100 a month.\nSupporters said the tax credit made Georgia one of the top states for electric cars, a positive step especially in metro Atlanta where air pollution from auto emissions has been a persistent problem.\nStatewide, electric car ownership has jumped dramatically just in the past couple of years..\nAccording to the state Revenue Department, 1,743 electric cars were riding the roads of Georgia in 2012. By 2014, that number had soared to 15,729, or an increase of 802 percent, with two-thirds of them parking outside homes in metro Atlanta\u2019s four biggest counties -- Fulton (4,288), Cobb (2,397), Gwinnett (2,087) and DeKalb (2,067).\nProposals to eliminate the tax credit went nowhere in 2013 and 2014. But in this year\u2019s legislative session, when raising $1 billion for transportation projects was a priority, budget analysts said cutting the tax credit for electric cars would bring in $66 million by 2016 and nearly $190 million by 2020.\nSupporters of the tax credit touted a private study that said, without the tax credit, Georgia\u2019s economy would lose $252 million in the next 16 years.\nWhat the numbers say\n\n"}

At one point, Clinton did call Obama\u2019s position on Iran diplomacy \"naive,\" but Sanders is leaving out important nuance that misrepresents her position at the time.\nFighting words\nThis all started at a July 2007 Democratic presidential debate, where CNN took questions from YouTube users.\nOne user asked, \"Would you be willing to meet separately, without precondition, during the first year of your administration, in Washington or anywhere else, with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea, in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries?\"\nObama was the first to respond, saying, \"I would. And the reason is this, that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them, which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of (the George W. Bush) administration, is ridiculous.\" (Obama made similar comments throughout the campaign.)\nClinton also answered the question, saying she agreed that she would approach adversaries differently than the Bush administration and \"get back to diplomacy.\" But she distinguished herself from Obama by saying she, as president, would not necessarily meet with these leaders in her first year, without any preconditions, which is what the YouTube question asked specifically. Instead, she would first send envoys.\n\n"}

The newspaper paraphrased Gray as saying Georgia is one of only seven states to lose jobs this year. The grand total of jobs lost? About 8,200, Gray said.\n\nMost economists define job creation as a net increase in the number of people employed between one time frame and another and job losses as a net decrease between two periods of time.\n\nIn January, about 3,806,600 Georgians were employed, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is the main source economists and others use to track employment data. In September, the most recent month available when Gray made his comments, the number of Georgians employed dropped to an estimated 3,798,400.\n\nThe difference: 8,200 jobs.\n\nThe September estimate has been readjusted by the BLS to an estimated 3,797,500, which is a 9,100 job difference.\n\nThrough September, there were about 3,200 fewer people employed in manufacturing than there were at the beginning of the year and about 5,000 fewer Georgians in the financial activities industry. The biggest change was in government, where there were nearly 18,000 fewer Georgians employed.\n\nGray told us via email that \"government losses are indeed still job losses.\"\n\nThere\u2019s been a slight increase so far this year in the number of Georgians employed in construction, education and health services and in the category of leisure and hospitality, according to the federal data.\n\nIn October, the most recent month available, there were about 3,800,100 Georgians employed, a slight uptick from September.

Certainly, some undocumented immigrants do commit violent crimes.\nAsked to support the claim of 1,800 murders, McClintock\u2019s office pointed, without explanation, to a report by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, titled Fiscal Year 2017 ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Report.\n\nMcClintock\u2019s office pointed to a 2017 ICE report, which includes the above data on homicide convictions and other offenses by \"arrested aliens.\" The crimes listed, however, did not necessarily take place in 2017, but instead over many years, according to immigration experts. \u00a0\n\u2018Outrageously high\u2019 \nThe document summarizes ICE\u2019s deportation efforts, including removing people in the country illegally following their prison terms for crimes from traffic offenses to homicide.\nWe asked several immigration experts to assess the report with a special focus on a chart that McClintock likely used for the 1,800 figure. The experts said that number is greatly inflated and that a closer inspection shows it does not represent murders in 2017, as the congressman claimed, but instead represents homicide convictions amassed over a much longer period of time. \u00a0\n\"1,800 murders by illegal immigrants is insanely and outrageously high,\" Alex Nowrasteh, a senior immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a Libertarian think-tank, wrote in an email. \"Illegal immigrants, about 3.75 percent of the population, did not commit 10.4 percent of murders in the U.S.,\" in 2017.\nThere were 17,284 homicides in the United States in 2017, according to FBI crime data, which does not include information on immigration status.\n\u2018Not a definitive source\u2019 \nNowrasteh said McClintock\u2019s 1,800 figure (actually 1,886 in the report) represents a combination of homicide charges (355) and homicide convictions (1,531), mostly for people who were released from prison and taken into ICE custody in 2017 for deportation. But the homicides, he said, took place \"over the last several decades,\" and not in a single year.\nAn ICE spokeswoman said she had no information about when the crimes occured.

In Massachusetts, Gov. Romney narrowed the gap between students of different races, raised testing standards, and put into place a merit scholarship ... He's a champion for bringing hope to education,\" Bush said in the Aug. 30 speech.\n\nWe have examined the claim about Massachusetts\u2019 achievement gap in July, when Romney himself said it. Here\u2019s another look.\n\nA little on Massachusetts schools\n\nIn 1993, lawmakers in Massachusetts passed a landmark reform law that included the groundwork for the state accountability system (later called Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System, or MCAS), authorized charter schools and invested more money in local school districts. Its universal goal was to raise educational standards for all Massachusetts kids.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBut it\u2019s worth noting that the Bay State is already a leader in student achievement. Massachusetts, which has a disproportionately high number of colleges and universities, some of the nation\u2019s wealthiest ZIP codes and a well-educated workforce, churns out many high-performing students.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBut the glare of those top achievers makes the shadow of struggling students that much darker. That is to say, Massachusetts still has a significant achievement gap. And because the kids at the top do so well, it\u2019s that much harder for everybody else to catch up.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Our scores are high, so as they get higher it\u2019s pretty hard to move up,\" said Kathleen Skinner, a policy director at the Massachusetts Teachers Association, a teachers union.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nNarrowing the gap\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen we checked this claim before, the Romney campaign pointed us to a 2007 MCAS test results summary, and specifically cited the 10th grade scores:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10th Grade Proficiency In Math\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 o\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2005, White: 29%; Black: 19%.

Gap = 16 points\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 o\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2007, White: 52%; Black: 40%. Gap = 12 points\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThat shows the achievement gap narrowing by 7 percentage points in math and by 4 percentage points in English.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBut the gains in other grades are smaller.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAmong eighth-graders, the gap tightened by only 1 point in math and 2 points in English. For seventh-graders, the change was 3 points in math, 5 points in English. Sixth grade: 1 point in math, no change in English. In fourth grade scores, the gap narrowed by 1 point in math and widened by 1 point in English. (Some of those are comparisons between 2006 scores and 2007, the only years provided in the test results summary.)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSkinner noted an important point about the MCAS: 10th-graders have to pass it in order to graduate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"They start paying attention,\" she said.\n\nWe also took a look at scores for the following year, comparing the achievement gap between 2007 and 2008. (These charts offer a slightly different comparison from the previous year, which looked at students who scored \"proficient\" on each test. The 2007-08 chart includes those scoring proficient and higher.) The best gains again were made by 10th graders who narrowed the gap by six points in English. But there was no change in the gap in math scores, and lower grades showed only one- or two-point gains, or no improvement at all, and the gap widened in a couple of instances, such as eighth-grade science scores. The 2008-2009 test score summary reflected a similar trend: small gains in some subjects and small setbacks in others.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBeverly Miyares, also with the Massachusetts Teachers Association, added that the dropout rate among black students in Massachusetts increased from 2002 to 2004, rising from 4.9 to 6.3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThat means more under-performing students who dropped out of school didn\u2019t drag down the overall average test scores.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nRomney\u2019s role\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIn claims such as this, we don\u2019t just consider the accuracy but also whether the speaker deserves credit: How responsible was Romney for narrowing the achievement gap?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"The most important point to make with Gov. Romney\u2019s record is that the reform he initiated was part of a much larger and longer movement that existed in Massachusetts,\" said Chad d'Entremont, executive director of the Rennie Center, which provides independent research about public education reform in Massachusetts.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nGlenn Koocher, executive director with the Massachusetts Association of School Committees, which represents school boards, was less generous: \"He had nothing to do with it. It\u2019s the teachers in the classrooms who are making the difference.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSkinner, the expert with the teachers\u2019 union, added that Romney was \"a somewhat absent \u2018education\u2019 governor. He was very agenda driven.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"We would argue that he didn\u2019t put anything in place\" to narrow the gap, she said.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWe also wondered whether Romney had pushed any initiatives specifically aimed at helping minority students. Koocher and Skinner both mentioned charter schools, which are favored by many Republicans.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"The charter school program was always popular among minority parents (and) any parents that wanted to get their kids out of the public schools,\" Koocher said, adding that vouchers commonly used to pay tuition at charter schools are unconstitutional in Massachusetts. Instead, the per-pupil state spending is deducted from the public school district\u2019s budget.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nRyan Williams, spokesman for the Romney campaign, said protecting the 1993 reform legislation was an important effort by Romney. He said there were attempts to repeal the requirement that 10th graders pass the test in order to graduate, and Romney \"stood firm on that and did not back down.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"It was one of the bigger things we had success in blocking,\" Williams said. \"A lot of what Romney did when he was governor was to preserve that legislation. He said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to roll these standards back.\u2019\"\n\nSkinner mentioned another, perhaps less obvious, initiative from Romney that helped many minority students: universal health care. Romney signed a health care reform law in Massachusetts that led to a 98 percent coverage rate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"In Massachusetts, all of our kids have health insurance, and I don\u2019t think anybody should underestimate the impact that has on learning. Our kids get vaccinated, they can go to the dentist, they can go to the eye doctor,\" she said. \"Their health is less of an issue than it is in other places.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOur ruling\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBush said, \"in Massachusetts, Gov. Romney narrowed the gap between students of different races.\"\n\nState education figures over two years support Bush\u2019s claim about learning gains when Romney was governor, although it\u2019s worth noting that some areas declined on Romney\u2019s watch, such as the drop-out rate. And it\u2019s always somewhat dubious to take a snapshot of statistics from only one or two years, when, as d'Entremont said, \"significant gains in student achievement don\u2019t happen overnight, and the gains in Massachusetts are the result of a 20-year reform effort.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s more, Romney, a single-term governor, should not get all the credit for improvement in the achievement gap, which is influenced by myriad factors.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBush\u2019s statement about Romney is partially accurate but omits a lot of important information and overstates the former governor\u2019s impact"}

Chet Edwards, D-Waco: \"And when Washington liberals wanted to take away our guns, Chet said no.\"\n\n\"Those are the ads that Democrats are running?\" Stewart marveled.\n\nOn Stewart's cue, we wanted to know more about Edwards' supposed showdown with gun-averse liberals.\n\nMegan Jacobs, an Edwards' spokeswoman, sent us a statement citing several pieces of legislation to defend his boast.\n\nNamely, on March 17, 2009, Edwards was one of 65 House Democrats who sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. \"As strong supporters of the Second Amendment, we were very concerned to see your recent remarks suggesting that the administration will push for reinstatement of the 1994 ban on 'assault weapons' and ammunition magazines,\" the letter says. \"Many of our constituents lawfully own and use these firearms and ammunition magazines that would be affected by a new ban.\"\n\nThe letter concludes: \"We would actively oppose any effort to reinstate the 1994 ban or to pass any similar law. We urge you to abandon this initiative and to focus instead on effective law enforcement strategies to enforce our community laws against violent criminals and drug traffickers.\"\n\nWhat prompted the letter? Jacobs pointed us to a February 2009 article on ABC News' website that quotes Holder saying: \"As President Obama indicated during the campaign, there are just a few gun-related changes that we would like to make, and among them would be to reinstitute the ban on the sale of assault weapons.\" Obama's campaign website said in 2008 that he supports making the expired federal assault weapons ban permanent \"as such weapons belong on foreign battlefields and not on our streets.\"\n\nSome background: In 1994, President Bill Clinton signed legislation prohibiting the sale of 19 types of semi-automatic assault weapons \u2014 like AK-47s, Uzis and revolving-cylinder shotguns \u2014 and imitation models of those guns. The law didn't apply to more than 650 other types of firearms that were manually operated by a bolt, pump, lever or slide action, were permanently nonfunctional and antique firearms. Also, the ban was set to expire in 2004 unless Congress reauthorized it, which it didn't.\n\nEdwards told us he voted for the ban in '94 after a 1991 shooting in Killeen left 24 dead. He said he opposed the ban's reauthorization because he didn't think it was effective in significantly reducing gun violence.\n\nWe wondered how many Texans would be affected by bringing back the ban. Tim Carroll, a spokesman with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told us that the agency doesn't track how many people own assault weapons.\n\nCarroll also told us that when the 1994 ban was implemented, it did not apply to firearms anyone already owned. Meaning: No one would had their guns taken away.\n\nSpeaking to Edwards' pro-gun bonafides, Jacobs noted that the congressman drew an \"A\" rating from the National Rifle Association, meaning it considers Edwards a \"solidly pro-gun candidate\" who \"has supported NRA positions on key votes in elective office,\" according to an explanation of the ratings on the NRA's website.\n\nThe letter to Holder signed by Edwards is one of 11 reasons the association lists on its website for endorsing the congressman. Other reasons include legislation Edwards cosponsored to repeal a gun ban in the District of Columbia, legislation he cosponsored to extend federal protections to state right-to-carry license and permits nationwide and legislation he cosponsored to prohibit gun confiscation during states of emergency.\n\n"}
{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Bill Hammond Says businesses pay roughly 60 percent of taxes in Texas.", "evidence": "As taxpayers faced the deadline for federal returns, Texas Gov. Rick Perry called for $1.6 billion in tax cuts for businesses in Texas.\n\nHis proposal was \"right and proper,\" business leader Bill Hammond said at Perry\u2019s April 15, 2013, press conference, because \"Texas businesses pay roughly 60 percent of all taxes that are paid in Texas today.\"\n\nPolitiFact Texas checked a similar statement in 2011, rating as Mostly True a state senator\u2019s claim that businesses \"pay most of the taxes\" in Texas.\n\nDo businesses currently pay 60 percent?\n\nHammond told us by phone that he intended his remark to encompass both state and local taxes.\n\nGenerally, businesses in Texas shoulder a higher-than-average initial tax burden because the state is one of only nine with no income tax on individuals. Experts agree, though, that the burden eventually shifts to individuals as businesses raise prices, lower wages or send less profit to shareholders.\n\nIn our 2011 fact-check, we looked at a report the Texas state comptroller publishes every two years predicting how much Texas will pull in from the state taxes that recently generated more than 2.5 percent of revenue. State law also requires the report to estimate how much will be paid in local school property taxes, although those are determined by and paid to individual districts, not the state.\n\nThe report breaks out the (predicted initial) impact each tax has on businesses and consumers -- i.e., how much they pay. The latest report, published March 7, 2013, examined:\n\n\n\nFour taxes paid entirely by businesses -- franchise tax (the main tax on businesses\u2019 revenues), natural gas tax, insurance premium tax and oil production tax.\n\n\n\nOne tax paid entirely by consumers -- cigarette tax.\n\n\n\nFour taxes shared by the two groups -- sales tax, gasoline tax, motor vehicle sales tax and school property tax.\n\n\n\nLooking ahead to Texas\u2019 fiscal year 2015 -- the 12 months ending Aug. 31, 2015 -- the comptroller predicted businesses would pay $37.2 billion (52 percent) with consumers paying $34.9 billion (48 percent).\n\nComptroller\u2019s spokesman R.J. DeSilva told us the eight state taxes in the report accounted for about 92 percent of state tax revenue in fiscal 2012.\n\nBut there are other taxes Texas businesses pay, including city and county property taxes that, like school property taxes, don\u2019t flow into state coffers.\n\nDick Lavine, senior fiscal analyst with the liberal, Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, told us by email, \"I hate to be making Hammond's case, but the bulk of the Comptroller's study includes only the major state taxes.\"\n\nDale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association business group, said by email that the taxes left out of the comptroller\u2019s report -- even if they\u2019re only 8 percent of total revenue -- fall primarily on businesses. Examples he gave: taxes on \"diesel, alcohol, tobacco excise (other than cigarettes), utility taxes, hotel taxes.\"\n\nAnother major cost to businesses, Craymer said, is the state\u2019s unemployment insurance tax -- money collected from employers under state law and redistributed by the Texas Workforce Commission as benefits to unemployed Texans.\n\nAs in our earlier story, Hammond and Craymer each recommended a report -- \"the most comprehensive comparative study,\" Craymer said -- done by consultants Ernst & Young for the Council on State Taxation, a Washington-based trade association representing corporate businesses.\n\nSpokesman Robert Wood at the Texas Association of Business, which Hammond heads, emailed us the council\u2019s 2009 report on state and local tax burdens, which said that businesses paid nearly 61 percent of Texas taxes in the state\u2019s fiscal 2008.\n\nA co-author of the report, Andrew Phillips at Ernst & Young, told us by email that according to their calculations, businesses paid about 60 percent of Texas taxes in fiscal 2009 and 61 percent in fiscal 2010 and 2011.\n\nBecause those percentages were noticeably higher than our comptroller-based percentage, we drilled down into the results.\n\nPhillips pointed out several differences between the two estimates. As noted above, the comptroller was projecting ahead to 2015, whereas Ernst & Young was speaking to years in the recent past.\n\nHe said Ernst & Young tabulated not just school property taxes but all local property taxes reported by the U.S. Census Bureau, adding up to a total $39 billion in fiscal 2011. Also, Ernst & Young included $2.4 billion in unemployment insurance tax paid by businesses in fiscal 2011, Phillips said.\n\nHammond said, \"The point is that businesses in Texas do pay, by any measure, more taxes than individuals and homeowners pay in Texas. ... We obviously believe that the Ernst & Young study is more correct for the last few years.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nHammond said businesses pay roughly 60 percent of the state\u2019s tax bill.\n\nBy our calculations using state projections that do not take into account all taxes, businesses will pay 52 percent of taxes in the state in 2015. In contrast, Hammond\u2019s source, a national group representing corporations, calculates that businesses paid 61 percent of all taxes in Texas in fiscal 2011.\n\nSo, estimates vary because different taxes are considered"}
{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Robert Hagan \"The governor won this state with 49 percent. We had some of the closest races in the House in history. So you\u2019re not dealing with this 70-30, like they want to make it.\"", "evidence": "Among the Gulf state governors, Florida Gov. Charlie Crist has been the most supportive, or maybe least critical, of the federal government's response to the Deepwater Horizon oil explosion.But that hasn't stopped him from tossing some jabs at perhaps an easier target -- BP.In an interview with CNN's Candy Crowley, Crist echoed comments by Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink that some Florida businesses are on the verge of bankruptcy because of BP's slow processing of claims. \"We are demanding that they do better,\" Crist said on June 6, 2010. \"And what I mean by that is that the attorney general, Bill McCollum, and I have asked former attorneys general Bob Butterworth and Jim Smith to set up a task force of lawyers in order to be prepared for additional compensation when that becomes necessary. And we are pretty certain that it will. We have some of the best attorneys in the country here in Florida. And they have dealt with issues like this in the past, some other maritime issues that we have had to be faced with. So we are putting that together.\"But in the near term -- in the short-term, if you will, we want these claims to be responded to much more quickly. BP is setting up claims offices throughout the state. But we want them to answer those claims more rapidly, because these people need help. And we have to be there to try to make them as whole as we can during this very difficult process. There are a lot of businesses impacted by it. It is not just restaurateurs and the hoteliers, it's fishermen, it's oyster fishermen and a lot of people along the coast who really depend on the Gulf of Mexico for their very livelihood.\"With the oil spill continuing to threaten Florida, we wanted to check Crist's statement about the claims process, specifically if BP has set up offices throughout Florida.Under federal law, BP is obligated to pay for the cost to clean up the spill. But its liability is limited to $75 million when it comes to paying economic damage claims from businesses and people affected by the spill. BP has said it will pay all \"legitimate\" claims, even those beyond the $75 million cap, and some Democrats in Congress are considering whether to lift the $75 million cap and apply it to BP retroactively.BP has organized an extensive process to manage economic damage claims.The company announced on June 15 that it has paid out $16 million to businesses that have filed claims in excess of $5,000, and already issued 25,000 claims checks totalling $63 million. By June 20, BP says it will have paid out $85 million.Claims are coming in through BP's website, www.bp.com/claims and through a 1-800 number, company officials say.As Crist suggested, BP also has set up 25 claims centers scattered around the affected areas.There are 10 claims centers in Florida, more than any other state (Louisiana has seven, Alabama has five and Mississippi has three). Eight of the 10 Florida claims centers are clustered in the Panhandle, between Escambia County and Wakulla counties. The other two centers are in the Florida Keys in Key West and Marathon. You can see a complete list here. (If you're considering filing a claim in person, BP asks that you first get a claim number by calling 1-800-440-0858.)Crist said \"BP is setting up claims offices throughout the state,\" to help process economic damage claims from businesses and people affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion. BP has opened 10 claims centers in Florida, more than in any other state. Crist's use of the word \"throughout,\" kind of has us stumbling a bit. The claims centers are concentrated primarily in the Panhandle, with two others in the Florida Keys. There are no centers between Cedar Key and Naples on the west coast of the state and none on the east coast. While it is true that\u00a0reports of oil have been concentrated to the Panhandle and the Keys,\u00a0the\u00a0spill has the potential to impact all parts of the state, regardless how close the oil is to the shore"}

I don't think he knows he did, but he did,\" Gillibrand told the editorial board at the Des Moines Register. \u00a0\nShe repeats it often, so we checked her claim.\nIt quickly became clear that evaluating the truthfulness of her statement would not be as simple as searching for her sponsored legislation in a Congressional database and seeing which bills passed.\nThe list\nWe approached Gillibrand\u2019s campaign for evidence of her claim. Spokeswoman Meredith Kelly provided a list of legislation the senator sponsored or co-sponsored that made it into law in some form, typically as part of other bills, during the 115th Congress in 2017-18.\nThis list had 17\u00a0pieces of legislation, including an amendment, and the 18th item was several bills intended to change sexual harassment policies in Congress.\nWith one exception, the renaming of a post office, the bills did not follow a simple path from her sponsorship to a signing by the president.\nIn some cases, bills originated in her office, but the House version was signed into law. This includes a bill regarding a hydroelectric project at the Cannonsville Dam, east of Binghamton. In this case, Rep. John Faso, a Republican, sponsored identical legislation in the House one month\u00a0after Gillibrand introduced her bill. His bill ultimately passed both houses. Gillibrand\u2019s bill, meanwhile, had been amended in the Senate. At the time, Faso was a member of the Republican majority in the House, and Gillibrand was in the Democratic minority in the Senate. \u00a0\nIn another case, the House version of a bill to conduct a study in Oswego was signed, though Gillibrand carried a related bill in the Senate. \u00a0\nIn two of the bills that became law, Gillibrand was an original co-sponsor, meaning that she signed on to the bill when it was introduced. This happened with a bill sponsored by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, to provide\u00a0benefits to public safety officers and their survivors. Another, sponsored by Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, allows military families more flexibility in where they live before or after a new assignment. That bill became law as part of a large defense spending bill.

Gillibrand\u2019s Computer Science Career Education Act was signed into law after it became a provision of another bill, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education For The 21st Century Act. Provisions of another one of Gillibrand\u2019s bills, which promotes hands-on manufacturing and learning, was also included in the career and technical education act. A bill aimed at reducing wealth inequality was included in a defense spending bill.

The first? He lacks experience. The second? Elorza, the firefighters say, supports a municipal income tax. PolitiFact Rhode Island examined this claim when it was made by Cianci last month and ruled it False.\nThe third? \"Elorza wants to teach our public school children about the \u2018non-existence of God,\u2019\" the piece said.\nThe basis for the claim is cited in the mailer: an article that Elorza, a law professor \u00a0and former Housing Court judge, had published in the University of Pittsburgh Law Review in 2010. The 54-page article, \"Secularism and the Constitution: Can Government Be Too Secular?,\" sets out to answer a question.\n\"If scientific evidence leads us to conclude that a particular aspect of God cannot be true, can this be taught in the public schools?\" wrote Elorza, who is on a leave of absence from Roger Williams University School of Law, where he teaches constitutional law and other subjects.\nThe article defines four views of God: the atheist view in which God does not exist; the deist view, which holds that God created the universe but has no influence on daily events; the theist view, which holds that God is not only the creator but also an intervenor in the world\u2019s affairs; and what Elorza calls the \"memist\" view in which God lays down a moral code but \"resides entirely in the minds of its adherents.\"\nElorza focuses on the theist view, arguing that it violates the laws of physics. Science, he says, proves that the theist God does not exist. And U.S. courts have generally ruled that something can be taught in the public schools that may contradict a religious belief if science supports it. Evolution is one example that Elorza gives.\nAs for the three other views of God, Elorza makes it clear that their existence cannot be proven one way or another. Thus, no argument can be made to support teaching that they do not exist, and doing so would violate the Constitution, according to Elorza.\nSo what is his answer to the question that he posed at the beginning of the article?\n\"I conclude, first, that teaching that the theist God does not exist would not violate any of the underlying values and second, that the consequences of doing so are not as far-reaching as may be initially believed,\" Elorza wrote.\nElorza may have concluded, in his lengthy academic paper, that it is legally defensible to teach the non-existence of one particular aspect of God, but nowhere in the article does he say that he wants schools to teach it.\nMuch has been written by others on local blogs on this subject (see here and here), but we couldn\u2019t find any public statements made by Elorza advocating for schools to adopt the position.\n\n"}
{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Stephen Kretzmann Georgia's U.S. senators voted for legislation that would \"gut clean air protections and increase oil dependence.\"", "evidence": "Are Georgia's two U.S. senators too beholden to \"Big Oil\" companies?\n\nThat's the claim on a website created by Oil Change International, critical about the positions of some U.S. senators on some oil and energy issues. The site, www.bobbinginpetroleum.org, has images of 46 senators, including Georgia's Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson.\n\nMake no mistake, Oil Change International has an agenda. It identifies itself on its website as \"a research and advocacy organization that exists to force progress in the energy industry towards an environmentally and socially sustainable energy future.\" The website also proclaims that the tax-exempt organization \"campaigns to expose the true costs of oil and facilitate the coming transition towards clean energy. We are dedicated to identifying and overcoming political barriers to that transition.\"\n\nThe website says Chambliss and Isakson have accepted a combined $331,000 in what it dubbed \"dirty energy contributions.\" The largest contributor, about $128,000, was Atlanta-based Southern Co.\n\nFor visual effect, the heads and torsos of the two senators are floating in rubber duckies in oil-stained water. An oil barrel is in the background.\n\nAJC PolitiFact Georgia certainly could not ignore an opportunity to dive deeper into this website. We also wanted to know if Chambliss and Isakson voted for legislation that \"gut clear air protections and increase oil dependence.\"\n\nWe reached out to the offices of both senators to see if they disputed the claims against their bosses. Both defended their votes in favor of legislation the website criticized. Isakson's Senate seat is up for re-election on Nov. 2.\n\nWe decided to dig deeper into the claim about the resolution, since the staff of both senators seemed to have a larger beef with that.\n\nThe legislation in question was written by U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska. It aimed to prevent the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from formulating regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The first of the new regulations could take effect in 2011. Murkowski argued Congress needs more input in the process, but her bill failed by a 53 to 47 vote. If Murkowski's resolution had been approved, some activists argued it would have a negative impact on clean air regulations. Bobbing in Petroleum called the legislation the \"Big Oil Bailout.\"\n\nChambliss and Isakson argued in support of the legislation largely on economic grounds. The legislation was a skirmish in the ongoing battle in Washington over efforts to pass sweeping energy legislation. The House passed a bill last year to establish a cap on carbon emissions, but the legislation has run into firm opposition in the Senate. Many Republican leaders say the so-called \"cap and trade\" legislation would become a job-killing tax. Pass the legislation, they argue, and you put Americans out of work.\n\n\"This backdoor attempt to regulate greenhouse gases will have dramatic negative effects on our manufacturing sector while also causing significant increases in the cost of power generation,\" Isakson said in a statement after the June 10 vote.\n\nChambliss said in a speech on the Senate floor that day that the EPA's actions would require more cash-strapped farmers to get federal Clean Air Act permits, hurting many of them financially.\n\nSo would the Murkowski bill \"gut clean air protections and increase oil dependence\"?\n\nFirst, we must go back to 2007. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 vote that the EPA must consider putting controls on carbon dioxide and other gases in automobile exhaust. The majority rejected arguments by the administration of then-President George W. Bush, a Republican, that the Clean Air Act does not treat carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases as \"pollutants,\" and thus does not give the EPA the authority to regulate them.\n\nIn September 2009, the EPA, under the administration of President Barack Obama, a Democrat, announced plans to require better gas mileage for cars and trucks and the first-ever rules on vehicle greenhouse gas emissions. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson wants to establish a greenhouse gas emission for cars and light trucks in model years 2012 to 2016.\n\nMurkowski introduced her legislation in January to stop the EPA effort.\n\nStephen Kretzmann, who created the Bobbing in Petroleum site, said the EPA regulations would reduce automotive oil consumption by more than 1.8 billion barrels, citing comments Jackson made in a statement to a House of Representatives energy subcommittee.\n\n\"Eliminating the EPA standard would forfeit ... one-third of its greenhouse gas emissions reductions,\" Jackson said.\n\nKretzmann also noted a letter by former EPA Administrator Russell Train urging the Senate to vote down the Murkowski bill. Train said the legislation would roll back Clean Air Act protections.\n\n\"If Congress had removed EPA's ability to regulate greenhouse gases, industry would have been on more solid ground to challenge them in the future. And I have no doubt that they will, if given the chance,\" said Kretzmann, who said he's worked on energy and oil issues for nearly two decades.\n\u00a0\nJonas Monast, who has expertise in federal climate protection policies, agreed Murkowski's legislation would adversely impact the EPA's ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. However, he said it would not impact U.S. Department of Transportation's ability to increase vehicle efficiency, a point that's been made by other nonpartisan observers. Cars, buses and trucks account for about half of all cancers attributed to outdoor sources of air toxins, federal officials say. The EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are working on a new rating system that rates the overall fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions of different vehicles to help consumers before buying a new car, SUV, truck or van.\n\nWould the bill increase oil dependence?\n\n\"I don't think it's possible to predict at this point,\" said Monast, senior policy counsel at the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Studies at Duke University.\n\nObama announced in May a plan to impose mileage and pollution limits on vehicles, particularly SUVs and trucks. Obama used the BP oil spill to highlight the need to rely less on fossil fuels. The EPA argued Murkowski's resolution would hurt the president's plan and continue America's dependence on foreign oil. Murkowski argued her resolution would not impact the federal Department of Transportation's ability to regulate fuel efficiency.\n\nEvery expert we talked to said the Murkowski legislation would hurt the EPA's efforts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. But the experts also said it would not impact federal transportation officials from moving forward with efforts to increase vehicle efficiency. Whether or not the bill would increase oil dependence is still debatable"}

Gavin Newsom changed that approach in 2008 after a 21-year-old undocumented man was arrested for killing three members of a family in San Francisco. The man had been arrested before, at age 17, and convicted of attempted robbery and assault but was not reported to federal immigration authorities.\nFormer San Francisco County Supervisor David Campos strongly opposed the policy change. Asked about Harris\u2019 statement, he said \"it just doesn\u2019t fly.\"\n\"With all due respect to Sen. Harris, who has been a friend, I don\u2019t understand how she can say that,\" said Campos, who led the board\u2019s effort to reverse the policy, and is now chairperson of the San Francisco Democratic Party.\n\"Turning over young people and children who were accused of a crime that later turned out they did not commit was not an unintended consequence of what was going on. It was precisely what was going on and what we were trying to avoid,\" Campos said. \"You can\u2019t rewrite history.\"\nThe Board of Supervisors voted to overturn Newsom\u2019s policy in October 2009 and overrode his veto the next month, according to a Mercury-News article.\nBut that wasn\u2019t the end of the controversy. Newsom refused to enforce the reversal.\n\"His administration cited a memo from City Attorney Dennis Herrera, which argued that the supervisors\u2019 reform would be \"likely to result in a federal legal challenge,\" potentially to the sanctuary city law as a whole \u2014 although it also noted that \"the law in this area is not well developed,\" the paper\u00a0reported.\nHarris expressed the same concerns in a speech at Stanford University in 2009, as cited in a CNN.com article that reviewed Harris\u2019 support for the policy.\nHarris explained her position this way:\n\"There was then an initiative that was written by the board of supervisors that was passed and there was opposition to that but it did pass,\" Harris said in the 2009 speech. \"And so we're gonna have to wait to see how the courts interpret what it means. From my perspective, I think that it would be in conflict with federal law, and we have to follow the law. We have to follow that law. You may not agree with it, but you know, that's why we have a process where you can challenge laws. And it is the law.\"\nNewsom\u2019s policy was eventually changed by his successor in the mayor\u2019s office, Ed Lee, who ordered in May 2011 that most juveniles with family ties to the Bay Area not be reported to ICE, the Mercury-News added.\n\n"}

{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Rob Portman \"In the month of July alone, EU exports to South Korea increased by over 36 percent. A lot of that is our market share. Those are our farmers and our service providers who are suffering.\"", "evidence": "As former U.S. Trade Representative during the presidency of George W. Bush, Sen. Rob Portman has become a Republican point man on trade in the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe day before President Barack Obama announced a $447 billion proposal to boost the economy and create jobs, \u00a0Portman joined a group of GOP Senators Sept. 7, 2011, at a Capitol Hill news conference to suggest that Obama could create jobs quickly by sending pending trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama to Congress, where all three would likely pass with bipartisan support.\n\nPortman argued countries which have adopted trade pacts are gaining market share in those three nations that would go to U.S. farmers and companies but for the stalled trade agreements. Noting that the European Union passed a trade agreement with Korea in July, he backed up his point by citing Korean customs service statistics that he deemed \"startling.\"\n\n\"In the month of July alone, EU exports to South Korea increased by over 36 percent,\" Portman said. \"A lot of that is our market share. Those are our farmers and our service providers who are suffering. By the way, during that same period, U.S. exports to Korea increased only 2.9 percent.\"\n\nObserving that it\u2019s now easier for Korea to import vehicles from Europe rather than the U.S., \u00a0Portman declared: \"We need to move and move quickly here before we lose even more market share.\"\n\nDid EU exports really jump that much while U.S. numbers dropped? And was it at the expense of U.S. farmers and our service providers? PolitiFact Ohio decided to check into Portman\u2019s claim.\n\nWe contacted his office to ask where he got his statistics. They passed along an August 25 statement from South Korea\u2019s embassy.\n\n\"Merely one month after the Korea-EU Free Trade Agreement (FTA) went into effect on July 1, 2011, EU exports to Korea rose 36.7 percent compared to the same month last year,\" the statement said. \"Meanwhile U.S. exports to Korea increased by just 2.9 percent over the same period, according to Korea Customs Service. In July 2010, U.S. exports were greater in value than EU exports to Korea. One year later, however, the opposite is true, as the U.S.Korea FTA (KORUS FTA) remains unratified.\"\n\nIt went onto urge passage of the trade agreement, claiming that \"continued KORUS FTA delay is placing U.S. farmers, manufacturers, service providers and workers at a significant disadvantage in the Korean market, jeopardizing potentially billions of dollars in sales opportunities and tens of thousands of American jobs.\"\n\nThat statement certainly backs up the numbers that Portman used. But the situation grew murkier after we examined trade data for other months to see whether the trade agreement\u2019s passage actually escalated EU trade with Korea, as the news release claimed.\n\nEmbassy spokesman John Brinkley supplied trade figures from Korea\u2019s \"Ministry of Knowledge Economy,\" which is similar to the U.S. Commerce Department. He said that Korea\u2019s Customs Service releases its data in the Korean language - which PolitiFact doesn\u2019t understand - while the Ministry of Knowledge Economy releases English language data.\n\nBrinkley said the agencies use slightly different methodologies to compute their statistics, so their numbers are a bit off from each other, but often show similar trends. For instance, the Ministry of Knowledge Economy data sheet for July shows a 44.9 percent growth rate in goods that South Korea obtained from the EU, (instead of the customs service\u2019s 36.7 percent) \u00a0and an 8.5 percent uptick in goods from the U.S (instead of the other agency\u2019s 2.9 percent). It also showed that Korea got 8.4 percent of its imports from the United States that month, and 10.3 percent of its imports from the European Union.\n\nIf the July trade agreement had rapidly escalated the EU\u2019s share of exports to Korea, one would expect that trend to continue in August. It did not.\n\nAugust statistics released Sept. 5 from the Ministry of Knowledge Economy show U.S. exports were 22 percent greater than last August, outstripping the EU\u2019s 14.8 percent growth rate. That month, 9.2 percent of South Korea\u2019s imports came from the United States, 8.8 percent came from the European Union.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Ministry of Knowledge Economy statistics for the first half of the year, showed South Korea got 8.9 percent of its imports from the EU in the six months before the trade agreement kicked in, and 8.6 percent of its imports from the United States. The EU\u2019s year-over-year growth rate in those months was 25.5 percent, compared with 11.5 percent for the United States.\n\nBrinkley said it would be impossible to prove the July surge in exports from the EU resulted from the trade agreement, although plenty of anecdotal evidence to that effect was reported in the Korean press, such as EU companies saying they\u2019d \u00a0lower their wholesale prices in Korea, and Korean retailers saying they would lower prices on EU goods after the trade agreement was approved.\n\n\"Why the US/EU ratio was less pronounced in August is anybody's guess,\" Brinkley said in an email.\n\nBrinkley supplied Korean Customs Service data that also showed U.S. exports to South Korea outstripping that month\u2019s EU exports. He indicated U.S. exports to South Korea for August rose 33.8 percent \"year-on-year,\" while EU exports rose 17.1 percent. Still, he said the \"average July-August 2011 export growth\" was 17.8 percent for the U.S, and 26.5 percent for the EU.\n\nHe attributed August\u2019s uptick in U.S. exports to Boeing\u2019s delivery of three F-15 fighter planes to South Korea, as well as increased U.S. grain exports occasioned by South Korea\u2019s unusually severe August monsoon season. Brinkley said both trade agreements are structured in such a way that grain tariffs are phased out over periods ranging from 5 to 10 years, \"so EU grain is not yet significantly cheaper than US grain.\"\n\nTodd Tucker, who is research director of Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch, which opposes trade agreements, noted that Portman and other trade agreement advocates focus only on exports, and ignore imports that could cost U.S. jobs. He also said \"so-called FTAs\" \u00a0do not necessarily increase exports.\n\n\"In both Thailand and Taiwan (also not FTA partners), the U.S. is selling more in dollar terms than it was in 2005,\" Tucker said in an email. \"In contrast, the U.S. has lost rank and market share in Australia since 2005, and the U.S. has had an FTA in place with Australia over that entire time period. In sum, there are a \u00a0lot of ways to boost exports, but history shows that FTAs are not one of them.\"\n\nSo where does that leave Portman\u2019s statement?\n\nThe senator accurately quoted the trade stats he obtained from the Korean embassy\u2019s August 25 news release.\n\nBut the data doesn\u2019t support the other part of his claim -- his underlying point that countries which have adopted trade pacts are gaining market share that would go to U.S. farmers and companies.\n\nIt is contradicted by the data for August trade available from Korea\u2019s Ministry of Knowledge Economy released two days before Portman spoke. And statistics for the six months before the EU trade agreement kicked in show EU trade growth"}
{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Donald Trump \"Iraq has the second-largest oilfields in the world (behind) Saudi Arabia.\"", "evidence": "During an April 14, 2011, interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, businessman and potential Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said Iraq is strategically important to the United States because of its vast supply of oil.\n\nTrump said the United States spent $1.5 trillion on the Iraq War, and it could all go down the drain because the nation is so unstable.\n\n\"Iraq has the second-largest oilfields in the world. Fifteen trillion dollars worth of oil, second to Saudi Arabia. We go over, we decapitate their armies. Their armies are wiped out. They have weak armies, it is a corrupt society anyway, I mean, it's totally corrupt what is going on over there. We then leave in Iran which has fought for years back and forth, back and forth, because they were basically of equal strength, well, now they are not. Iran will come in. And they will take over Iraq, within two seconds after we leave, forget it, it is not even a contest. ...\n\n\"So, they are going to have the second-best oilfields in the world, second-biggest oilfields in the world that we made possible with our soldiers, thousands of people dead, wounded and \u2026 less importantly, $1.5 trillion. So, I said very simply. That if it is me, we take the oil. You know, in the old days, when you win a country, you win a country. Now with our stupid people, we win a country, we lose money, we lose soldiers, we lose lives, and then we leave.\"\n\nWe won\u2019t address Trump's opinions about Iraq and the war, but we did wonder whether he was right to say that \"Iraq has the second-largest oilfields in the world (behind) Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s comment was rather disjointed, so we had to do a bit of interpretation before looking at the statistics. (We e-mailed his office but did not hear back.)\n\nBased on the wording and context, we concluded that by referring to the \"second-largest oilfields in the world,\" Trump meant oil reserves, not production. He clearly indicates that Iraq\u2019s fields are a valuable resource, and we concluded that the real prize is the oil remaining to be extracted, rather than what is being produced.\n\nSecond, we concluded that Trump had actually used the \"oilfields\" statistic to refer, interchangeably, to two distinct periods in time -- right before the Iraq War, and the present day. He used the same statistic in both referring to the eve of the Iraq War and also to what could happen in the near future if we abandon Iraq and Iran takes over. So we will look at the figures for 2002, the last full year before the Iraq War, and 2010, the most current statistics available.\n\nSo do the figures back up Trump\u2019s claim? We turned to the website of the Energy Information Administration, the federal agency that compiles energy statistics.\n\nOne caveat: EIA says its estimates of energy reserves are from a variety of sources and may not be precise. Experts confirmed for us they can be inconsistent and sometimes exaggerated.\n\nThat said, let\u2019s see what EIA says about Iraq and other countries.\n\nIn 2002, Iraq\u2019s proven reserves of crude oil amounted to 112.5 billion barrels. That indeed ranks second to Saudi Arabia, with 261.8 billion barrels.\n\nBy 2010, Iraq\u2019s proven reserves had risen slightly, to 115 billion barrels, but other countries passed it by. Saudi Arabia was still first, with 262.6 billion barrels, but new to the top tier were Venezuela (211.2 billion barrels), Canada (175.2 billion barrels) and then Iran (137.9 billion barrels).\n\nSo currently -- or in the near future, a time when Trump says Iran would \"take over Iraq\" within \"about two minutes after we leave\" -- Iraq ranks fifth in the world, not second, at least according to this estimate.\n\nSo where does this leave us? For the part of the comment in which Trump appeared to be talking about the eve of the Iraq War, he\u2019s correct that Iraq had \"the second-largest oilfields in the world \u2026 to Saudi Arabia.\" But where he flashes forward to a hypothetical, near-term takeover by Iran, Trump\u2019s statistic is off slightly, since Iraq -- while still high on the list -- has been passed by three additional countries"}

In some states, you can choose from as many as 200 kinds.\n\nRhode Island is no exception. You can pick from five specialty plates, with more on the way, not counting traditional ones for firefighters and the military. They\u2019ve become so prominent that one -- promoting Plum Beach Lighthouse -- appears on a billboard on a stretch of Route 95 traveled by 100,000 motorists a day.\n\n\"Voted the \u2018best specialty plate in American,\u2019 \" the billboard reads.\n\nNow that\u2019s license to brag!\n\nBut is it true? We looked to our own navigational beacon, the Truth-O-Meter, to guide us.\n\nOur voyage first took us to the billboard near the Providence-Pawtucket line, best visible to southbound motorists. It shows the license plate, with its idyllic image of the Plum Beach Lighthouse surrounded by placid blue waters and two sport fishermen in a boat.\n\n\"Get yours now!\" reads the billboard, directing people to a Web site. \"Thousands sold!\"\n\nThe license plate is a fundraising tool for Friends of Plum Beach Lighthouse, which acquired the 1897 lighthouse 22 years ago with the goal of preserving it. The spark-plug style lighthouse, off North Kingstown in Narragansett Bay\u2019s West Passage, was abandoned following construction of the Jamestown Bridge in 1941.\n\nSeeking to raise funds to paint the lighthouse, the organization got General Assembly approval in late 2009 for a license plate commemorating the landmark. Since then, the group has sold nearly 4,300 plates, the most of any specialty plate in Rhode Island, president David Zapatka told us.\n\nSpecialty plates cost $41.50, with $20 going toward the sponsoring group. So far, $86,000 has been raised for the lighthouse, some of which was used to paint the landmark and install solar-powered lighting, Zapatka said.\n\nFollowing the debut of the lighthouse tag, a local license plate lover nominated it for a competition held by the Automobile License Plate Collectors Association (ALPCA). Every year, its 3,000 members nominate license plates -- only new ones, by the way -- and then vote on the best.\n\nALPCA announced that its members selected from 12 finalists from 2010. Half were so-called \"general issue\" plates, the kind that states redesign every few years and which most motorists get when they register their vehicles. The other half were specialty plates.\n\nNew Mexico\u2019s bright turquoise and gold plate took first. Plum Beach Lighthouse got second. While it was honored as the runner-up, it received no accolades for \"best\" anything.\n\nSo we asked Zapatka to shine some light on the billboard\u2019s claim.\n\n\"I figured we might get called on that,\" he said immediately. \u00a0\"Rather than put up on the billboard, \u2018We are the second best plate in America,\u2019 we changed the wording to say we are the \u2018best specialty plate in America.\u2019 Did they officially come out and say, \u2018You are the best specialty in America\u2019? No.\"\n\nBut, he insisted, Plum Beach Lighthouse beat out the other five specialty plates, not to mention all but one of the other plates.\n\n\"Is it a stretch? Yes,\" he acknowledged. But, he said, \"there is no other specialty plate that finished higher than us in the competition. \u2026 It\u2019s a marketing scheme.\"\n\nWhat does ALPCA think about how the Rhode Island group is tooting its horn?\n\nContest coordinator Gus Oliver, who didn\u2019t vote since he was running the contest, called it a \"misnomer\" and said Friends of Plum Beach Lighthouse \"may be stretching\" the contest results in making its claim. A few years ago, there was a separate category for specialty plates, he said, but not anymore.\n\n\"The most accurate statement is that, of the specialty plates, it scored the highest or the best,\" said Oliver, who\u2019s from Tulsa, Okla.\n\nBut Oliver didn\u2019t take issue with the billboard.\n\n\"They put a positive spin on it,\" he said, adding, \"if there had been separate voting [for the two kinds of plates], I feel certain it would have represented the outcome.\"\n\nZapatka, who works in media and is quite familiar with PolitiFact, asked, \"Are you going to light our pants on fire?\"\n\nHmmm, we can see it now: a Plum Beach Lighthouse plate that reads PANTS-AFIRE.\n\nNah. You just can\u2019t go around tossing matches at non profit groups that are trying to raise money for causes as cherished as lighthouses. Besides, the license plate got more votes than any other specialty tag.\n\nStill, the lighthouse group knew it was making a claim that wasn\u2019t quite accurate.\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re stamping their plate BRLY-TRU.\n\n(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

Experts told us there are nuances.\nStock market winning streaks\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average includes the stocks of the 30 largest and most powerful companies in the country (Wal-Mart, Disney, Pfizer, for example). The Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500) consists of the 500 most commonly traded stocks and represents about 80 percent of the total value of U.S. stock markets.

{"label": "pants-fire", "claim": "Glenn Beck Says Michelle Obama has 43 people on her staff; Nancy Reagan had just 3.", "evidence": "Glenn Beck rekindled a falsehood about the size of Michelle Obama's staff last week, comparing the first lady to Marie Antoinette, and citing her large staff as evidence that the Obamas are \"out of control.\"\n\nOn his radio program on Feb. 25, 2011, Beck asked a researcher to find out how many people are now on Michelle Obama's staff. Beck then immediately supplied his own estimate.\n\n\"It's like 43,\" Beck said.\n\nAnd, Beck said, \"They just hired a personal shopper who is going to coordinate all of her purchases and look for discounts if they're available.\"\n\n\"Forty-three people!\" Beck added.\n\n\"I think Nancy Reagan may have been the one who had the most people on the staff. She had three. Three!\"\n\n\"The first lady's office needs 43 people? For what? These people are out of control. It is really Marie Antoinette.\"\n\nAllegations that Michelle Obama has an excessively large staff compared to other first ladies is nothing new. In 2009, FactCheck.org and Snopes.com debunked the claim circulated in a chain e-mail that Michelle Obama had an \"unprecedented\" number of staffers, with 22.\n\nHere, Beck has upped the alleged number of staffers to 43. And he claims that when Nancy Reagan was first lady, she had just three.\n\nWe went first to the 2010 Annual Report to Congress on White House Staff, the latest online data, and did a search for anyone with the words \"first lady\" in their title. That turned up 15 staffers. We also searched \"social\" and found three more on Michelle Obama's staff.\n\nBut titles don't give the full picture. Myra Gutin, an expert on first ladies and politics at Rider University in New Jersey, said that as of 2009, Michelle Obama had 22 people on her staff. Gutin didn't have any more recent tallies, but she highly doubts it nearly doubled to the 43 cited by Beck.\n\nCatherine McCormick-Lelyveld, a spokeswoman for Michelle Obama, told us via e-mail that Michelle Obama's staff is now closer to 25 people.\n\nHow does that stack up?\n\n\"First lady Michelle Obama\u2019s staff is no different in size than that of her predecessor, Laura Bush -- around 25 people -- and is based on a similar staffing model,\" said McCormick-Lelyveld. \"So suggestions that our staff is larger are wrong. While every first lady approaches the job differently, the responsibilities of the office of the first lady have grown over the years to include planning and hosting hundreds of events at the White House and across the city of D.C., planning and supporting domestic and foreign travel with and without President Obama, receiving, cataloging and responding to thousands of pieces of mail, and supporting the first lady\u2019s active schedule in support of the President -- hence the staff size for both Mrs. Bush and Mrs. Obama.\"\n\nThe size of a first lady's staff fluctuates year to year. First ladies typically have several staff members each handling correspondence, press, social engagements and projects. At 25, Michelle Obama's staff is similar in size to her immediate predecessors.\n\nAccording to an Associated Press story on October 6, 2009, Laura Bush had a staff of between 24 and 26 by the end of President George W. Bush's term in 2009, citing Anita McBride, Laura Bush's chief of staff.\n\u00a0\nAnd according to the Clinton Presidential Library, the size of Hillary Rodham Clinton's staff fluctuated from 13 in October 1993 to 19 by March 2000, the AP story said.\n\nBeck singled out Nancy Reagan, and claimed she had just three employees on her staff.\n\nOur first stop to check that was the Ronald Reagan Library, where Archivist Kelly D. Barton forwarded us a list -- based on the internal Executive Office of the President phone books -- of all the full-time staffers who worked in the first lady's office. In all, that came to 53 employees. But they weren't all serving at once, of course. So we turned to Sheila Tate, vice chair of the Washington, D.C., communications firm Powell Tate, who was Nancy's Reagan's press secretary.\n\nBy Tate's off-the-top-of-the-head count, there were 15 people on First Lady Nancy Reagan's staff. That includes four on the press team (including Tate); two in the projects office; two in the advance office; three in the social office; a personal secretary and her assistant; and the chief of staff and his assistant.\n\nThere are other people who worked in the East Wing, Tate said, including a large social and calligraphy staff that has nothing to do with changes in administrations.\n\nTate's not sure what jobs Beck counted to get his number for Nancy Reagan's staff (and our efforts to reach his show were unsuccessful), but by any measure, she said, the claim that Nancy Reagan had only three on her staff is \"clearly wrong.\"\n\nStacy A. Cordery,\u00a0 a history professor at Monmouth College who serves as bibliographer for the National First Ladies' Library in Ohio, said the role of first ladies has expanded over the decades, and so has the size of the staffs.\n\n\"Edith Roosevelt hired the first social secretary, Isabelle Hagner,\" Cordery told us via e-mail. \"Ever since 1901, first ladies have had assistance carrying out their duties--duties which are not defined in any job description nor laid out in any part of the Constitution.\u00a0 The first lady's correspondence is massive and her obligations as the 'hostess' of the White House have not decreased over time. Once first ladies took on causes (there were some before Eleanor Roosevelt, but she fundamentally changed Americans' expectations of the first lady) then their need for help increased. Modern first ladies like Lady Bird Johnson, Rosalyn Carter, Betty Ford, Barbara Bush, Hillary Clinton, Laura Bush and Nancy Reagan, have all used many more staff people than three.\"\n\nAnd Beck's comment that Michelle Obama \"just hired a personal shopper\" also is wrong. The claim appears to have its roots in a Feb. 21, 2011, Washington Post report that, \"according to several people with knowledge of her White House arrangement,\" Chicago boutique owner Ikram Goldman's role as \"shopper in chief\" has been taken over by Michelle Obama's longtime personal assistant, Meredith Koop.\n\n\"There has been no recent addition of a personal shopper,\" said McCormick-Lelyveld. \"Like previous first ladies, Mrs. Obama has a personal aide who is part of the residence staff and who provides general support for the first lady, including purchasing clothes when necessary.\"\n\nSo to summarize, Michelle Obama has a staff of 25, not 43 as Beck claimed. Nancy Reagan had a staff of about 15 (not 3, as Beck claimed). The size of Michelle Obama's staff is similar to that of her immediate predecessors. And she did not just hire a new personal shopper. In short, Beck's outrage is based on numbers that are wildly off the mark"}

After graduating in 1972, he was a pilot in the U.S. Air Force until he was discharged in 1977, with the rank of captain, according to his biographical entry in the Texas State Directory.\nIn his autobiographical 2008 book, \"On My Honor,\" Perry describes his return: \"Dad still thought I was there to do chores. I reminded him that I had just finished commanding a multi-million-dollar piece of government equipment and a number of grown men. He reminded me that the chores still needed tending to.\"\nIn a profile published by the Austin American-Statesman, Perry is quoted saying that in 1978 he was within weeks of starting training as a Southwest Airlines pilot when a heavy rain prompted him to knuckle down. \u201cI just made the decision that this is where I need to be,\u201d Perry said.\n\n"}

The blog was headlined \"Clinton\u2019s VP pick Kaine: Promoting jihadis in America in exchange for cash.\"\nThe blog names Esam S. Omeish, a Fairfax County surgeon and Muslim activist, as the jihadi with whom Kaine had a \"quid pro quo\" relationship.\nOmeish, born in Libya, has lived in Virginia since 1982 and is a U.S. citizen. He\u2019s been chief of the division of general surgery at Inova Alexandria Hospital since 2006.\nIn August 2007, Kaine, then governor, appointed Omeish and nine others to the Virginia Commission on Immigration, a new panel that was set up to advise Kaine on state immigration policies.\nA month later, Kaine was on a radio show when a caller complained about Omeish\u2019s appointment, saying the surgeon had made controversial statements about jihad and Israel. Kaine said he was unaware of the statements and would look into them. Later that day, Kaine announced that Omeish had resigned from the commission at his urging.\nNewspapers reported then that the controversy sprang from internet-posted speeches Omeish had given as president of the Muslim American Society, a nonprofit set up to promote charitable, religious and educational causes.\nIn December 2000, Omeish spoke at a rally across the street from the White House protesting Israel\u2019s occupation of Jerusalem. He told the crowd, \"... you have learned the way and you have known that jihad is the way to liberate your land.\"\nAt an August 2006 rally in Washington, when Israel was fighting a border war with Lebanon, Omeish criticized the \"Israeli war machine.\" He called the Israeli action \"criminal\" and accused the nation of \"massacre and genocide against the Palestinian people.\" Omeish called on people \"not to allow an Israeli agenda that controls our Congress and holds us hostage.\"\nThe day after Kaine ousted him from the commission in 2007, Omeish held a news conference. He said his call for jihad came before the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center and, in using the term, was referring the concept of Islamic struggle rather than a holy war. Omeish said the word \"jihad\" can be misunderstood in a post 9/11 environment.\nThe Merriam-Webster dictionary says the full definition of \"jihad\" is \"a holy war based on behalf of Islam as a religious duty; also: a personal struggle in devotion to Islam especially involving spiritual discipline.\" \u00a0\nAs for Israel, Omeish said he favored a two-state government in the city with Israel and Palestine.\n\"It is not a call for violence. We never condone terrorists,\" Omeish said of his speeches.\nKaine, in a prepared statement announcing Omeish\u2019s resignation, praised him as a \"respected physician and community leader.\"\nA spokesman for Kaine said then that the governor was concerned Omeish\u2019s controversial comments would \"distract\" the commission\u2019s work.

(Ohio Gov. John Kasich got three.) This means that it is impossible for Cruz to secure the 1,237 delegates needed for the nomination on the first ballot, according to Trump.\n\"Ted Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race,\" he tweeted April 20. \"Now all he can do is be a spoiler, never a nice thing to do. I will beat Hillary!\"\nDoes Trump\u2019s math stack up?\nThe answer is more complicated than you\u2019d expect. It boils down to how you interpret some state rules and whether or not you count unbound delegates.\nWe explained the delegate process in-depth here, but here\u2019s a brief overview. To win the Republican nomination, a candidate has to clinch the support of a majority of 2,472 delegates. Most, but not all, are obligated to vote for the candidate who won their congressional district\u2019s or state\u2019s nominating contest.\nBut if no one gets to the 1,237 threshold on a first vote, many delegates are \"released\" to vote for whomever they want on second and third ballots. So Cruz (or Kasich or really anyone) does have a path forward in this sense. But Trump\u2019s statement is about that first ballot.\nSo far, 41 states and territories with a total of 1,798 delegates have already held primary or state conventions. Fifteen contests with 674 delegates are still up for grabs.\nWe looked at estimates for how many delegates Cruz has won from major outlets like the Associated Press, the New York Times and 538.com (Fox News uses the AP\u2019s counter) and two popular blogs that track delegate math.\nThe figures reported range from 542 \"hard\" delegates (meaning they\u2019re bound to Cruz on the first ballot) to 559 \"soft\" delegates (including those who aren\u2019t bound but have said they\u2019d vote for him).\nThis means that Cruz would need at the very least 678 more to get the nomination, so 100 percent of the remaining delegates plus four more. And if we don\u2019t count the unbound delegates from Pennsylvania (54) and West Virginia (three), he\u2019d need 110\u00a0percent of the remaining bound delegates.\n\n"}

I think I was ahead by eight points. No one else was ahead of him.\"\n\nRomney the only GOP presidential powerhouse in the Lone Star state?\n\nAn online search led us to the results of a poll taken in late June by North Carolina-based Public Policy Polling, which works with Democrats. The poll of 795 Texas voters, taken June 25-27, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Forty-four percent of the respondents identified themselves as Republicans, 35 percent as Democrats, 21 percent as Independents.\n\nAnd according to the poll, 50 percent of respondents favored Romney over Obama, who was backed by 42 percent -- indeed an eight-point edge. Summarizing, the pollster said Obama \"performs weakest\" against Romney.\n\nContrary to Romney\u2019s August recap, though, other Republicans also outperformed Obama.\n\nU.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, led Obama by 45 percent to 40 percent; U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann led Obama by 47 percent to 44 percent and former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty narrowly bested Obama by 44 percent to 43 percent.\n\nAccording to the poll, Obama was tied with Republican Herman Cain, at 43 percent, and led Sarah Palin by 46 percent to 44 percent. Perry, who had recently acknowledged he would weigh a bid for president, trailed Obama 47 percent to 45 percent.\n\nIn a press release accompanying the poll results, the polling firm said Bachmann was the most popular Republican contender in her own right and the only one in positive territory with a 39 percent to 36 percent favorable/unfavorable rating.\n\nRomney was viewed unfavorably by 43 percent of respondents, favorably by 37 percent. Perry, governor since late 2000, was approved by 43 percent of respondents but disapproved of by 52 percent -- though 52 percent of Republican respondents wanted him to run for president.\n\nSome 85 percent of respondents who voted for Republican nominee John McCain in 2008 preferred Romney to Obama; 78 percent preferred Perry to Obama.\n\nIn an interview, the polling firm\u2019s director, Tom Jennings, credited Romney with accurately reflecting his lead over Obama in the poll and that he fared better than other Republicans.\n\nWhile three other Republicans likewise bested Obama in the poll\u2019s one-on-one hypothetical matchups, Jennings said, Romney was the sole Republican whose lead outpaced its margin of error. \"He could argue he was the only one ahead outside the margin of error,\" Jennings said.\n\nRomney spokesman Ryan Williams echoed Jennings\u2019 point about Romney being the only Republican whose lead over Obama in the June poll exceeds the poll\u2019s margin of error. Williams said too that Romney, responding to a town-hall question about his appeal in the South, meant to point out he was the strongest Republican--not necessarily the only potentially winning Republican--against Obama, according to the poll.\n\nFinally, we came up empty on other polls matching Obama against individual Republican aspirants in Texas.\n\nHowever, a poll taken May 24-31 for the non-partisan Texas Lyceum, a statewide leadership group, gauged favorable/unfavorable ratings of candidates. Among the survey\u2019s likely voters, 22 percent of 147 respondents planning to vote in the 2012 Republican presidential primary said they had not thought enough about the race to make a choice. Of those who had a preference, Romney was favored by 16 percent, Palin by 14 percent, Paul by 10 percent, Perry by 9 percent, Cain by 8 percent and Pawlenty by 7 percent. The margin of error on these choices was plus or minus 8 percentage points, \"indicating that there is no clear favorite,\" the group said.\n\nAnother poll, taken May 11-18 by the University of Texas and the Texas Tribune, showed 12 percent of polled Republicans preferring Palin for president, 7 percent for Romney, 10 percent for Paul and 4 percent for Perry. Some 14 percent said they did not know who they would vote for if the presidential primary were held then.\n\nMore significantly eight months out from the Texas primary, the UT poll\u2019s results reaffirmed the state\u2019s Republican lean. Asked how they'd vote in a general election for president, 30 percent of polled voters said they would vote to re-elect Obama, while 48 percent said they\u2019d vote for the Republican nominee, whoever it is. Jim Henson, the poll\u2019s director, told us in an interview that barring unforeseen circumstances, any Republican is likely to best Obama in Texas.\n\nIn the June poll, all told, Romney performed better in Texas than other Republicans against Obama, but contrary to his statement, he was not the only Republican to best him. He was the only candidate who did so by more than the poll's margin of error.\n\nBut Romney is hardly the only Republican who could win the state.

{"label": "true", "claim": "Scott Walker Wisconsin is called the Badger State because \"our ancestors came here with the hopes of living the American dream by mining.\"", "evidence": "Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker wants to make it easier for a proposed iron ore mine, said to be worth more than $1 billion and packing potentially thousands of jobs, to win state approval.\n\nThe Republican governor, who made creating 250,000 private-sector jobs his signature campaign promise, mostly touts expected economic benefits. But, pointing to symbols on the state flag, he also argues that mining is central to Wisconsin\u2019s history.\n\nIn a Feb. 23, 2012 interview on WTMJ-AM (620) in Milwaukee, Walker expressed hope that the Legislature would pass a bill to \"streamline\" the mine approval process. Then he made a claim about the state animal that might surprise some of us in Wisconsin who weren\u2019t paying attention in school.\n\n\"If there's any state in America that should be able to\" adopt a mining bill that balances job creation and environmental safety, \"it should be the Badger State,\" Walker said.\n\n\"Because we're called the Badgers not because the animals are abundant here, but because we got nicknamed the Badgers because, back before we were a state, our ancestors came here with the hopes of living the American dream by mining. We should be able to do it again here in Wisconsin in 2012 and beyond.\"\n\nTo be sure, the main issues involving the proposed mine are money and the environment. We found to be Mostly True a claim that the mine proposed for near Hurley in far northern Wisconsin could generate billions of dollars of economic activity over 100 years.\n\nMeanwhile, one Wisconsin conservation organization has said a mining bill pending in the Legislature would allow groundwater to be polluted and \"our most sensitive wetlands to be filled in with mining waste.\"\n\nBut given the governor\u2019s new tack on promoting mining, we wondered whether Wisconsin, known more for brewing, milking and sausage making, got its Badgers nickname because of mining.\n\nWisconsin mining origins\n\nWalker spokesman Cullen Werwie pointed us to a Wisconsin Historical Society article that explains the importance of mining in the state\u2019s history.\n\nIt said in part:\n\n\"In the early nineteenth century, Wisconsin lead mining was more promising and attractive to potential settlers than either the fur trade or farming. Its potentially quick rewards lured a steady stream of settlers up the Mississippi River and into Grant, Crawford, Iowa, and Lafayette counties in the early nineteenth century. By 1829, more than 4,000 miners worked in southwestern Wisconsin, producing 13 million pounds of lead a year.\"\n\nAs for mining\u2019s connection to the badger, Werwie cited the state symbols section of the 2011-2012 Wisconsin Blue Book. It says that images on the state flag include a \"yeoman (usually considered a miner) with a pick,\" a mining pick and shovel, and \u00a013 lead ingots that represent \"mineral wealth,\" as well as a badger.\n\nThe Blue Book continues:\n\n\"History, rather than the law, explains Wisconsin\u2019s unofficial nickname as the \u2018Badger State.\u2019 During the lead-mining boom that began just prior to 1830 in southwestern Wisconsin, the name was first applied to miners who were too busy digging the \u2018gray gold\u2019 to build houses. Like badgers, they moved into abandoned mine shafts and makeshift burrows for shelter. Although \u2018badgers\u2019 had a somewhat derogatory connotation at first, it gradually gained acceptance as an apt description of the hardworking and energetic settlers of the Wisconsin Territory.\"\n\nThe state historical society and the Blue Book are as solid as lead as sources on state history.\n\nWe also found similar accounts about the connection between mining and the badger nickname in the historical society\u2019s \"Dictionary of Wisconsin History\" and in a 1918 Milwaukee Sentinel article.\n\nFew miners \u2018badgers\u2019?\n\nBut an article from the winter 1992-1993 edition of the historical society\u2019s Wisconsin Magazine of History raised questions.\n\nThen-Marquette University history professor Karel Bicha wrote that proving the conventional wisdom about mining and the badger nickname \"leads the investigator along an evidentiary pipeline which is ludicrously tenuous.\" That\u2019s because the traditional understanding, he said, \"derives largely from \u2018tradition\u2019 rather than verifiable \u2018history.\u2019\"\n\n\"Tradition aside,\" Bicha continued, \"it is legitimate to wonder whether there were ever, in reality, any cave- or dugout-dwelling miners. If so, who first observed them in their natural or man-made hillside orifices and divined the inelegant nickname \u2018badgers\u2019 to refer to them?\"\n\nHe goes on to say there is plenty of evidence of large numbers of miners living in cabins and other dwellings, but little evidence that more than a small number lived as \"badgers,\" or that they stayed in their caves or dugouts for very long.\n\nNevertheless, Bicha concludes:\n\n\"Realistically, the importance of the sobriquet \u2018badgers\u2019 lies not in its origin but in its diffusion. The diffusion of the term undoubtedly occurred by the same rapid and undocumentable process of oral transmission characteristic of slang, argot and jokes.\n\n\"Within two decades of its creation the expression had become divested of its specific association with both miners and the lead region. By the mid-1840s it made no difference whether the badger tradition was rooted in past reality or possessed no more inherent substance than the legend of William Tell. It was synonymous with Wisconsin and its people -- all of its people.\"\n\n"}

They are: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.\nMcClintock said Trump is rightly taking time to create a new vetting system because, as he put it, Obama\u2019s was \"very haphazard.\"\nGiven the ongoing immigration debate, we decided to fact-check McClintock\u2019s statement.\nBefore we start, here\u2019s some background on refugees:\nThe federal government defines a refugee as any person outside of the U.S. that is of special humanitarian concern to the U.S. and \"has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,\" according to the Pew Research Center.\nTrump\u2019s executive action affects many categories of immigrants from students to employees to refugees.\nRefugees, notably, have not been the primary perpetrators of any of the country\u2019s major terror attacks that killed Americans in recent decades. Trump has said his order was necessary to ensure national security.\nOur research\nWhen asked about McClintock\u2019s claim, Jennifer Cressy, a spokeswoman for the congressman said he was referring to testimony Congress received in 2015 from federal law enforcement that \"the vetting process hinges on the word of the applicant due to lack of reliable documentary proof of identity.\"\nThat testimony focused on Syrian refugees, which have accounted for a small but growing share of refugees admitted to the country.\nAs our national partner PolitiFact has reported, there are undoubtedly challenges to vetting refugees. No system is foolproof.\nThe head of the National Counterterrorism Center told Congress in October 2015 that the intelligence in Syria is \"not as rich as we would like it to be,\" while FBI Director James Comey told Congress that there are \"gaps\" in data availability.\nThe lack of U.S. relationships with Syrian government and law enforcement and the use of fake passports and fraudulent documents are also causes for concern, Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, told PolitiFact in November 2015. CIS advocates for limited immigration.\nThere are examples of refugees accepted under Obama who joined, or attempted to join, terror networks in the Middle East after arriving in the United States. Cressy, McClintock\u2019s spokeswoman, pointed to Aws Mohammed Younis Al-Jayab, a refugee who after arriving in the U.S. traveled to Syria to fight for the Nusra Front, and then returned to settle in Sacramento. He is awaiting trial on terrorism charges.\nThere are no examples, however, of any refugee committing fatal terror attacks on U.S. soil since the 1970s. More than three million refugees have arrived in the country since that time, making the odds of an American falling victim to a refugee in a terror attack miniscule, as PolitiFact California recently examined.\nMcClintock\u2019s claims about \"very haphazard vetting\" and that \"we simply accepted the word of applicants\" are overly broad and do not match up with how refugee screenings work.\nRefugee advocate responds\nKaren Ferguson is executive director of the Northern California International Rescue Committee, which helps resettle refugees in the United States.

{"label": "true", "claim": "Saxby Chambliss The fastest-rising expense in the U.S. Defense Department is health care.", "evidence": "U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss has been going around the Atlanta region in recent weeks talking about the dangerous consequences of the federal government\u2019s inability to rein in spending.\n\nOne area of spending that has the Georgia Republican concerned is the U.S. Defense Department\u2019s health care budget. We thought one claim by the senator was a case for the Truth-O-Meter.\n\nIn an April 11 speech to the Marietta Rotary Club, The Marietta Daily Journal paraphrased Chambliss as saying health care costs are the fastest-rising expense in the Defense Department.\n\n\"If we\u2019re not careful, it\u2019s going to consume our ability to buy weapons systems and to pay our men and women at the rate we need to pay them,\" Chambliss told the crowd in Marietta.\n\nChambliss, who serves on the Senate\u2019s Armed Services Committee, made a similar point in an April 23 speech at the Atlanta Press Club.\n\n\"If I went around this room to every company represented here and I asked you what is the fastest-rising expense in your business over the last decade, I dare say 100 percent of you would say it\u2019s health care costs,\" Chambliss said. \"And it\u2019s exactly that way in the federal government, including TRICARE in the Department of Defense, which is taking away our ability to spend money on other quality-of-life issues and identify weapons systems to equip our men and women.\"\n\nTRICARE is the program that provides health care to active-duty service members.\n\nSince defense is such an important part of the duties of the federal government, PolitiFact Georgia decided to examine whether the senator was correct.\n\nBronwyn Lance Chester, a spokeswoman for Chambliss, sent us several newspaper articles and other documents to back up the senator\u2019s claim. She did not specify the time period to which Chambliss was referring. That left us to our own interpretation.\n\nThe Military Health System budget, which pays for care for nearly 10 million military members, their families, retirees, dependent survivors and some others, nearly tripled over the past decade, Defense Department officials say in their budget overview, released in February. According to the overview, spending rose from $19 billion in fiscal year 2001 to the 2012 fiscal year total of about $53 billion. That $53 billion total does not include health care costs for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThe federal budget year begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30. We\u2019re currently in fiscal year 2012.\n\nMultiple news accounts quote former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and other military officials as saying health care is the fastest-growing cost of the department budget. We saw nothing in that report that shows a larger increase in any department.\n\nPolitiFact Georgia also looked at the latest Defense Department budget, which was completed in March. Lance Chester referred us to Table 5-5 of the budget, known as the Green Book, which has a breakdown of spending in several categories dating back to 1970 and projected through fiscal year 2017, which would begin Oct. 1, 2016.\n\nWe began by looking at the last five years. Here, the numbers were higher than what we saw in the February report. The current fiscal year spending under the health category was $100 billion. In fiscal year 2008, it was $82.74 billion. By our calculations, that was nearly a 21 percent increase over that five-year time span. That was the largest increase we saw. The second-highest increase was in fuel, which rose by 19.6 percent.\n\nIn fiscal year 2017, the health portion of the Defense Department budget is projected to be $114.24 billion. Other medical costs rose by a similar percentage.\n\nMaya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an organization of former federal budget officials, members of Congress and experts, is frustrated with politicians of all stripes in Washington for their failure to manage taxpayer money. We asked her if Chambliss is correct about this claim.\n\n\"It\u2019s true,\" said MacGuineas, who describes herself as a political independent.\n\nDefense officials are proposing to cut health care costs by increasing health care fees, copays and deductibles for retirees.\n\nAny way you slice the numbers, it appears the senator\u2019s claim is based on some solid numbers. Health care spending was the fastest-rising cost over the most recent five years, Defense Department figures show. It is also projected to be the fastest-rising cost over the next five years"}

Gov. Dan Patrick said in a nationally broadcast interview that Planned Parenthood does little more than profit from killing babies.\nPatrick, a Republican, appeared Oct. 19, 2015, on \"Your World with Neil Cavuto,\" a Fox News program. That was the day a Texas state official moved to cut off $3.1 million in annual Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood, 90 percent of it federal aid, for contraception and health services. That came as a result, the official said, of videos showing doctors for the group altered abortion procedures to procure intact fetal tissue for researchers in violation of federal law. Planned Parenthood, denying misconduct, commented that it was considering its options, including a lawsuit.\nPatrick, talking to Cavuto, said: \"We\u2019re not going to tolerate Planned Parenthood pretending, Neil, to be something they\u2019re not...\"\nCavuto: \"Do you think that Planned Parenthood does anything good?\"\nPatrick: \"No. I don\u2019t think they do anything good. Look, they\u2019re nothing more than a referral service. They pretend to care about women\u2019s health. But they don\u2019t have professionals even giving any information to women except referring them to another clinic. They don\u2019t \u00a0have equipment. They don\u2019t do anything except profit from killing babies and then selling body parts of those aborted babies.\"\nCavuto: \"Well, I understand your passions, sir. But they do a little bit more than that.\"\nPatrick: \"Very little.\"\nThere\u2019s been debate about what the videos taken with hidden cameras by the Center for Medical Progress, an anti-abortion group, show about sales of fetal tissue. But on Oct. 7, 2015, PolitiFact Florida rated False a claim that Planned Parenthood has \"now (been) found to also illegally sell baby parts.\" Federal law permits fetal tissue donations to researchers. Abortion providers also are allowed to charge a fee for facilitating such donations.\nWe focused our sights on whether Patrick is right that Planned Parenthood solely provides abortions.\nTo our request for backup information, Patrick\u2019s spokesman, Alejandro Garcia, said by phone: \"We don\u2019t have anything further to add.\"\nPast fact checks\nIn August 2015, PolitiFact rated Pants on Fire a claim by Jeb Bush that Planned Parenthood \"is not actually doing women\u2019s health issues.\" That story said Planned Parenthood \"offers contraception, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, pregnancy testing, prenatal services and cancer screenings, including breast exams,\" though not mammograms. In September 2012, PolitiFact Georgia rated True a claim that Planned Parenthood \"does not provide mammograms. Planned Parenthood refers women to mammography providers.\"\nEarlier, in April 2011, PolitiFact rated False a claim that abortion services are \"well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does.\" That story, citing a Planned Parenthood \"fact sheet,\" concluded that abortions accounted for just under 3 percent of the procedures Planned Parenthood provided in 2009, then the most recent year for which the group was reporting statistics.\nThere is lately more up-to-date information. On Planned Parenthood\u2019s website, we spotted a \"By the Numbers\" document last updated in July 2015 stating that 34 percent of its health services are contraceptive services and 3 percent are abortions.\nAnother document, \"Services,\" states that in 2013, Planned Parenthood provided more than 4.4 million services related to testing men and women for sexually transmitted infections or diseases; more than 3.5 million contraception services; more than 935,000 services related to cancer prevention and detection; some 1.1 million pregnancy and prenatal services; 327,653 abortions; and nearly 132,000 other services.\nThe most prevalent listed contraception service was \"reversible contraception\" for women (2.1 million services). The most common cancer screening was \"breast exams/breast care\" (487,029 services). That story said that a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman said doctors and nurses at Planned Parenthood health centers provide clinical breast exams and refer patients to facilities with technicians for mammograms based on breast exams, age or family history; she said Planned Parenthood also refers women to breast specialists when a potential abnormality is found and follow-up tests are needed.\n\n"}
{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Donald Trump \"Under Operation Warp Speed, we\u2019ve pioneered groundbreaking therapies, reducing the fatality rate 85% since April.\u201d", "evidence": "Seeking to counter the notion that the United States has failed to make progress against the\u00a0 novel coronavirus, President Donald Trump offered a positive statistic during a Sep. 7 news conference.\n\"Under Operation Warp Speed, we\u2019ve pioneered groundbreaking therapies, reducing the fatality rate 85 percent since April,\" Trump said. \"You don\u2019t hear that from the press very often.\u00a0 They don\u2019t like to talk about that. So the fatality rate, 85% \u2014 think of that \u2014 since April.\"\nWhen we asked the White House for supporting evidence, they provided the following chart, which they said was compiled by Stanford University School of Medicine professor Jay Bhattacharya. The time frame is somewhat different from what Trump cited, but the trend line is roughly the same.\n\nThe chart shows the case-fatality rate for coronavirus between mid-March and mid-July. That statistic refers to the number of coronavirus deaths divided by the number of known coronavirus cases \u2014 effectively, the likelihood that you will die from coronavirus if you are known to have been infected. (The data adjusts for the typical lag time between infection and death by pairing the infection data with the death data from two weeks later.)\nAccording to the White House\u2019s chart, close to one-third of people who were infected in mid-March ended up dying from the virus. By late April, that rate had fallen to 5%. That\u2019s roughly an 85% decline. (The statistic does not take into account specific risk factors for the disease that an individual may have, and instead looks at the population as a whole. So a person with risk factors may have a greater likelihood of dying, while one without risk factors would have a smaller likelihood.)\nBhattacharya told PolitiFact that the chart shows \"a very sharp drop in the case fatality rate from COVID-19 infection in the U.S. since the beginning of the epidemic \u2014 people are more likely to survive after infection than they were. It seems very important to me for the public to understand that the lethality of the infection is not what it was when impressions first formed in March. The experience of the Northeast with the epidemic in those early days is atypical of the experience of people infected now.\"\nHowever, Trump\u2019s focus on this one data point also needs some additional context. The reasons for the drop are not entirely from improved therapies, and Operation Warp Speed, the administration\u2019s effort to devise countermeasures against the virus, doesn\u2019t necessarily get the credit for the drop.\nWhy did the case fatality rate fall?\nPart of the decline likely stems from reasons other than better treatments, said Tara C. Smith, a professor of Epidemiology at Kent State University\u2019s College of Public Health.\nOne factor is testing. Early on, due in part to shortages in testing equipment, only individuals with significant symptoms were being tested, and those patients would be likelier to end up with a fatal case. Later on, Smith said, testing was catching more individuals with mild symptoms or even no symptoms at all, which helped decrease the case-fatality rate.\nTo make this concrete, in March 19, as the case-fatality rate was peaking, 27,974 tests were taken nationally, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. By April 27, the number was 196,080 \u2014 a seven-fold increase. By then, the case-fatality rate had fallen significantly. The rate fell further by July 22, when the number of tests had risen to 796,439.\n\"Since the denominator of case-fatality is the number of cases detected, the availability of testing and testing practices is a huge driver of the case fatality,\" said Brooke Nichols, an infectious disease mathematical modeler at the Boston University School of Public Health.\nIt is worth noting that the Trump administration has touted its role in expanded testing. But had the same level of testing been in place earlier in the epidemic, the figures on this chart may not have shown the same level of fatality rate decline.\nIn addition, the coronavirus was especially deadly to residents in nursing homes early in the pandemic. That coincided with the period of when testing was limited, probably exaggerating the case-fatality rate. Later in the pandemic, nursing homes implemented stronger protections.\n\n"}

Each side put their own political spin on the news.\n\n\"Fox News Sunday\" host John Roberts hashed over the subject two days later with the chairs of the Republican and Democratic national committees. DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a congresswoman from Florida, \u00a0accentuated its positive aspects while repeatedly alluding to likely GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s 2008 advice that the auto industry in Detroit should be permitted to go bankrupt.\n\n\"In Ohio,\" Wasserman Schultz noted, \"80 out of 82 counties in Ohio actually have an auto manufacturing facility. So, if it was left to Mitt Romney, they essentially would have all gone out of business because he would have left those folks twisting in the wind.\"\n\nIt\u2019s widely recognized that the auto industry is a main driver of Ohio\u2019s economy. But PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out Wasserman Schultz\u2019s statistics.\n\nTo begin with, Ohio has 88 counties, not 82. The Democratic National Committee\u2019s press office did not respond to PolitiFact Ohio\u2019s request for background on her comments, although her claim that 80 of the state\u2019s counties contain auto manufacturing facilities is echoed in a March 2012 report from Obama\u2019s re-election campaign (which got the number of Ohio\u2019s counties right).\n\n\"Auto jobs are spread across the state,\" the Obama campaign statement says: \"80 out of 88 counties have at least one auto industry establishment.\"\n\nThe Obama campaign document cites a statistic from a February 2011 Ohio Department of Development report, which says motor vehicles are produced in 80 of Ohio\u2019s counties.\n\n\"The production of motor vehicles, bodies, trailers and parts is diffused across the state - 80 counties have at least one industry establishment,\" that report says. \"One half the jobs were located in 10 counties: Cuyahoga, Hancock, Logan, Lorain, Lucas, Montgomery, Richland, Shelby, Trumbull and Union counties.\"\n\nBut a June 2012 snapshot of Ohio\u2019s motor vehicle industry produced by the same agency estimates that at least 12 of Ohio\u2019s 88 counties have no motor vehicle industry employees: Adams, Athens, Coshocton, Guernsey, Harrison, Hocking, Jackson, Lawrence, Meigs, Monroe, Muskingum and Vinton counties. That would put motor vehicle industry workers in 76 of Ohio\u2019s 88 counties.\n\nOhio Department of Development spokeswoman Stephanie Mennecke told PolitiFact Ohio that the newer document used a more limited definition of the motor vehicle industry than the older report and that could help explain the change. For example, she said the newer report categorizes jobs produced by a Daimler diesel engine remanufacturing plant in Guernsey County are under a code for machinery workers, not motor vehicle industry workers.\n\nIt excluded categories like tire manufacturing, tire retreading, and the manufacture of storage batteries that the previous report included in its \"motor vehicle industry\" classification.\n\nMennecke said that different organizations use different definitions for \"auto industry\" when they produce their statistics, so it can be hard to compare numbers produced by different groups.\n\nWasserman Schultz\u2019s claim referred specifically to auto manufacturing. The 80 county statistic from the Ohio Department of Development\u2019s 2011 report referred to \"motor vehicle industry\" workers. The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics lumps all other motor vehicle makers \u00a0into the \u00a0automobile category when it tabulates its auto industry employment statistics. Even the Ohio Department of Development varies its definition of \"motor vehicle industry\" in the different reports it produces.\n\nWasserman Schultz\u2019s claim -- 80 of 82 counties in Ohio have an auto manufacturing facility -- is generally accurate.\n\nWhile she misstated the total number of counties in the state, she got right the number of counties that have at least one business related to production of motor vehicles, bodies, trailers and parts. \u00a0A report from the Ohio Department of Development backs that figure.\n\nA more current report from the Department of Development sets that figure at 76 of Ohio\u2019s 88 counties. But an expert told PolitiFact Ohio that changes in how the industry group is defined could be part of the reason for that change.\n\nThat\u2019s additional information that provides clarification"}

Take George Soros. The name of the Hungarian-born philanthropist, hedge fund manager and major liberal donor stands for things to some in the Republican Party, namely, ultra-liberal ideals and a willingness to spend millions of dollars to back them.\nThat quickly brings us to an ad from the National Republican Congressional Committee, which wants a GOP candidate, Jim Hagedorn, to win an open seat in Minnesota\u2019s 1st Congressional District. Thus, the NRCC ad, one of two made in quick succession with similar themes, seeks to tie the Democratic candidate in the race, Dan Feehan, to Soros.\nWe at PolitiFact deal with claims made through words, so we will not be ruling on the ad\u2019s visual that show cartoonish mounds of money piled in front of the billionaire -- and Colin Kaepernick, the protesting former quarterback, right next to Soros, with masked mobs in front of him.

Even if he were, it would be fairer to say that a major defense contractor and the United States government are bigger current funders of the think tank than Soros -- and President Donald Trump\u2019s defense secretary used to serve on the board and very much likes the center\u2019s work.\nFeehan\u2019s job\nFeehan is a combat veteran of the Iraq war, a former teacher and a former acting assistant secretary of defense in the Obama administration. He does research and writing as an adjunct senior fellow for the Center for a New American Security. The center told us this means he contributes to research and gets paid on a per-project basis, and his compensation suggests as much: As of Aug. 13, his candidate\u2019s financial disclosure listed $55,412 in income from \"research/writing\" for the center this year and $7,916 from last year.\nSome full-time senior fellows at the center, in contrast, were making as much as $172,000 to $197,000 in 2016, forms filed with the IRS show.\nThe think tank has been characterized as liberal because of its founding by two Democratic foreign policy experts. But in an article for Vox, it was also described as rather centrist, representing \"the old George H.W. Bush view on foreign policy; some people would say it\u2019s the Hillary Clinton view \u2014 it\u2019s just where the US government has been for a very long time.\" The Los Angeles Times in 2013 called the center \"respected\" and \"a haven for hawkish Democrats.\"\nThe Center for a New American Security has a fan in James Mattis, Trump\u2019s defense secretary. Mattis was on the center\u2019s board before going back into service for the government.

That\u2019s a much smaller figure: Deer hunting licenses and permits generated $22.7 million in revenue for the DNR in 2010, the latest year available.\nVos spokeswoman Kit Beyer told us he meant the broader impact on the economy of hunting-related spending. That\u2019s how we read it, too. The same number was referred to by Gov. Scott Walker and others in their own pre-hunt statements.\nWalker\u2019s news release cited the state Department of Natural Resources, which pointed to a 2006 study, \"Hunting in America,\" by the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies.\nThat 2006 study estimated direct spending by deer hunters at $899 million. That means money spent on gas for the pickup truck, food and beverages, firearms, ammo, lodging and other essentials, say, a new trailer, a gun case, land access fees, etc.\nThe figure, gleaned from a large national survey conducted by the US Census Bureau, reflects that direct spending by hunters. But the study also estimates the \"ripple effect\" of their spending on the broader economy. That\u2019s the $1.39 billion, cited by Vos and the others.\nThe study uses a pretty broad definition of ripple effect.\nIt quantifies such indirect spending \"as retailers buy more merchandise from wholesalers and manufacturers who then buy more input, plus the spending by the employees of all these companies,\" said Rob Southwick of Southwick Associates, which does the estimate. \"It is possible to divide and track retail sales as they move through the economy, with each successive round becoming smaller until it\u2019s no longer possible to measure.\"\nSo it\u2019s a much softer estimate than the direct spending. Such measures always are.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that $1.39 billion figure includes more than the just-concluded nine-day gun hunt mentioned by Vos. There\u2019s a separate bow-hunt season as well.\nIt\u2019s not possible to tease out exactly how much spending is for bow vs. gun, and there is some overlap. But based strictly on licenses for all kinds of deer hunting, 74 percent are for the gun season (615,000 licenses).\nApplying that ratio, the direct spending for the nine-day gun season would be $665 million, and about $1.03 billion for indirect.\n\n"}

In a table charting tax rates between 1979 and 2007, the CBO reported that the average effective income tax rate (that is, the percentage paid after deductions and credits) for the richest 1 percent of earners began at 21.8 percent in 1979, rose to as high as 24.2 percent in 1996 and 2000 and had dropped to 19 percent by 2007.\n\n(Conservatives note that even though the rates are dropping, upper-income Americans still account for the lion\u2019s share of the nation\u2019s income tax revenue. \"So while it is true that tax rates \u2026 are significantly lower than they were 30 years ago, the rich are paying a lot more of the overall tax burden,\" says Cato Institute economist Dan Mitchell. Federal figures show that the top 5 percent of taxpayers accounted for more than half of the income tax dollars paid.) \u00a0\n\nBut what about Geithner's final point: that the rate for the top 1 percent is \"lower than somebody who might make substantially less money\"?\n\nIn his talk, Geithner cited the example of super-investor Warren Buffett, who famously complained that the United States tax system is so upside-down that he paid a smaller share of his income to Uncle Sam than his secretary.\n\nSpeaking to wealthy donorsat a 2007 fundraiser for then-Sen. Hillary Clinton, Buffett said, \"The 400 of us (here) pay a lower part of our income in taxes than our receptionists do, or our cleaning ladies for that matter.\" Buffett said that he was taxed at 17.7 percent on the $46 million he had made the previous year, while his secretary faced a 30 percent federal tax bill on her $60,000 earnings.\n\nBuffett\u2019s case provides a powerful anecdote about the extremes of a tax system that hands breaks to a small group of wealthy people, particularly those who take much of their income in tax-favored capital gains and dividends. And Treasury statistics support the assertion that the super-duper rich \u2014 the 120,000 taxpayers who comprise the wealthiest 9/100ths of 1 percent of the tax-paying population \u2014 pay slightly lower income tax rates than people just below them on the income ladder.\n\nBut Geithner made a much broader assertion. He said the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers \u2014 about 1.4 million individuals or households \u2014 paid lower rates. And that isn't supported by the facts.\n\nWe began with a source provided by Geithner\u2019s office: the 2010 Economic Report of the President. On page 154, a chart tracks the history of effective tax rates for people making more than $250,000 a year and the middle 20 percent of taxpayers who make considerably less. While the tax rate for the rich has clearly dropped, the chart shows, it remains visibly higher than the middle group.\n\nThe CBO figures paint a more specific, and stark, contrast. In 2007 (the most recent year listed), the top 1 percent of earners paid 19 percent of their income in federal individual income taxes, and for people earning less, the rate went steadily down, to a rate of minus 6.8 percent for people in the lowest 20 percent of taxpayers. (Because of the Earned Income Tax Credit, many working class families pay no net taxes and, indeed, collect refunds from the government to help them make ends meet.)\n\nThe CBO chart covers only the federal individual income tax, which is the one Geithner was discussing. But even if you fold in other federal taxes (corporate, estate, Social Security and Medicare), average rates remain higher for the richest group than for everyone else. The non-partisan Urban-Brookings center folded in the other forms of federal taxes for 2011, and found that the top 1 percent will pay 27.6 percent, and that rates steadily decline for the less-wealthy until they reach zero (a little less, actually) for the lowest one-fifth of earners.\n\nWhile some of the very rich pay a lower rate than less wealthy Americans, said Eric Toder, the center\u2019s co-director, \"We do find that the average rates go up by income.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nGeithner was largely correct when he said the top 1 percent pay rates in the low 20s, a \u00a0tax burden that is historically low. But he's wrong that the wealthiest enjoy effective rates \"lower than somebody who might make substantially less money"}
{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Debbie Wasserman Schultz Republicans are now \"taking credit\" for provisions of the health care bill \"that they had tried to derail.\"", "evidence": "Whoa, talk about a change in tune. Are Republicans now trying to take credit for parts of the health care bill? Are the Yankees rooting for the Red Sox? Are dogs and cats getting along?\n\nIn an Aug. 12, 2010, op-ed for Politico headlined \"GOP touts preventive care it opposed,\" Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., and Rosa DeLauro , D-Conn., touted the benefits of preventive and wellness care. As survivors of breast and ovarian cancer, respectively, they said that preventive care saved their lives. But if Republicans have their way, the Democrats said, they would roll back a provision of the Affordable Care Act that requires no co-pay for preventive care \u2014 including cancer screenings, health checkups, flu shots, mammograms and immunizations.\n\nThat's pretty standard fare from Democratic supporters of the health care bill. But here's the part of the op-ed that caught our attention:\n\n\"Even Republicans who voted against the health care reform law and went out of their way to prevent its passage have now lauded these reforms. Recently, on the Senate floor, Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) actually took credit for the preventive care provision. 'One of the things we did in the health care legislation,' Kyl said, 'was to provide a lot of different incentives for preventive care.'\"\n\nAnd, they wrote, \"This is not the first time Republicans have taken credit for health care provisions that they had tried to derail. After the act passed, and every Republican attempt to gut the bill had failed, House Minority Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio) took credit for provisions that banned the practice of rescissions \u2014 dropping people\u2019s health coverage when they get sick \u2014 and allowed young adults to continue being covered by their parents\u2019 plans until age 26.\n\n\"To paraphrase President John F. Kennedy, success has a thousand fathers, while defeat is an orphan. So we understand why Republicans now like to laud health care reform \u2014 particularly when one considers that, after a decade of congressional control with eight years holding the White House as well, they had failed to do anything about the issue.\"\n\nThat Republicans are now lauding the health care bill was news to us. So we decided to check out the two examples cited in the op-ed.\n\nKyl's comments about preventive care came from the Senate floor on July 12, 2010. The topic was the White House's controversial recess appointment of Dr. Donald M. Berwick as Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\nHere's what Kyl said:\n\n\"Dr. Berwick expressed his disapproval for costly cutting-edge medical technologies and has said prevention services such as 'annual physicals, screening tests, and other measures' are 'over-demanded.' One of the things we did in the health care legislation was provide a lot of different incentives for preventive care, for screening, to try to help people avoid illnesses on the theory that it would be a lot cheaper if we didn\u2019t do a lot of treatment that was unnecessary. If you could identify in advance that an individual had a need for some treatment, maybe you could catch the disease, say, the cancer, early and not have the expensive treatment, the end-of-life kind of care that is frequently very expensive.\"\n\nKyl's new use of the royal \"we\" didn't quite mesh with his vocal opposition to the bill. In a health care debate last year -- that ended up a minor hit on YouTube -- Kyl argued against mandating blanket coverages.\n\n\"I don't need maternity care, and so requiring that to be in my insurance policy is something that I don't need and will make the policy more expensive,\" Kyl said.\n\nSo were Kyl's recent comments from the Senate floor an endorsement of the health care bill's preventive care provisions, and was he now taking credit for it?\n\n\"Sen. Kyl did not, in fact, 'take credit for' anything in his remark,\" said Andrew Wilder, a spokesman for Kyl. \"'We' was a factual reference to Congress, and did not contain a partisan context, as some now assert presumably for political reasons.\"\n\nStill, Democrats note that Kyl's tone appears to have changed, saying \"we\" instead of the more typical reference to the bill as \"the Democrat health care bill.\"\n\n\"The way he's talking about it, he's talking about it like it's a good thing,\" said Brian Cook, press secretary for Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., chair of the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee.\n\nWhether that amounts to taking credit for the idea is getting into a bit of semantics. Certainly Republicans -- and Kyl in particular -- have forcefully opposed the health care bill, and repeatedly spoken of it in terms that liken it to a disaster. And so we can understand Democrats' frustration when a strong opponent of the bill cites a provision of of the bill that \"we did\" -- especially in light of his earlier comments against requiring insurers to carry preventive services -- like maternity care -- that not everyone would use. But we think it's a bit of a stretch to suggest that Kyl was \"taking credit\" for that provision.\n\nThe \"taking credit\" moniker better fits the comments regarding Boehner.\n\nIn an April 30, 2010, interview with Boehner on National Public Radio, a reporter said, \"As you know, Democrats are already pointing to things that are already changing in America because of this (health care) bill. They will point to the fact that college seniors who would have been kicked off their parents' insurance when they graduated will get to stay on. Insurance companies are now saying they are going to end the practice of rescissions, or at least modify it...\"\n\nBoehner interjected, \"Both of those ideas, by the way, came from Republicans and are part of the comments and ideas that we ought to have in the law.\"\n\nMichael Steel, a spokesman for Boehner, noted that both provisions -- abolishing rescissions and encouraging extended coverage of young adults on their parents\u2019 insurance through age 25 -- were included in the Republican alternative health care plan proposed by Boehner last November.\n\nBut the ideas were in the Democrats' health plan long before that. And if they were Republican ideas, asked Cook, the Democratic spokesman for the Ways and Means committee, then why was it never a part of the Republicans' legislative agenda when they held the majority?\n\n\nWe weren't able to pinpoint who originated the ideas, but we can say these were two ideas with rare bipartisan support -- as they were both in the Democratic and Republican health care proposals. It's certainly true that Republicans aggressively fought the health care bill, and are now aggressively seeking to overturn it. But it is misleading to suggest Republicans tried to derail the health care bill based on these two provisions.\n\nSo are Wasserman Schultz and DeLauro correct that Republicans are now \"taking credit\" for provisions of the health care bill \"that they had tried to derail\"?\n\nIn the case of Kyl comments, we think it's a stretch to say he took credit for the preventive care provisions in the health care bill. But Boehner did credit Republicans for provisions to abolish rescissions and allow young adults to continue being covered by their parents\u2019 plans until age 26. Yet those specific provisions were not the target of the GOP opposition, which focused on larger issues of cost and the growth of government"}

{"label": "false", "claim": "Rick Scott Says Sen. Bill Nelson \"voted for higher taxes\" 349 times.", "evidence": "Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson is a big fan of tax increases, says his Republican rival U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV of Fort Myers.\n\n\"Bill Nelson voted for higher taxes 150 times, 150 times,\" Mack said during a debate at Nova Southeastern University in Davie Oct. 17. \"I voted to cut taxes \u2026 if you voted for higher taxes 150 times, it's time for you to go.\"\n\nLater in the debate Nelson said that Mack\u2019s claim was \"simply not true.\"\n\n\"Outside fact-check organizations have said it's not true,\" Nelson said. \"You haven\u2019t talked about all the tax cuts I voted for.\"\n\nMack repeated the claim again: \"Senator, your propensity to vote for higher taxes is shocking, absolutely shocking. Like I said, if you voted for higher taxes 150 times, it\u2019s time for you to go.\"\n\nWe fact-checked this claim by Mack in August and rated it False. We will summarize what we learned from our earlier research.\n\nDouble-counting votes and other tallying tricks\n\nMack\u2019s campaign sent us a list of what they characterized as at least 157 votes in favor of higher taxes during Nelson\u2019s Senate career, which started in 2001. (They sent us a similar list again the night of the debate.)\n\nAbout half of the votes on the list are Democratic budget resolutions, which set non-binding parameters for considering tax and spending legislation. So it's technically incorrect to say the budget resolution raised, lowered or even kept taxes the same. The documents cannot change tax law.\n\nMack\u2019s tally counts multiple votes on the same budget resolution. For example, Mack cites nine votes Nelson took in 2008 about Congressional Resolution 70, a five-year budget plan.\n\nMack also counted multiple votes on actual legislation. It\u2019s common for senators to take multiple votes as both parties engage in maneuvering and introduce competing amendments.\n\nFor example, in 2001 Mack counts 15 of Nelson\u2019s votes against H.R. 1836 -- the $1.35 trillion in tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush. That counts as one example of Nelson opposing tax cuts -- not 15 examples.\n\nWhich brings us to another point: Is opposing a tax cut the same as \"voting to raise our taxes?\" Mack\u2019s list counts several examples of Nelson opposing tax cuts. Some are minor, such as Nelson\u2019s vote to table an amendment to get rid of the medical device tax in 2010.\n\nWe sent Mack\u2019s list to a three federal budget experts, who \u00a0generally agreed that a vote against a new tax cut doesn\u2019t equal a tax increase.\n\nJoshua Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition, a group that urges deficit reduction, said Mack\u2019s long list was \"ludicrous.\"\n\n\"Voting to lessen the size of a tax cut in a budget resolution is not voting for a tax increase,\" he said. \"So, I would argue the methodology represents a crazy way to look at this issue.\"\n\n Nelson supported some tax cuts\n\nMack\u2019s statement omits that Nelson has sometimes voted in favor of tax cuts. Here, we will focus on the Bush tax cuts.\n\nNelson opposed a $1.35 trillion tax cut in 2001 because he said it didn\u2019t do enough to reduce debt or help low- and middle-income taxpayers. He also said that as a congressman he had voted for President Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1981 tax cuts and that led to huge deficits.\n\n\"I don't want to see Congress make that mistake again,\" Nelson said in 2001.\n\nIn 2003 on the second round of Bush tax cuts, Nelson voted against the $350 billion package on the conference report. But in 2006 and in 2010 Nelson, supported extending the tax cuts.\n\nThis year, he went along with Obama\u2019s plan and voted in July to keep tax cuts only for those earning less than $250,000, though he had said he would have preferred keeping the Bush-era tax cuts for those earning up to $1 million.\n\n\"His favored position, and one he still holds, is to let the Bush cuts expire on those making more than $1 million,\" said his Senate spokesman Dan McLaughlin.\n\nNelson called for other tax cuts at times. During his first Senate term he bucked his party in favor of repealing the estate tax and in 2007 he sponsored an amendment to reduce the tax on large cigars.\n\nSome of Nelson\u2019s votes cited by Mack would only affect certain businesses -- for example he voted in favor of repealing exemptions for oil and gas companies in 2010. He took many votes in favor of eliminating corporate tax breaks to pay for projects such as port security.\n\nMack\u2019s spokesman told us that the largest tax increase Nelson voted for was \"Obamacare.\" The health care law did raise taxes on the wealthy and health insurance companies. (Read about those provisions in a fact-check we did on a claim by Rush Limbaugh.)\n\nIn an interview on debate night, Mack campaign consultant Gary Maloney defended including the budget resolutions and said they are important because they bind congressional committees on their spending and build in assumptions of revenue, taxes and spending. \"A vote for a budget that assumes higher taxes is a vote that is designed to produce a revenue bill that will raise taxes,\" he said.\n\n Our ruling\n\nMack said, \"Bill Nelson voted for higher taxes 150 times.\"\n\nMack arrives at that figure through some tricks: He counts non-binding resolutions and duplicative votes on the same bill. He counts a vote against a tax cut as a vote for a tax increase, even though it\u2019s not the same thing. And Mack failed to tell debate viewers that Nelson has also voted in favor of tax cuts or extending tax cuts.\n\nIn the list of votes that Mack supplied to PolitiFact after the debate, he included a note that explained it included non-binding votes and other caveats. But during the debate, Mack didn\u2019t explain any of that -- he just repeated the claim without further explanation"}
{"label": "half-true", "claim": "SEIU \"You worked hard for your money and you paid your taxes when you earned it. Now, (Indiana Republican congressional candidate) Todd Young wants to tax it again when you spend it.\"", "evidence": "We've written before about a conservative proposal called the \"Fair Tax,\" which would eliminate the federal income tax, employment tax, and estate and gift taxes and replace them with a 23 percent national sales tax. Supporters say it would reduce the cost of compliance and close loopholes. Critics counter that it would be regressive and would actually require a higher rate than the advertised 23 percent.\n\nWhatever the truth of these claims, Democrats clearly consider it a winning issue: They've used the Fair Tax as the basis for many ads against Republicans this year, one of which we recently rated Half True.\n\nWe noticed the issue crop up once again in a close House contest between incumbent Democratic Rep. Baron Hill and Republican attorney Todd Young to represent a swing district in southern Indiana. Here's what caught our eye in an Oct. 20, 2010, ad placed by the political arm of the Service Employees International Union.\n\nThe ad says\u00a0Young, \"supports a 23 percent national sales tax on everything you buy -- food and clothing, even medicine. You worked hard for your money and you paid your taxes when you earned it. Now, Todd Young wants to tax it again when you spend it. Attacking Social Security and taxing seniors twice? Indiana can't afford Todd Young.\"\n\nLet's start by exploring the evidence that Young supports the Fair Tax, or something like it.\n\nThe issues page of Young's campaign website urges\u00a0Congress to \"immediately simplify our complicated tax code \u2014 and reward work, savings, and investment \u2014 by replacing the current code with either a consumption-based tax or a flatter tax.\" Democrats have also pointed to instances in which Young cited the Fair Tax by name, including in a North Vernon Republican debate on April 10, 2010.\n\nWhen we asked the Young campaign for his official position, they pointed us to an Oct. 21, 2010, article in the Jeffersonville News and Tribune in which Young said he is flexible on which tax system to use.\n\n\"Young said a better approach than the Fair Tax would be a system that would give options where people could choose to stay with what they\u2019re familiar with or go for a simpler tax code,\" the newspaper reported. \"Whatever tax reform proposal we move towards, I have to ensure in order to get my support that it doesn\u2019t involve raising taxes.\"\n\nStill, even if Young is backing off specific support for the Fair Tax, we do think there's enough evidence that he once supported it, or supported something very similar to it, to make it fair game for the SEIU.\n\nNow to the substance of the ad's charges.\n\nOne issue is the ad's reference to taxing \"food and clothing, even medicine.\" This statement is largely correct, but there's an important caveat. While the Fair Tax would indeed tax such items, it would also include a \"prebate\" -- an advance refund intended to cover the costs of such basic purposes. Still, the prebate would be a flat amount pegged to family size, and would not directly exempt purchases of food, clothing or medicine but would rather compensate families indirectly for a portion of the sales tax they pay. So we think the SEIU's wording is justified.\n\nBut the issue in the ad that most intrigued us is the notion of double taxation. After watching a variety of ads about the Fair Tax, we had yet to see one that explicitly called the Fair Tax double taxation. And that set off alarm bells for us, since the Fair Tax, whatever you think of it as a policy, is definitely not designed to be layered on top of the current tax code. It is explicitly designed to replace the current tax code.\n\nBoth PolitiFact and our friends at FactCheck.org have criticized ads that gloss over the notion that the Fair Tax would replace the current tax code. In a previous Truth-O-Meter item, we said that the absence of such context in an ad by Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., amounted to \"a very deceptive omission.\" But not even Lincoln's ad went so far as to say, pure and simple, that the 23 percent sales tax amounted to double taxation. So we approached this ad thinking it might earn a Pants on Fire.\n\nThen we checked with the SEIU. They acknowledged that the Fair Tax would be a replacement for the current tax system. But they made an interesting point -- that for seniors, the explicit target audience for the ad, there is something that you might call double taxation. For many years, seniors paid taxes on their income when they earned it. Whatever they didn't spend, they saved, and in their retirement years, when they aren't earning fresh income that would be tax-free under the Fair Tax, those accumulated savings would be spent -- and thus taxed at 23 percent. Voila -- double taxation.\n\nTo see whether this argument holds any water, we checked in with an ideological cross-section of economists. In general, they agreed that SEIU had a point.\n\nWhen we contacted Bruce Bartlett, a former official in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, he referred us to a 2007 article he wrote in the journal Tax Notes titled, \"Why the Fair Tax Won't Work.\" Bartlett said the proposal \"penalizes those who are older who have saved for their retirement during an era when saving was heavily penalized by the income tax. But rather than being able to spend their savings tax free, as they anticipated, they will now have to pay sales taxes on everything they buy, including health care. It will be hard for them to avoid seeing this as a double tax.\n\nBob Williams, a senior fellow with the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, agreed that the Fair Tax double-taxes savings. \"It's a transition issue that would disappear in time, once all savings held at the time of transition have been spent,\" Williams said. \"The ad is clearly aimed at seniors, for whom the issue is definitely valid.\" Williams added that seniors would also fail to get much of a benefit from the Fair Tax's elimination of income tax because \"most Social Security income is not subject to income tax.\"\n\nDan Mitchell, a tax policy specialist at the libertarian Cato Institute, criticized the ad for leaving out the notion that the Fair Tax would replace the income tax. But he acknowledged that \"there is potentially an element of truth to the secondary point about taxing seniors who earned money while young, paid income tax, saved some of the after-tax money, and now want to spend that money.\" Mitchell added that not all seniors would be affected equally -- it would more heavily affect seniors who had substantial savings outside of 401(k)s or other plans in which income is not taxed initially.\n\nSo where does this leave us? We think SEIU makes a legitimate point that seniors -- the group that is specifically singled out for mentions in the ad's narration and in its visuals -- would face what amounts to double taxation of their savings if the Fair Tax were to pass. But we're also wary of giving this a full True rating, because we think that most viewers watching the ad would assume that the 23 percent tax would be levied on top of the existing income tax (which, we'll point out, is referenced at one point by a visual of someone filling out an IRS Form 1040). And it's simply not part of the plan for Americans to be hit by both the current tax code and the Fair Tax simultaneously"}

They also would have exempted overseas moves from the types of relocation that can receive tax breaks.\nSo the claim itself has the facts of the bill basically right, although it leaves room for people to get the wrong impression.\n\n"}

He qualified the remark he made to his board, saying it\u2019s more relevant to compare RIPTA to transit systems that are comparably sized and in areas with a comparable cost of living than to simply look toward other systems in New England.\n\nIf you did look to Boston or New York for a comparison and took into consideration their higher cost of living, \"you will come to the conclusion that the rides in Rhode Island are very high,\" he said.\n\nWe\u2019re not sure why cost of living should be a factor, so we focused only on how much it costs to ride the bus.\n\nIn Rhode Island, the fare for riding a RIPTA bus is $2 one way. Need to transfer to another bus? That costs another 50 cents. Ride frequently? You can get a one-day pass for $6 and a monthly pass for $62. Some people, including seniors, disabled, low-income and students, can ride for free or for half price.\n\n[Of the 18.2 million rides RIPTA provided during the past 12 months, about 4.2 million, or one-quarter, were seniors and disabled people who hold free passes -- they number 40,000 -- and another 2 million were students with passes, according to assistant general manager Mark Therrien.]\n\nBy comparison, in Boston, the base bus fare is $1.50, or 25 cents less with a pre-paid Charlie Card. A monthly local pass costs $40.\n\nLet\u2019s look at some other transit systems in New England. In Portland, Maine, the fare is $1.50, with a monthly pass costing $45.\n\nThe Worcester Regional Transit Authority charges $1.50, with monthly passes going for $48. \u00a0In Burlington, Vt., the fare for a public bus is $1.25, with a monthly pass costing $42. Connecticut Transit, serving Hartford and New Haven among other communities, charges $1.25, with free transfers.\n\nRIPTA\u2019s internal survey draws a comparison with a handful of comparable, or \"peer\" systems outside of New England. Fares were reported from last summer, but we went to their individual websites and updated those that have changed. In cities such as Albany, Rochester, Memphis, and Louisville, basic fares were lower than RIPTA\u2019s.\n\nSo far, Odimgbe\u2019s claim seems to be holding up.\n\nBut comparing only base fares doesn\u2019t give a complete picture of what it costs to ride a bus in any of these systems. And this is where Odimgbe\u2019s claim begins to break down.\n\nIn Rhode Island, there\u2019s one basic fare, no matter how many miles you travel -- whether it\u2019s within Providence city limits or between outlying communities and the capital city. Get on a bus in Westerly and it will carry you the 43 miles to Providence, all for just $2. Get a transfer for another 50 cents and you could then head to Woonsocket, another 15 miles.\n\n[Odimgbe said the agency has concluded that because most RIPTA riders travel within urban areas -- an estimated 85 percent of rides within 7 miles of downtown Providence -- it would not be worth creating a system to charge long-distance riders more.]\n\nYou\u2019re not going to travel those long distances in Connecticut that cheaply. \u00a0Express bus service between Hartford and outlying areas is based on zone fares that range from from $2.25 to $4.30.\n\nFor example, if you board a bus in Old Saybrook or New Haven and travel the 40-plus miles to Hartford, the fare is $4.30, more than double Rhode Island\u2019s fare for a comparable distance.\n\nBoston, meanwhile, has higher fares for its Inner Express ($3.50) and Outer Express ($5) services.\n\nLet\u2019s make one last stop before we arrive at our destination. The American Public Transportation Association, whose members include RIPTA and 350 other transit systems conducts an annual survey of base fares for adults. Of those that responded to the 2010 survey, only four U.S. systems charged more than RIPTA, ranging from $2.25 in San Diego to $3.65 in San Francisco.\n\nSo what have we learned during our ride? When we confined our comparison to New England, just as Odimgbe stated, we could not find another bus system charging as much as RIPTA\u2019s $2 base fare. And while several of these do not charge to transfer to other buses, RIPTA tacks on another 50 cents. RIPTA\u2019s monthly pass also is substantially higher.\n\nHowever, while RIPTA lets patrons travel all the way across the state for no more than $2.50, \u00a0riders in Boston and Connecticut have to pay substantially more to travel comparable distances.\n\nSo, Odimgbe\u2019s claim that RIPTA is \"one of the most expensive rides in New England\" is true for base fares, but not when it comes to longer trips"}

Thanks Chief Fernandez!\"", "evidence": "The police union in Hollywood has launched a high-profile battle in an effort to oust Chief Frank Fernandez, and they have literally taken their message to the sky.\nIn March, the Police Benevolent Association floated a banner from an airplane that flew over the beach and downtown that declared, \"Hollywood a high crime area. Thanks Chief Fernandez!\"\nThen on April 15, the PBA posted a billboard on Pembroke Road that stated: \"Hollywood is #1 in Broward homicides in 2013. Thanks Chief Fernandez!\"\nWe decided to investigate whether the homicide statistic is accurate and if Fernandez can be blamed for it.\nHollywood police department battles\nTo understand the backdrop of the billboard requires a bit of history about the years of feuds between city officials and police union leaders in this city of 145,000. In 2011, the city declared financial urgency and cut officers\u2019 pay, which led to protests from the union and officer turnover.\nFernandez became the city\u2019s assistant city manager overseeing public safety in 2012 and chief in 2013, and he\u2019s been tasked with trying to turn around the long-troubled department.\nThough Hollywood has a popular beach front that draws tourists and snowbirds, it\u2019s also had some famous scandals in recent years. In 2007, a handful of officers convicted in a scheme that included selling heroin to undercover agents posing as mobsters. (The chief at the time was accused of leaking information about the probe before the arrests, forcing the FBI to bring it to a close prematurely.)\nA separate group of officers drew national attention in 2009 after one of them crashed into a vehicle, and video captured employees saying they would \"do a little Walt Disney\" to protect the officer and doctor a police report.\nNews reports in the Sun-Sentinel indicate Fernandez has had some success: He has increased recruiting, made physical improvements to the police station and brought a close to contract negotiations.\nFernandez also brought in outside consultants to audit the agency, and they found problems with its use-of-force policy, missing internal affairs files and forgotten rape kits, the Sun-Sentinel reported. The union disputes the audit and says it was written by a hired consultant tasked with finding fault. The billboard is the latest round in the battle between the police union and city leaders who say it\u2019s just another ploy.\nHollywood crime statistics\nJeff Marano, president of the police union, sent us Hollywood crime statistics from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The data showed homicides in the city rose from five in 2012 to 16 in 2013.\nA spokeswoman for the city didn\u2019t dispute the numbers but said they come with some caveats. First, the homicides were either drug- or gang-related or domestics, Raelin Storey said.\n\"There were not random acts of murder taking place in the city of Hollywood,\" she said.\nThe reasons behind the homicides aren\u2019t the point, Marano said.\n\"A homicide is a homicide,\" he said. \"It\u2019s a dead person.\"\nAssessing whether the number of homicides placed Hollywood in the No. 1 slot in Broward was more complicated because statewide data for 2013 hasn\u2019t been published yet. (Marano said he determined Hollywood was the highest by speaking with a Hollywood homicide detective who speaks with his counterparts at other departments.)\nSo we decided to do our own research and contact law enforcement agencies in Broward County to ask them to supply the number of homicides in their city in 2013. We mostly focused our search on the larger cities or the ones that had more than five homicides in 2012.\nThe results:\nHollywood: 16\n\n"}

Bob McDonnell in 2010 \"did not even create enough jobs to keep pace with population growth\" in Virginia.", "evidence": "In a sluggish economy where the spotlight has been on elected officials\u2019 efforts to boost employment, the state Democratic Party is saying Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell\u2019s job creation efforts are disappointing.\n\nA Feb. 25 news release from the Democratic Party of Virginia cited statistics from a Bureau of Labor Statistics report released that same day showing Virginia\u2019s monthly unemployment rates during 2010 averaged out at 6.9 percent. That\u2019s a slight increase from the 2009 average of 6.8 percent.\n\nThe Democrats also noted the BLS reported a drop in the state\u2019s percentage of working age people with jobs. It fell from 64.9 percent in 2009 to 64.1 percent in 2010.\n\nBrian Moran, chairman of the Democratic Party of Virginia, fired out a news release charging the numbers demonstrate \"the governor and his team did not even create enough jobs to keep pace with population growth.\"\n\nWe dove into the BLS numbers to see if Moran is right.\n\nWe started with his claim that in 2010 - the first year of \u00a0McDonnell\u2019s term - \u00a0Virginia\u2019s average monthly unemployment rate rose .1 percent to 6.9 percent. That\u2019s true, but it provides an skewed picture.\n\nThat\u2019s because when McDonnell was inaugurated in January 2010, the state unemployment rate was 7.2 percent -- its highest point of the year. The rate slowly declined the rest of the year and ended at 6.6 percent by December, ranking Virginia 9th lowest in the nation.\n\nIn other words, the unemployment rate improved during McDonnell\u2019s first year as governor. And one could make an argument that, when it comes to computing the monthly average for 2010, McDonnell was hurt by a relatively high unemployment rate he inherited from his predecessor, Democrat Tim Kaine.\n\nMoran doesn\u2019t go there. Nor does he mention that Virginia\u2019s monthly unemployment rate in 2009 -- Kaine\u2019s last full year in office -- increased from 5.7 percent in January to 7.2 percent in December.\n\nWe\u2019re not pointing this out to say one governor performed better that the other. Economists have repeatedly told us that governors have a limited impact on employment in their states. We\u2019re merely pointing out that there\u2019s a variety of ways to interpret these statistics.\n\nVirginia\u2019s 6.9 percent unemployment rate for 2010 was far better than the national rate of 9.6 percent.\n\nLet\u2019s turn to Moran\u2019s second assertion, that percentage of working-age Virginians with jobs fell from 64.9 percent in 2009 to 64.1 percent in 2010. His numbers are correct.\n\nWe were curious whether the percentage of the state\u2019s population with jobs continued to improve throughout 2010 just like the unemployment rate did.\n\nTo the contrary, the numbers got worse. \u00a0The percentage of employed working-age Virginians declined from 64.3 percent in January to 63.9 percent in December.\n\nSo, as Moran says the population growth did indeed outpace job growth in 2010. But is that McDonnell\u2019s fault?\n\nHoward Wial, an economist and fellow with the left-leaning Brookings Institution, is dismissive of Moran\u2019s use of the BLS statistics to to fault McDonnell.\n\n\"I\u2019m not saying the governor is right that he\u2019s been a wonderful job creator or that the Democrats are right in saying he hasn\u2019t been,\" Wial said. \"I\u2019m just saying that these numbers don\u2019t prove anything either way \u2026 They don\u2019t show you any connection between public policy and results.\"\n\nVirginia, with 64.1 percent of its working age population employed last year, out-performed the national average of 58.5 percent. Just like Virginia, the national percentage of working age people who were employed declined by .8 percent from 2009 to 2010.\n\nAt the end of Kaine\u2019s term, the percentage of employed working-age Virginians fell by 1.8 percent -- from 66.7 percent in 2008 to 64.9 percent in 2009. So the same argument Moran uses to disparage McDonnell\u2019s performance could also be hurled at Kaine.\n\nLet\u2019s review.\n\nMoran uses two sets of data to prove his point that job growth lagged a rise in population during McDonnell\u2019s first year as governor.\n\nHe says Virginia\u2019s the average of Virginia\u2019s monthly unemployment rates rose in 2010.While technically correct, a month-to-month review shows the unemployment rate was at a high point when McDonnell took office in January and fell throughout the year. Moran\u2019s use of the annual unemployment rates is misleading and cloaks that improvement.\n\nMoran also cites a drop in the percentage of working-age Virginians who were employed last year. The numbers certainly confirm his claim that state job growth did not keep pace with population growth. So he\u2019s right on the trend, but it\u2019s questionable whether the sluggish job environment can be laid at the feet of a governor who has been in office for a year.\n\nWhile there is some truth in Moran\u2019s statement, he also uses a misleading figure to paint\u00a0an inaccurate picture of the jobs situation under McDonnell"}

{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Barack Obama \"Romney outsourced call center jobs to India.\"", "evidence": "A super PAC ad uses the splendor of the Olympics opening ceremonies as a backdrop to denounce Mitt Romney as an outsourcer and tax dodger.\n\nThe ad, by the pro-Barack Obama group Priorities Action USA, opens with an overhead shot of an Olympic stadium packed with people, cameras flashing. Romney, who led the 2002 Salt Lake City games, strides onto a stage and waves.\n\nOlympic teams from China, India, Burma, Switzerland, Bermuda and the Cayman Islands parade in as an announcer makes multiple charges that Romney sent American jobs overseas and stashed his personal wealth in offshore accounts.\n\n\"Welcome to the Olympics,\" the voiceover says. \"There\u2019s Mitt Romney, who ran the Salt Lake City games, waving to China, home to a billion people. Thousands owe their jobs to Mitt Romney\u2019s companies.\n\n\"India, which also gained jobs thanks to Romney, an outsourcing pioneer. And Burma, where Romney had the uniforms made for the 2002 games.\"\n\nThe announcer continues with claims about countries where Romney has had bank accounts or corporations.\n\nThe ad was apparently removed from YouTube because of copyright concerns, but we are checking its claims because they received so much coverage on cable news channels and the Web. Here we\u2019ll look at the claim that India \"gained jobs thanks to Romney.\" (We've previously examined the claim he was a \"pioneer\" of outsourcing.)\n\nOutsourcing governor?\n\nA spokesman for Priorities USA Action provided two different examples to back this up: a state contract that included use of a call center in India while Romney was governor of Massachusetts and a software company that also had a call center in India while it was owned by Romney's firm Bain Capital.\n\nFirst, the call center from Romney's days as governor.\n\nLast month, the Obama campaign released an an ad that said Romney, while governor of Massachusetts, \"outsourced call center jobs to India.\" PolitiFact looked into that claim and found it wasn't so clear-cut. We rated it Half True.\n\nWhen he was governor, Massachusetts had a $160,000 a month contract with Citigroup to process debit cards for food stamps, as well as offshore contracts through its child support enforcement and unemployment insurance programs in 2005. Citigroup outsourced its customer service call center to a facility in India.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSo it\u2019s an important point that the state wasn\u2019t outsourcing work to India -- a state contractor was. But Romney chose not to to end the arrangement.\n\nDuring budget negotiations in 2004, the second year of Romney\u2019s term, the Democratic-controlled legislature sent Romney a budget with an amendment that \"would prohibit Massachusetts from contracting with companies that \u2018outsource\u2019 the state's work to other countries,\" according to the Boston Globe.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAt the time, many states were contracting with companies that outsourced some form of their work overseas. The Government Accountability Office found that in 2005, 43 states had contracts with companies administering state programs in which some of the work, primarily customer service and software development, was done overseas. The revelation prompted 38 states to consider similar bans on contracting with companies that outsourced, the Globe wrote.\n\nRomney was forced to weigh two competing interests: protecting and promoting jobs in his state vs. saving taxpayers money. The Globe pointed out that lawmakers in Kansas considered a similar measure but pulled the plug when they learned it would cost the state an additional $640,000. The prohibition in Massachusetts\u2019 was favored by labor unions but opposed by some economists who said it didn\u2019t make economic sense for taxpayers to pay more for low-skill jobs. Ultimately, Romney vetoed the measure because he said that even if those jobs were back in the United States, they would not necessarily have been in Massachusetts.\n\nOutsourcing claims at Bain\n\nPriorities USA Action also pointed us to Bain\u2019s involvement with the technical support firm Stream International. Bain bought a stake in the software company CSI in 1993, and later merged it with another firm to form Stream International, according to the Washington Post. In the mid 1990s, Stream was setting up tech-support call centers outside the U.S.\n\nThere's no question that Stream had employees in India because it boasted in an October 2000 news release that it had a joint venture with the Indian company Tracmail to provide customer service at locations that included India.\n\nHowever, Romney left Bain in 1999 to head the Salt Lake City Olympics, so he was gone from day-to-day operations by the time of this press release, though he remained CEO of Bain until 2002. But PolitiFact has rated claims of his continued involvement to be Half True because he founded the company and was responsible for its overall direction, and documents indicate he continued to be involved to some extent for the next couple of years.\n\n\n Our ruling\n\nPriorities USA Action said that India \"gained jobs thanks to Romney.\"\n\nWhile Romney was governor, Massachusetts had contracts with companies that had customer service call centers in India. That\u2019s not the same as the state directly sending work overseas, but Romney blocked a legislative effort to stop it. And it's reasonable to conclude that India gained some jobs, at least while the Massachusetts arrangement was in effect.\n\nAt Bain, he was part of a move to invest in CSI, which later merged with another firm to form Stream International, which announced the call centers in India a year after Romney departed to run the Olympics. So yes, India got some jobs from CSI, but Romney's influence was early and ultimately indirect.\n\nAs for being a pioneer, Romney and Bain joined the bandwagon, but they didn\u2019t lead it. Outsourcing was an established practice by private equity firms to cut costs at companies they invested in. \u00a0They were more like disciples than pioneers"}

So that\u2019s a lot of risk, and I think one of the most important things homeowners want is if there ever is a disaster that their insurance company is going to be able to pay the bill.\"\n\nIn a survey given to the Florida Council of 100 last month, Scott got more specific, stating that the state-run insurer had $504.8 billion in total risk exposure and only $6.1 billion in cash surplus.\n\nIt\u2019s a jarring numerical juxtaposition used to show that Citizens is severely undercapitalized and, if a major hurricane hits, would spur untold financial calamity for the state.\n\u00a0\nFearing so-called \"hurricane taxes,\" Scott asked the Citizens board of governors to find ways to drastically reduce the company\u2019s size and exposure late last year. (Citizens currently has issued about 1.4 million policies.) The board came up with more than 30 proposals, most of which would lead to increased rates or reduced coverage for policyholders. To justify those painful rate hikes, proponents point to the weak financial position of Citizens, often comparing its cash on hand to its maximum exposure.\n\nA growing chorus of critics say Scott and insurance industry insiders are using exaggerated, apocalyptic language to incite fear and justify large increases on insurance premiums.\n\nThe numbers are extreme, to say the least. After six years without a single hurricane hitting Florida, could Citizens\u2019 finances really be that frightful?\n\nWe did a little digging and found that Scott\u2019s statements about Citizens\u2019 financial assets and liabilities, while technically true, omit major components of the financial structure of Citizens.\n\nFirst, on the side of Citizens\u2019 \"surplus.\" The state-run insurer does, indeed, have nearly $6 billion in cash reserves, money it has been able to build up during the last six hurricane-free years. But that cash\u2014 the most Citizens has ever had--is only part of the pot the insurer uses to pay hurricane claims.\n\nFew, if any, property insurers rely solely on cash surplus to pay claims in the wake of catastrophe. Citizens, like every other licensed property insurer in Florida, has backup insurance from the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund. It also has private reinsurance worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFinally, Citizens has the ability to sell bonds to pay the cover claims that exceed its surplus and reinsurance coverage.\n\nAltogether, Citizens has about $19.5 billion in claims-paying ability, more than three times the amount cited by the governor. Most of that could be paid out before any assessments, or \"hurricane taxes\" would be required from non-Citizens policyholders.\n\nThe other half of Scott\u2019s statement mentions that Citizens has $500 billion in total exposure to risk.\n\nThis is also true, but it has little to do with whether Citizens \"is going to be able to pay the bill\" after a storm.\n\nWhat would it take for Florida to actually have to pay out $500 billion in claims? A superstorm 25 times as ferocious as Hurricane Andrew would have to hit South Florida, and zigzag its way through Florida\u2019s peninsula, hitting all 67 counties and damaging or destroying every home and business with a Citizens policy. A series of back-to-back, Andrew-sized storms up and down the state could also do the trick.\n\nIn the absence of such an apocalyptic occurrence, a more realistic estimate of maximum losses would be the 1-in-100-year storm, the so-called \"Big One,\" that would cause more damage than Hurricane Andrew in 1992.\n\nEstimates indicate that kind of storm -- which only has a 1-percent chance of occurring in a given year -- would cost Citizens a maximum of $21 billion.\n\nThis number, while large and financially troublesome for Citizens, is nowhere near the $500 billion often repeated by the governor.\n\nScott spokesman Lane Wright said regardless of which numbers are presented, the fact that Citizens remains in a precarious financial position is central.\u00a0\n\n\"No matter how you slice it, in the worst case storm, the one-in-100-year storm, Citizens still falls short of being able to pay its claims,\" Wright said, adding that Florida could also get hit with several back-to-back storms. \"That\u2019s a fact.\"\n\nThat\u2019s true -- but those aren\u2019t the words Scott has been using. He\u2019s opted for the gasp-inducing $6-billion-versus-$500-billion language.\n\nOur ruling\n\nScott has said repeatedly that Citizens has more than $500 billion worth of risk, but about $6 billion in cash surplus. But the $500-billion number vastly overstates what Citizens might have to pay in even the most vicious storm season imaginable.\u00a0And the $6-billion figure undercounts Citizens\u2019 ability to pay claims.\n\nSo those numbers are not the appropriate figures to use when determining whether the insurer \"is going to be able to pay the bill\" after a storm. More appropriate numbers would compare Citizens\u2019 total claims-paying ability (about $19.5 billion) to the damage caused by a once-in-a-century kind of hurricane (about $21 billion).\u00a0\n\n"}
{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Mario Gallegos Says that 98,184 Texans are now driving with temporary driver\u2019s licenses lacking their photos.", "evidence": "A Democratic state senator warned Tuesday that a Republican-sought mandate requiring Texas voters to present photo IDs at the polls could leave nearly 100,000 drivers unable to cast ballots.\n\nSen. Mario Gallegos of Houston specified that 98,184 residents \"are driving with this paper right here,\" waving a sheet of paper we took to be a state form, and without a license featuring their photo. His point: Such Texans would be prevented from voting if the legislation before the Senate passes into law.\n\nGallegos\u2019 statement came up as he pressed Republican senators to speak to how the proposal would affect drivers who relinquish their licenses to law enforcement officers and are then given temporary licenses.\n\n\"I\u2019ve known some folks that have had their licenses pulled and have not gone through the process, and there\u2019s no photo ID. All they\u2019re given is the sheet of paper that I have right here, that they\u2019re driving with,\" Gallegos said. \"98,184 that are driving with this paper right here, no photo ID.\"\n\nSen. Tommy Williams, R-The Woodlands, replied that the issue needs clearing up.\n\nWe reached Gallegos\u2019 legislative director, Debra Gonzales, who shared information she attributed to the Texas Department of Public Safety stating that in 2010, 98,184 people were arrested for violating provisions of the Texas Transportation Code related to operating a motor vehicle or watercraft under the influence of alcohol. Section 524.011 of the code says the officer shall issue a temporary driving permit \"unless department records show or the officer otherwise determines that the person does not hold a driver\u2019s license to operate a motor vehicle\" in Texas. The 2010 number is down from the recent high of 103,155, set in 2007, according to the information.\n\nGonzales forwarded a copy of the form for the temporary permit, which says: \"If your Texas driver license was confiscated, this document will serve as your temporary driving permit... This permit is valid for 40 days from the date of service,\" meaning the date the original license was taken away. If a driver seeks a hearing, though, the temporary permit remains valid until a judge makes a final decision in their case.\n\nNext, we contacted the DPS. Spokesman Tom Vinger said that once a detained driver is moved to a police station or sheriff\u2019s office, he or she is asked to take a chemical test measuring blood alcohol concentration.The officer tells the driver their license will be suspended if they refuse to take the test or fail it. The officer also confiscates the original license and issues a temporary driving permit.\n\nIn an e-mail, Vinger said that 98,184 people were arrested for driving while intoxicated during 2010. He cautioned, though, that not all of the drivers ended up with temporary licenses.\n\nVinger also noted that a driver who has had their license confiscated due to a DWI arrest remains eligible for a Texas-issued identification card, which includes a photograph. The six-year cards typically cost $16, he said.\n\nGonzales, Gallegos\u2019 aide, later agreed that arrested individuals could obtain state photo IDs, potentially satisfying the proposed voter ID law, though she said doing so might involve hassles. The bigger point, she said by e-mail, is \"that out of 100,000 people per year that get arrested for DWIs,\" the voter ID proposal is \"bound to negatively impact one as a voter, disenfranchising them. And if one is affected, then it\u2019s one too many.\"\n\nOur sense: Gallegos\u2019 statement incorrectly assumes everyone arrested for DWI during 2010 not only received a temporary license when arrested but is currently driving with such a license. DPS did not pinpoint the number of current drivers with temporary permits. Also, affected individuals can get other state-issued photo IDs"}

But that\u2019s \"untrue\" and, in fact, \"there\u2019s virtually no vetting,\" according to Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who chairs the House Subcommittee on Terrorism.\nElsewhere on the airwaves, Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush suggested that the vetting process was at least enough to distinguish between Christians \u2014 whom the United States should focus on, according to Bush \u2014 and everyone else fleeing Syria.\n\"It takes almost a year for a refugee to be processed in the United States,\" Bush noted on CNN\u2019s State of the Union.\nWe were curious if that\u2019s how long the refugee vetting process takes. We found that Bush is actually understating the duration, especially for those from Syria and other countries where terrorism is a concern.\nLet\u2019s begin with an overview of the refugee admissions process.\nBefore a refugee even faces U.S. vetting, he or she must first clear an eligibility hurdle. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \u2014 or occasionally a U.S. embassy or another NGO \u2014 determines which refugees (about 1 percent) should be resettled through its own process, which can take four to 10 months.\nAs we noted in a previous fact-check, once a case is referred from the UNHCR to the United States, a refugee undergoes a security clearance check that could take several rounds, an in-person interview, approval by the Department of Homeland Security, medical screening, a match with a sponsor agency, \"cultural orientation\" classes, and one final security clearance. This all happens before a refugee ever gets onto American soil.\nKaren Jacobsen, the director of the Refugee and Forced Migration Program at Tufts University noted that this intensive vetting process as well as U.S law on refugees and asylum seekers \"makes it difficult to quickly admit large numbers of refugees.\"\nSo how long does it take? Worldwide, about a year to 18 months, according to a State Department fact-sheet cited by the Bush campaign. A different page on the State Department website estimates an average time of 18 to 24 months.\n\n"}
{"label": "true", "claim": "Sheldon Whitehouse \"There are already more American jobs in the solar industry than in coal mining.\"", "evidence": "For more than a year, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse has delivered weekly Senate speeches about the dangers of climate change. He frequently denounces climate-change deniers, and urges growth of green jobs and technologies to reduce America\u2019s reliance on foreign fossil fuel.\nIn a May 27, 2014 commentary in The Providence Journal, Whitehouse argued for a nationwide price on carbon pollution. And he expressed hope for a prosperous, clean-energy future and faith that \"there is more economic security in our own American know-how than in corrupt foreign fossil fuel countries.\"\nTo that end, Whitehouse noted that there \"are already more American jobs in the solar industry than in coal mining.\"\nThis claim is reminiscent of his November 2012 statement that \"we have more people working in clean and green energy than in oil and gas in this country.\" (PolitiFact Rhode Island ruled that claim as True.)\nThe solar industry has seen tremendous growth. \u00a0But have solar industry jobs actually eclipsed the number of coal-mining jobs?\nWhitehouse communications director Seth Larson cited two sources to back up the senator\u2019s claim.\nThe first is a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report issued in May 2013 that counts an estimated 80,030 jobs for all occupations within the coal-mining \u00a0industry -- a sector of the coal industry as a whole.\nFor solar jobs, Larson cited The Solar Foundation\u2019s \"National Solar Jobs Census 2013,\" which states that the solar industry \"employs 142,698 Americans as of November 2013.\"\nFirst, let\u2019s look at coal-mining jobs.\nWe checked with the Bureau of Labor Statistics and found that Whitehouse had quoted the May 2013 number correctly. (The more recent April 2014 BLS month survey counted \u00a078,500 coal-mining jobs. Neither of those include self-employed contractors.)\nBLS press officer Gary Steinberg said its estimated numbers are drawn from \"an annual survey of employers, by occupation,\" based on data sent by businesses. They reflect jobs, not people.\nWe also found three other sets of coal-mining numbers. Spoiler alert: they are not all apples-to-apples. They use different methodologies and different definitions. But they provide an overall picture.\nA 2013 report from the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration cited 123,227 jobs -- substantially more than the BLS, but still less than the number of solar jobs Whitehouse cited. MHSA surveys the mines themselves as opposed to the companies, and therefore includes contractors as well as regular workers. \u00a0\u00a0\nSNL Energy, a leading energy data provider, analyzes MSHA data to capture \"snapshot\" industry trends. Its June 2014 report, \"U.S. coal miner employment sustains free fall beyond 2nd year,\" cites an 8.3% drop in \u00a0the one-year period ending March 31, to 79,658 employees. That excludes contractors and 33 not-yet-reported mines. \u00a0\nBy contrast, the National Mining Association, a trade group, counted 195,494 coal-mining jobs in 2012. The breakdown: miners (including contractors): 137,650; support activities: 6,930; transportation: 50,914. That\u2019s nearly 53,000 more than Whitehouse\u2019s solar jobs number.\nSpokeswoman Nancy Gravatt said the NMA maintains that the additional support services \"should be included because all of these activities are integral to the daily work in the mines.\"\n\n"}

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "National Republican Congressional Committee Says Washington\u2019s Kim Schrier has a plan to eliminate employer-provided health coverage, double income taxes and put your care \"in the hands of government bureaucrats.\"", "evidence": "\"Medicare for All\" is today\u2019s catch phrase for government supported, single-payer health care, and if you\u2019re a free-market Republican, that can sound like a path toward socialism. Kim Schrier, a pediatrician in Washington state who\u2019s running for Congress, uttered that phrase, and Republicans in the other Washington (D.C.) even have it on videotape.\n\"Look, ultimately I think we do need to go to a Medicare for All system,\" Schrier said.\nThe video clip, with suspenseful music added for emphasis, is part of an ad put out by the National Republican Campaign Committee, or NRCC, an arm of the Republican Party that supports Republicans running for the U.S. House of Representatives. The NRCC supports Dino Rossi, a Republican former state senator, in the race for the open seat in Washington\u2019s 8th Congressional District, which stretches from the Seattle suburbs across the Cascades.\nMedicare for All, the Republican ad says, would mean \"your employer-based health coverage\" would be \"eliminated. Your income tax could double. Kim Schrier\u2019s plan will put your health care in the hands of government bureaucrats and require historic tax increases for Washington families. Washington can\u2019t afford Kim Schrier in Congress.\"\nWe could approach this by asking whether \"Medicare for All\" would do this, as we\u2019ll do briefly. But another question arises: Does Schrier really have a plan like this? Let\u2019s see.\nDefinitions\nMedicare for All can mean different things. In its broadest sense, it means that the country would get rid of the current system of multiple health insurers vying for your or your employer\u2019s premiums. Instead, the government would build on an existing\u00a0taxpayer-supported system: Medicare, the federal program that already covers seniors age 65 and older.\nIt does not mean the government would pick your doctor or hospital. Instead, the government would set or negotiate payment rates to providers, and you\u2019d go to the doctor of your choice. The costs and many other details for such a system are in debate, with critics saying that even a doubling\u00a0of all individual and corporate income taxes would be insufficient.\nSupporters say the savings in health care premiums and administrative costs would balance this out, and one proposed bill in the House\u00a0\u2014 a bill with 123 co-sponsors, all Democrats \u2014\u00a0would raise taxes on the incomes of the top 5 percent of earners and on stock and bond transactions. (For a fuller look at this, check out PolitiFact\u2019s annotated checks of an op-ed by President Donald Trump, who called Medicare for All part of Democrats\u2019 \"radical agenda.\")\nBut there are variations on this idea within Congress. One set of proposals would let you or your employer keep the insurance you have but, alternatively, let you buy coverage in the Medicare system if you wanted. Another set of proposals would only open Medicare to individuals and small employers, keeping large-employer insurance largely unchanged. And yet another would allow Medicare buy-in only to people age 50 or 55.\nEach one of these variations has been introduced in Congress. The Kaiser Family Foundation has a handy side-by-side comparison of eight of these bills.\nWhat Schrier wants\nOn her campaign website, Schrier says \"quality health care is a fundamental human right,\" and that is why she says she wants Medicare for All \u2014 but not yet. It will take time, she says, because it will take a Democrat in the White House and Democratic majorities in Congress to pass, and then more time to implement.\nFor now, she says, Congress should allow a voluntary buy-in.\n\"Too many Washingtonians face skyrocketing healthcare costs, and we need to take immediate steps to help them get the coverage they need and deserve,\" her website says. \"That\u2019s why I am committed to moving us toward a Medicare for All system that guarantees affordable, high-quality care for every American. Medicare has proven to be the most cost-efficient way to deliver high-quality care.\n\"But we cannot simply wait for a Democratic president and Democratic majorities in Congress to pass a bill that will take years to implement. In the meantime, we need to take immediate action to stabilize our insurance market and build on the ACA (Affordable Care Act) in the short term and implement a Medicare public option immediately, as we work toward a universal system.\"\n\n"}

{"label": "true", "claim": "Barack Obama \"The deficit was on track to top $1 trillion the year I took office.\"", "evidence": "In a televised address to the nation on July 25, 2011, to discuss the pending deadline on the debt ceiling, President Barack Obama laid out his version of how the deficit situation got to where it is. And Obama placed much of the blame at the feet of his predecessor, George W. Bush.\n\n\"For the last decade, we\u2019ve spent more money than we take in,\" Obama said. \"In the year 2000, the government had a budget surplus. But instead of using it to pay off our debt, the money was spent on trillions of dollars in new tax cuts, while two wars and an expensive prescription drug program were simply added to our nation\u2019s credit card.\n\n\"As a result, the deficit was on track to top $1 trillion the year I took office.\"\n\nWe've dealt with the \"what-Obama-inherited\" question before. Obama's suggestion that the deficit woes the country now faces are the result of Bush's tax cuts and an expensive prescription drug program -- rather than the recession -- is certainly debatable. But since many Republicans are blaming the problem on reckless spending by Obama, we decided to check his claim that \"the deficit was on track to top $1 trillion the year I took office.\"\n\nIn January, 2009, just prior to Obama being sworn in as president, the government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released an estimate of the projected deficit for the 2009 fiscal year (which straddled both Bush's and Obama's terms).\n\nAccording to the CBO report, \"The ongoing turmoil in the housing and financial markets has taken a major toll on the federal budget. CBO currently projects that the deficit this year will total $1.2 trillion, or 8.3 percent of GDP.\"\n\nThe CBO cited a number of factors for why the federal fiscal situation would be \"dramatically worse\" in 2009 than 2008.\n\nAccording to the CBO, \"A drop in tax revenues and increased federal spending (much of it related to the government\u2019s actions to address the crisis in the housing and financial markets) both contribute to the robust growth in this year\u2019s deficit. Compared with receipts last year, collections from corporate income taxes are anticipated to decline by 27 percent and individual income taxes by 8 percent; in normal economic conditions, they would both grow by several percentage points. In addition, the estimated deficit includes outlays of more than $180 billion to reflect the cost of transactions of the TARP.\"\n\nIn addition, the CBO noted, as a result of the recession, the federal government boosted spending on programs such as those providing unemployment compensation and nutrition assistance.\n\nAgain, this was the deficit projection for 2009 before Obama took office. The CBO acknowledged it might get worse.\n\n\"That total ($1.2 trillion deficit), however, does not include the effects of any future legislation,\" the CBO noted. \"Enactment of an economic stimulus package, for example, would add to the 2009 deficit.\"\n\nAs we know, of course, the Democrat-controlled Congress did pass a massive economic stimulus package. And, in fact, due in large part to the stimulus, the actual deficit for 2009 ended up about $200 billion more than the CBO projected in January 2009.\u00a0\n\nAn April study from the Pew Charitable Trust\u00a0 found that a combination of factors -- increased government spending, tax cuts and the economic downturn -- were mostly to blame for the large budget deficits.\n\nBut Dean Baker, a liberal economist and co-director of the center for Economic Policy Research, argued in a piece published on the Huffington Post on July 27, 2011, that it's really the recession, and not any policy decisions from the Bush presidency, that are to blame for the unsustainable deficit projections. If the unemployment rate returned to the 4.7 percent rate of 2007, he wrote, the bulk of the deficit would disappear.\n\nTo lay the budget crisis on Bush tax cuts is misleading, Baker wrote.\n\n"}

Nearly 2 million children under age 18 were being raised by at least one gay or lesbian parent, the census estimated.\n\n\nThere have been numerous peer-reviewed studies of same-sex couples raising children.\n\n\nSupporters of same-sex marriage say one of the best grew out of the National Longitudinal Lesbian Family Study, which, since 1986, has been following 154 lesbian mothers who had children through artificial insemination.\n\n\nResearchers questioned 39 boys and 39 girls raised by those couples and compared responses with those of equal numbers of boys and girls raised by a mother and father. Their findings were published in 2012 in the Journal of Developmental & Behavioral Pediatrics.\n\n\n\"Our results revealed that the [children of the lesbian couples] rated themselves comparably to their counterparts in opposite-sex parent families in\" quality of life, the study concluded.\n\n\nIn March 2013, the 60,000-member American Academy of Pediatrics announced it supports same-sex marriage. In its journal, Pediatrics, it said that \"extensive data from more than 30 years of research reveal that children raised by gay and lesbian parents have demonstrated resilience with regard to social, psychological, and sexual health despite economic and legal disparities and social stigma.\"\n\n\nSO WHAT WAS the research that, according to Yoshihara, changed the landscape of scholarly thinking on the issue, shattering the past studies?\n\n\nWe contacted Yoshihara, who provided links to two recent studies.\n\n\nOne was by Mark Regnerus, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Texas-Austin.\n\n\nRegnerus\u2019 study, published in July 2012 in Social Science Research, asserted that many previous studies finding \"no notable disadvantages\" and/or \"no differences\" for children raised in same-sex families relied on sample sizes that were too small or were biased. And he said they often relied on interviews of the same-sex parents, not the children.\n\n\nRegnerus\u2019 \u00a0New Family Structures Study used a questionnaire on a range of topics to interview just under 3,000 people ages 18 to 39 and asserted that some outcomes were worse for children of same-sex parents. It compared the children of \"lesbian mothers\" and \"gay fathers\" with the children of \"intact\" heterosexual couples.\n\n"}

We got 12,000 people off the street,\" Newsom said during a gubernatorial debate in San Jose on May 8, 2018.\nThe event was broadcast statewide on NBC and NPR stations.\nNewsom is a Democrat and California\u2019s lieutenant governor. He was San Francisco\u2019s mayor from January 2004 through January 2011. Before that, he served eight years on the San Francisco County Board of Supervisors starting in January 1997.\nPolls show Newsom is currently the favorite in the race to succeed Gov. Jerry Brown.\nWhoever becomes California\u2019s next governor will be faced with a growing homeless crisis, one made worse by a lack of affordable housing. Homelessness in the state shot up nearly 14 percent in 2017, as it remained flat nationwide, according to federal data and our recent fact check on the topic.\nGiven the importance of the issue, we wanted to know whether Newsom got his facts right.\nWe set out on a fact check.\nOur research \nWe started by examining Newsom\u2019s claim about a 40 percent reduction in the city\u2019s \"street population,\" which includes people living outside, in abandoned buildings, tents, cars and storage structures. It\u2019s a subset of the city\u2019s overall homeless population, which includes people living in emergency shelters and transitional housing.\nSome might interpret Newsom\u2019s statement as meaning the city\u2019s overall homeless population dropped significantly during his time in office. That\u2019s not the case. But because Newsom twice referenced \"street population,\" we examined that category.\nThough he doesn\u2019t give a timeframe, we assumed Newsom was speaking mainly about his tenure as mayor.\nNathan Click, Newsom\u2019s campaign spokesman, said the candidate\u2019s statement is supported when comparing street population totals from 2002 to 2009, or two years before he became mayor to two years before he left that office.\nA 2009 San Francisco Homeless Count and Survey does show the total dropped 40 percent, from 4,535 individuals to 2,709.\n\nBy 2011, however, the city\u2019s street total climbed to 3,100, a gain of about 400 people over Newsom\u2019s final two years as mayor, according to the city survey from that year.\nTrent Rhorer, who served as Newsom\u2019s homeless czar, has worked as executive director of the San Francisco Human Services Agency since 2000.\nHe said the increase during the last part of Newsom\u2019s tenure took place \"in the context of a massive recession\" that forced many onto the streets.\nRhorer said it was also driven by the shuttering of several nonprofit homeless programs, including two drop-in centers, a shelter and a treatment program when private landlords sold buildings housing those services. Even considering the uptick in the last two years of Newsom\u2019s term, the city\u2019s unsheltered total still decreased by 31 percent from 2002 to 2011, he noted.\n\n"}

But a July story in the Covington News quotes Perdue as saying the department should be \"defunded\" and fixed.\nIn October, the Political Insider blog referred to the MDJ story calling for the department to be abolished and quoted a campaign spokeswoman as saying Perdue\u2019s plan called for shifting money from the federal to the local level.\nPerdue did not respond to repeated requests to clarify those comments. However, when asked by Channel 2 Action News to address the specific charge at a press conference at the National Federation of Independent Business on Oct. 2, he did not deny the claim.\n\"My position all along on this has been that big government is not producing results,\" Perdue said. \"So what I would look at doing is moving a lot of those dollars that go into the federal government back in the local school systems where the best decision can be made.\"\nStates handle nearly all education policy and issues. At the federal level, the Education Department conducts research, enforces federal anti-discrimination laws and, as the ad says, handles federal financial aid in loans and grants.\n\n"}

Bush unsuccessfully proposed a plan to quasi-privatize the entitlement program for younger workers.\nMany Republicans (not just Heck and Bush) have supported adding optional private accounts for younger workers as a way to extend the life of the entitlement program, which is scheduled to run out of reserve funds in 2034 and be unable to pay out full benefits to future beneficiaries.\nHere\u2019s what Heck has actually proposed or has mentioned as a potential change for the entitlement program:\n\n\nIndexing the retirement age from 67 to 69 by one month per year for the next 24 years;\n\n\nAllowing younger workers to voluntarily invest retirement funds directed toward Social Security into other private markets;\n\n\nPossibly raising the cap on earnings to which the Social Security tax applies ($118,500 in 2015).\n\n\nIt\u2019s that second point that AFSCME says backs up the claim that Heck wants to \"privatize\" Social Security.

Democrats have seized on state education funding as a way to attack Republican Senate candidate Thom Tillis.\nA recent television ad sponsored by Women Vote directs blame for education cuts at Tillis, current speaker of the house in the Republican-controlled North Carolina House of Representatives. Women Vote is an arm of EMILY's List, a political action committee that supports Democratic women who are in favor of abortion rights.\n\"Speaker Thom Tillis cut almost $500 million from education, causing crowded classrooms and forcing teachers to pay out-of-pocket for school supplies, while Tillis protected tax breaks for yachts and jets,\" the ad said.\nTillis is running against incumbent Democrat Sen. Kay Hagan, whose campaign has also used the $500 million figure -- as have numerous media reports.\nWe wondered if Tillis is responsible for such cuts.\nWhere did the cuts come from?\nWhen we looked at North Carolina's education budget year to year, it has increased every year since Tillis became speaker in 2011. According to a document prepared by the General Assembly, the state education budget was $10.8 billion in the 2010-11 fiscal year and $11.5 billion for 2014-15. (These numbers are adjusted for inflation and include both K-12 and higher education spending.)\nAdditionally, state expenditure per pupil for K-12 has increased since 2011 -- from $5,156 in 2011 to $5,395 in 2013.\nEducation spending in North Carolina comes from a combination of federal, state and local dollars. State funding accounts for more than 62 percent of expenditures.\nSo did Women Vote pull that $500 million cut out of thin air? No, but it's complicated.\nEach year, the North Carolina Office of State Budget and Management creates a continuation budget, which is a tool that outlines how much should be spent to maintain the current service level, without cutting or adding services. The projection might be larger or smaller than previous years because it takes into account factors such as inflation, population growth and operating new facilities. Lawmakers are not obliged to match the continuation budget.\nFor the 2013-15 budget, the state budget office proposed a continuation budget of about $23.6 billion for those two years to maintain the status quo across K-12 and higher education. The budget that state lawmakers passed came up to about $23.1 billion. In total, lawmakers allocated $481 million less than the the continuation budget suggested. (EMILY's List and Hagan's campaign pointed us to this when we asked about the ad.)\nThat shortfall ended up dividing the political parties in North Carolina: Last year, Tillis took to the floor to push lawmakers to pass the budget, while Democrats bashed the bill primarily because they believed the education allocations weren't adequate. The bill passed 65-53\u00a0in the House and 32-17 in the Senate, with no Democratic votes in favor.\nIt\u2019s important to note that the Legislature\u2019s choosing to fund at levels lower than the continuation budget is not a literal budget cut. In raw dollars, the state is spending more money than in previous years.\n\n"}

While an abortion opponent may interpret the cases as allowing abortions \"up to the moment of birth,\" supporters of abortion rights may not see it that way, she said.\nStill, when talking colloquially about support for Roe, most people mean recognizing the existence of a right to have an abortion, or not criminalizing it, Zeigler said. Supporting the rulings in Roe, Doe or Casey is not the same as supporting abortion \"up to the moment of birth,\" she said.\nRoe vs. Wade\nRoe vs. Wade recognized a woman\u2019s constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy, but it also allowed states to restrict abortions \u2014 including banning them altogether \u2014 after the point of fetal viability, except when the life or health of the woman is at stake, said Darren Hutchinson, a law professor at the University of Florida. He said that case did not specify a precise time for viability, but 24 weeks\u2019 gestation has widely been used in medicine and law.\nIn 2016, there were 623,471 legal induced abortions reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Here, we look at Obama\u2019s Vietnam claim.\nLabor law\nBefore diving into what the TPP asks of Vietnam, let\u2019s look at what protections Vietnam already affords workers. The 2013 Vietnamese Constitution provides for \"break policies,\" \"equal and safe\" work conditions and protects against \"discrimination, forced labor\" and under-age workers.\nIt also establishes trade unions to represent workers and protect their legal rights. According to a 2012 \"Law on Trade Unions,\" however, this is an entity \"placed under the leadership of the Communist Party of Vietnam.\" Essentially, all trade unions must affiliate with the Vietnam General Confederation of Labour.\nWe consulted various law firms that cover Vietnamese labor law, and they detailed Vietnam\u2019s already-existing labor protections. According to the the Southeast Asian law firm Tilleke & Gibbins, Vietnam sets a maximum of 48 hours per week and provides mandatory rest periods of at minimum 24 consecutive hours per week. Employers are required to provide protective equipment, and there is maternity leave typically around four months.\nThe labor law firm Fisher Phillips \u00a0classified Vietnam\u2019s labor law as \"employee-friendly.\" We spoke to White House representatives who acknowledged Vietnam had such provisions.\nSo, what then, was Obama referring to as \"unprecedented\" labor reforms?\nWork-in-progress\nThe White House pointed us to a \"consistency plan\" negotiated as part of the TPP, titled the \"United States \u2014 Vietnam Plan for the Enhancement of Trade and Labour Relations.\"\nKey to the plan is the decoupling of labor unions from the government. Workers must be allowed to spontaneously form a grassroots labour union.\u00a0The union must be registered, but not affiliated with, the government, thus allowing it to operate by its own rules and procedures.\n\"Vietnam shall ensure that its law does not mandate a labour union registered with the competent government body to operate according to the Statutes of Vietnam General Confederation of Labour,\" the plan states.\nExperts we spoke to said the term \"unprecedented\" is valid.\n\"The workers can form their own unions,\" said K. William Watson, a trade policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. \"That's going to be a big change for Vietnam just because of the way it currently regulates labor unions. It\u2019s not going to be compatible with the TPP at all.\"\nJohn Sifton, Asia Advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said independent unions are the first step to having workers enforce their own rights.\n\"This other stuff about minimum wage and working ours, all of that, is meaningless if you don\u2019t have unions,\" he said. \"Without unions, without the capacity to organize, whatever workers\u2019 rights are written down on paper don\u2019t have teeth.\"\n\n"}

{"label": "true", "claim": "Martavius Jones \"From a standpoint of the county government, neither school system has received an increase in funding over the past six years.\"", "evidence": "As the brouhaha over schools continues in the state\u2019s largest county, funding issues have stayed secondary to the crucial legal questions involving whether Memphis can successfully force real countywide schools consolidation with its suburban Shelby County neighbors.\n\nBut Martavius Jones, the former Memphis City Schools board president who helped lead the surrender of the system\u2019s charter last year, gave a preview of funding rhetoric likely to grow louder as the July 1, 2013, deadline for completing merger grows near. Given that more than 16 percent of the state\u2019s education money goes to schools in Memphis and Shelby County, how the issue plays out could have a ripple effect on systems across the state.\n\nA private financial planner and executive committee member of the county\u2019s schools merger Transition Planning Commission (TPC), Jones appeared on a Fox 13 News morning show to discuss the legal fight between the city and suburbs.\n\nAfter giving his view that the suburbs were following an unconstitutional path toward splitting the county into essentially seven school districts, Jones said the planning commission\u2019s had created a blueprint for a \"world class\" unified school district. However, he added, \"the funding issue is quite an obstacle.\"\n\n\"From a standpoint of the county government,\" Jones said, \"neither school system has received an increase in funding over the past six years.\"\n\nJones backed up his assertion in an email to us: \"By the time the districts are merged in 2013, it would have been six years since there was an increase in funding from the county.\"\n\nIn terms of their overall budgets, we knew that MCS, still in existence for one final school year, and the for now still suburban-only Shelby County Schools had seen slight increases in overall expenditures.\n\nIn Tennessee, although a large chunk of the most counties\u2019 operating budgets goes toward school operations, the majority of funding for schools comes from the state. So it\u2019s possible that school budgets grew even while local contributions remained flat. And a look at budgets for the county confirms that, every year since the 2008 fiscal year, the county has allocated the same number of property-tax dollars to the county\u2019s schools -- $361,288,000.\n\nThat big number has been apportioned to the county\u2019s two school districts (MCS and SCS) according to enrollment, or what is known as Average Daily Attendance, with the current split about 68 percent for the city and 32 percent for the suburbs. Enrollment numbers fluctuate somewhat each year, so that a marginal fraction of funds seesaw back and forth between MCS and SCS.\n\nMike Ritz, budget chairman for the county commission and its chairman beginning next month, has some real quarrels with how Jones and other school officials frame the funding argument, but he says: \"He\u2019s absolutely right -- since I was elected we\u2019ve stopped paying extra money.\"\n\nWhat irks Ritz is what he calls \"complaining\" by schools officials that the county is not providing more money, because he believes it distracts from the fact that MCS and SCS have seen big increases in money from the state. Some recent changes in the state\u2019s funding formula have increased state funding for larger school districts like those in Shelby, Davidson, Hamilton and Knox County.\n\n\"Quite frankly, they\u2019ve had a humongous increase in funds available,\" Ritz said. \"That\u2019s why I keep telling the commissioners that we don\u2019t need to worry about (increasing funding) when the state continues to do it for them.\"\n\nWe\u2019ll leave that statement aside for a potential future PolitiFact, although public-school advocates have a ready rejoinder. They point out that even while the county has stopped increasing school funding, revenues for county government have been steadily increased. Property tax revenue in 2008 was $675.1 million but is projected at $714.0 million for 2013 -- a 5.6 percent increase. So education funding as a percentage of the county budget has actually dropped.\n\nAnother point Ritz could have made (but didn't) -- enrollment has been dropping slightly in both systems. From 2008-09 to 2011-12, the combined \"weighted\" ADA for MCS and SCS did show a 3-percent drop, so that $361,288,000 in county funds got spread over slightly smaller systems. School officials like to point out, however, that education costs, like healthcare costs, escalate rapidly, though for the purposes of this item we'll point out that overall inflation from 2008 to 2012 was about 6.3 percent.\n\nExpect this debate to continue -- the schools merger Transition Planning Commission\u2019s plan shows a hole in the 2012-13 budget of $68 million, which happens to be equivalent to the funds that Memphis has been contributing in recent years to MCS. But Memphis\u2019s funding, which had been required by courts based on the state\u2019s maintenance-of-effort law, will go away for next fiscal year because MCS will be completely dissolved and its operations transferred to the county by July 1, 2013.\n\nThe TPC has recommended lobbying the city, the state and the county to provide money to patch that funding hole -- the city and state have each strongly indicated that will not happen. Jones knows that as well as anyone, and the county commission can expect to feel even more pressure going forward to increase school funding and fill the the budget hole for the new district.\n\nOur ruling\n\n Ritz may well have a point -- schools officials do bemoan the static local funding even while receiving increases from its chief funding source, the state. But Jones is right -- because the county has not increased schools funding since the 2008 fiscal year, this 2013 fiscal year marks a sixth straight year the county has declined to increase its funding of schools"}

He defended the group when its occupation tried Mayor Kasim Reed\u2019s patience.

What\u2019s this about the scions of wealthy families getting lottery dollars? This makes Georgia sound like a bumbling Robin Hood, taking from the poor and giving to the rich.\n\nWe contacted Rainbow/PUSH for additional information, but it did not respond to our request. \u00a0\n\nIt was clear that the group was referring to the HOPE scholarship program, which uses lottery dollars to fund college and technical-school tuition for any student who meets certain academic standards, regardless of income. Lottery funds also support statewide pre-kindergarten programs.\n\nAt first, the state only gave HOPE scholarships to families that made less than $66,000. Legislators later nixed the limit because they wanted to use it to keep the best-performing students in state, regardless of income. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nUntil recently, HOPE covered 100 percent of tuition at Georgia colleges for high school students graduating with a 3.0 grade-point average.\n\nThe state Legislature made it tougher to get the scholarship in March after the program ran into budget problems. Now, students with a 3.7 average and a 1200 SAT will get full tuition coverage. Those with lower grades will get less money.\n\nSome critics have called the HOPE scholarship welfare for the affluent, claiming that the bulk of the dollars go to students who don\u2019t need financial help. We talked to experts who have studied HOPE and similar broad-based statewide scholarship programs to check the accuracy of Rainbow/PUSH\u2019s claim.\n\nWe found that while it\u2019s likely that the children of some wealthy families received HOPE scholarship money, reality is not as Rainbow/PUSH described it. \u00a0\n\nResearchers have found it\u2019s reasonable to conclude that middle- and upper-income families reap a greater share of the benefits of HOPE. An investigation and resulting series of articles by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution published in 2003 came to a similar conclusion. \u00a0\n\nOther statewide merit scholarship programs have the same problem. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\"I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty much settled,\" said Ross Rubenstein, a Syracuse University professor who has studied HOPE. \"Most of the benefits tend to flow to middle- and upper-income families.\"\n\nOne reason is research consistently shows that children in higher-earning families tend to achieve more academic success. In addition, scholars have known for years that people with less education and lower income tend to spend a greater share of their money on lottery games. \u00a0\n\nA 2002 study co-authored by Rubenstein estimated that households that made $25,000 or less or between $35,000 and $50,000 each year gave more to lottery funds than they received in college scholarships and other benefits. Research published by the National Tax Journal in 2001 suggests that the program widened the gap in college attendance between students from low- and high-income families.\n\nTwo University of Georgia professors found that HOPE scholarships are more likely to be awarded to counties with higher per-capita incomes, although lower-income families tend to spend a greater share of their money on the lottery.\n\nOne peculiar result is that HOPE scholarships may have boosted car sales, according to a study co-authored by University of Georgia professor David Mustard. His research found that county car registrations increased when their number of HOPE recipients attending state-system and private schools rose, so long as the county\u2019s per-capita income was above the 75th percentile.\n\n\"Do the children of really wealthy families get HOPE? Probably yes,\" Mustard said. \"And really poor families do, too. But wealthy families do get it at higher rates.\" \u00a0\n\nBut what researchers know about HOPE and income has its limits. The scholarship application does not ask students to disclose how much their families make, Mustard said, so scholars are unable to do more precise calculations.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that children from upper-income families do receive HOPE scholarship money, as Rainbow/PUSH\u2019s news release stated. But the group\u2019s rhetoric is so strident that it confuses the issue.\n\nTruth does underlie its statement. Middle- and upper- income families tend to receive more of the scholarship\u2019s benefits, even though lower-income families tend to spend a greater share of their money buying the lottery tickets that fund HOPE. \u00a0\n\nStill, it\u2019s not fair to suggest that the program takes from the poor and gives to the rich, or the \"scion[s] of wealthy families,\" as Rainbow/PUSH said. Middle-income families are among the program\u2019s greatest beneficiaries. Lower-income and poor families do receive a notable share of the scholarships.\n\nRainbow/PUSH is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context"}

The pensions were cut after Delphi, which once was part of General Motors, hit deep financial problems.\nBut the rest of the claim, ascribing blame to political favoritism and Obama administration backroom deals, was not supported by facts. We based the ruling on the available evidence, which included Government Accountability Office reports and congressional testimony.\nWe also noted that eventually, a fuller accounting of the Delphi matter would come out from a special inspector general. When it did, we said, we\u2019d consider taking another look.\nThat report is out. And based on it, we are upgrading the rating a notch to Half True.\nSome background: In 2009, GM was in financial trouble and the federal government bailed it out with a financial package worth more than $50 billion, including a loan and an equity stake in a post-bankruptcy, restructured company. There were others in the auto industry also in trouble, including Delphi. And GM and Delphi were the corporate equivalent of step brothers, if not blood relatives. Delphi was a division of GM until the parts maker was spun off as an independent company in 1999.\nBefore the spinoff, Delphi maintained separate pension funds for its unionized and non-unionized workforces. The non-unionized workers were salaried, many in white-collar or support jobs, and their pension fund was flush. The union pension fund, however, was not.\nIn other cases, this might have meant that the unionized workers would eventually get smaller pensions than planned. But in this case, GM made a deal that kept the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, or UAW, happy, which helped facilitate the Delphi spinoff. The deal was this: GM would make up, or \"top-up,\" the difference between the underfunded pension payments and the amounts the workers would have gotten if their pension fund were in fine health.\nThis was not just benevolence. By agreeing to the top-up, GM was able to hand off Delphi operations without union opposition and keep its outside supply chain running. And so the parties codified the top-up provision and kept it in force.\nBut a decade later, the twin bankruptcies of GM and Delphi created a wrinkle. GM had the right in bankruptcy to void its contracts. That could have meant the end to the top-up agreement.\nIt so happened that by now, the fortunes of Delphi\u2019s nonunion workforce and retirees had turned. The once-full pension fund for non-union, or salaried, retirees was underfunded as well.\nBut unlike their unionized colleagues, the salaried or non-unionized retirees had no top-up deal.\nSo what would happen?\nTwo things: First, the Obama administration would agree to bail out General Motors and give it money to keep operating. But before the final sign-off, \u00a0the administration through its Treasury Department-appointed auto task force would need to review GM\u2019s obligations and make decisions about what and whether it owed Delphi retirees.\nBankruptcies typically involve many parties being told to accept the fact that they are never going to get every penny they are owed. Yet that\u2019s not what happened in the case of the Delphi unionized-worker pensions. GM, with considerable help from the Treasury auto team, agreed that even as it exited bankruptcy as a new organization, it would continue to top-up the UAW pensions from its parts supplier. It also agreed to continue top-ups for the International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers, and the United Steelworkers of America.\nBut GM and Treasury\u2019s auto team left the salaried retiree pensions alone. The non-union retirees would get no top-up. As a result, those retirees would only collect 30 percent to 70 percent of their expected pensions, which would be paid by the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp., or PBGC, the federal agency that takes over failing pension plans.\nWas this fair?\n\n"}

Questions still surround her death, which officials called a suicide. But the video gives Americans a clearer look at the explosive start of the arrest that put her behind bars to begin with.\nThe director of the Texas Department of Public Safety criticized Encinia\u2019s actions, saying that the trooper violated arrest procedure. But some people are also questioning Bland\u2019s behavior, including her refusal to put out her cigarette at Encinia\u2019s request.\nDon Lemon led a CNN Tonight panel on July 21 about the ordeal with legal analyst Sunny Hostin, liberal pundit Marc Lamont Hill and retired New York Police Department detective Harry Houck.\nMost of the panel agreed with Hostin\u2019s advice for dealing with law enforcement: Essentially, make the encounter as short as possible by obeying orders and dealing with legal issues or mistreatment later. Lemon then asked Houck to clarify the legal rights that people actually have during a police stop \u2014 and that\u2019s where the discussion got murky.\nLemon asked if all the attention on this encounter and others around the country \"is giving people a false sense of rights that they have, that they really don\u2019t have?\"\nYes, Houck responded.\u00a0\"People actually think, that I've talked to, saying that, no, if a police officer stopped me for something, I don't think he's stopping me for a right reason, but I don't have to cooperate with the officer. But that is wrong,\" he said.\nHouck continued: \"The law says, just like you said, Don, that when a police officer stops you, do whatever he says and then deal with it later.\"\nRead literally, Houck\u2019s statement seems to give law enforcement a lot of leeway during stops. Are civilians really required to obey their each and every order?\nThe video\nBefore we dive into the legal issues underlying Bland\u2019s arrest, let\u2019s review what the video shows. Encinia pulls Bland over for a failure to signal as she changed lanes. Encinia retrieves Bland\u2019s driver\u2019s license and insurance and heads back to his car. After four and a half minutes, Encinia returns to issue a ticket to Bland. At the window, he asks her if she\u2019s okay.\n\"I\u2019m waiting on you, this is your job,\" she says.\n\"You seem very irritated,\" he tells her.\n\"I really am,\" Bland replies, explaining why she\u2019s unhappy that she was pulled over. Encinia asks if she\u2019s done speaking, then asks her to put out her cigarette. Bland refuses, saying that she\u2019s free to smoke a cigarette in her own car.\nEncinia then directs her out of the car, calling it a \"lawful order.\" When she doesn\u2019t move, he opens the door and forcibly removes her, pointing a Taser in her direction and threatening to \"light her up.\"\nAfter Bland exits the car, Encinia issues a number of orders, including for her to put her phone down, to \"come over here,\" to \"stand right here,\" and to \"turn around.\" The confrontation becomes physical shortly afterwards, before Encinia puts Bland in the back of his squad car.\nThe panelists were divided on the issue of whether Bland escalated the situation by claiming rights she did not have when she refused Encinia\u2019s order to put out her cigarette. Experts we consulted said Bland had the right to act the way she did, but Encinia may have, too.

Propark America, a parking management company based in Hartford, Conn., got the five-year contract, which ends this year.\nUnder the deal, Propark paid the state $1,880,857 for the right to collect fees at the seven state-owned beach facilities. If Propark collected more than that sum, it got to keep the rest until its profit hits $502,143.\nBeyond that point, once $2,383,000 in beach fees had been collected, the state got 80 cents of every dollar and Propark got 20 cents.\nThen, in 2011, the General Assembly approved Governor Chafee\u2019s plan to raise money by dramatically increasing the beach fees, effective that July 1.\nDaily weekday rates went from $6 to $10 for residents and from $12 to $20 for non-residents. Weekend and holiday rates doubled, going to $14 for residents and $28 for non-residents. The price of a season passes also doubled. Seniors get a 50-percent discount.\nThe state\u2019s contract with Propark required the state to share 20 percent of the extra revenue.\nAccording to figures from Terrence Maguire, the Department of Environmental Management's assistant director for financial and contract management, Propark's revenue from the contract jumped from $581,039 in 2010 (the summer when the old fees were still in effect), to $734,963 in 2011 (when the old fees remained in effect through June 30).\nPropark's profit increased to $822,595 in 2012 (the first full year of the higher fees).

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Ted Cruz The Senate immigration bill \"has immediate legalization ... and the border security is sometime in the future, and just like in 1986, it's designed never to come into being.\"", "evidence": "A 1986 immigration law signed by President Ronald Reagan casts a long shadow over the current immigration reform debate. Opponents of today\u2019s immigration bill say that law gave away the farm -- it granted amnesty and failed to button down the border -- and they don\u2019t want to see history repeat itself.\n\nThis was the main argument from Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in a Fox News interview. On \u00a0the day a key amendment passed a crucial Senate vote, Cruz warned that the bill \"has immediate legalization ... and the border security is sometime in the future, and just like in 1986, it's designed never to come into being.\"\n\nCruz and the Senate Republican leadership say the border must be able to keep people out before those who are here without documents are given any path to legal status. To do otherwise, they argue, would only invite a flood of unauthorized immigration.\n\nWe\u2019ll examine both parts of Cruz\u2019s statement. Does legalization come before the border is secure? And is border security treated as it was in the 1986 law and \"designed to never come to pass\"?\n\nDefining legalization\n\nThe matter of when legalization happens is relatively easy to resolve, although we found two different meanings to the word. For some, such as Cruz, it means any formal status that allows a person to stay and work in the U.S., even temporarily. For others, it means permanent legal residency, often referred to as a green card.\n\nThe Senate bill, grants what it calls \"registered provisional immigrant\" status, or RPI. This is not a green card granting permanent legal status; but it does mean a person has passed a criminal record check, paid a fine, and met other requirements. With provisional status, a person can stay and work for at least six years. However, under an amendment crafted by John Hoeven, R-N.D., and Bob Corker, R- Tenn., no one can apply for that until the Department of Homeland Security puts together and launches a border control plan (formally called the Comprehensive Southern Border Security Strategy and the Southern Border Fencing Strategy). There\u2019s also a similar status for agricultural workers called a blue card.\n\nIs either status legalization? Cruz would certainly say yes. More important, so does the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the analytic arm of Congress. The CBO\u2019s assessment of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, the bill\u2019s formal title, tallies the number of people expected to qualify under the new rules. In one table, it lists legalization programs and under that are the provisional status (RPI) and the blue card.\n\nWe checked with the CBO and there is no mistake. The provisional status and the blue card are legalization in the eyes of the CBO. We also contacted the Migration Policy Institute, a group that studies population movements worldwide. The institute defines legalization the same way as the CBO. Supporters of immigration reform often focus on the rules and timing for getting a green card and consider that to be legalization, but the CBO definition carries great weight in this debate.\n\nGetting back to the bill, a border security plan must be underway before people can begin to apply, but that security plan need not be completed. The CBO estimates the application process wouldn\u2019t begin until sometime in fiscal year 2015, but it would come before all border tightening measures are in place.\n\nHardening the border\n\nIf Cruz had stopped with legalization, he would have been on more solid ground, but he went further and said the Senate bill neglects border security. He said it was like the 1986 reform act, and he went so far as to say it was \"designed\" to lead to nowhere.\n\nWe asked Cruz\u2019s office for specific supporting evidence. Spokeswoman Catherine Frazier noted several deficiencies in the Hoeven-Corker amendment, including that it fails to require a biometric system -- such as a retina scan -- for monitoring people as they enter and leave the country. But even more fundamental is the timing in the legislation.\n\n"}

Claire McCaskill issued a\u00a0news release\u00a0urging president Trump to address the issue of steel dumping.\n\n\nMcCaskill backed up her comments by saying, \"Due to the recent downturn in steel production, more than 13,600 Americans have been laid off and the steel industry is facing billions in losses.\"\n\n\nThose are some big numbers McCaskill threw out there, so we set out to see if they were accurate. What we found may be worse than what McCaskill originally thought.\n\n\nJobs are going away\n\n\nThe first part of Sen. McCaskill\u2019s statement, \"More than 13,600 Americans have been laid off,\" is accurate. When PolitiFact Missouri asked McCaskill\u2019s office for the supporting data, her press secretary offered a spreadsheet from the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 website tracking the amount of steel mill jobs on a monthly basis.\n\n\nHer press secretary said the 13,600 figure was between January 2015 and May 2016.\n\n\nIn January 2015, 153,500 Americans were employed in steel mills. By May 2016, that number had fallen to 139,900.\n\n\nBut it\u2019s important to note that the loss of steel jobs in America isn\u2019t a recent trend. In fact, more than 20,000 steel jobs have been lost in the U.S. since the start of 2007. Historical data paint a grim picture of the state of steel jobs in America.\n\n\nAccording to the BLS, all \"primary metals\" jobs have dropped from 688,000 in 1990 to just 379,000 by March of 2017. In other words, in the past 27 years, nearly half of the metal-related jobs in America have been eliminated.\n\n"}

This data enabled us to rank-order these jurisdictions based on two commonly used measurements -- median income, and percentage of the population in poverty.\nAs for determining whether a state is \"red\" or \"blue,\" we decided to define it by whether the state voted for President Barack Obama or Mitt Romney in 2012. This means we counted North Carolina and Indiana as red states, since Obama lost them in 2012 after winning them in 2008. (Though either way, the differences would have been marginal.)\nSo how did the data turn out?\nFor median income, we found that 95 of the 100 poorest counties were located in red states.

So we decided to look into it.\nThe bottom line: Trump did try to hire hundreds of foreign workers at his Mar-A-Lago resort in Palm Beach, although it\u2019s unclear just how many actually took jobs. The workers also weren\u2019t necessarily replacing Americans, but filled temporary jobs locals allegedly couldn\u2019t do or didn\u2019t want.\nMar-A-Lago foreign workers\nTrump\u2019s Mar-A-Lago Club in Palm Beach County is an oceanfront eating club designed for the 1 percenters. The club\u2019s website describes itself as offering \"an incomparable, royal lifestyle\" in a historic 126-room mansion. It offers a beach and pool, a spa and fine dining for those who can afford the $100,000 initiation fee.\nThe club\u2019s director of human resources referred us to the campaign for this fact-check, and a campaign spokeswoman did not respond.\nThe charge that Trump hires foreign workers revolves around the club seeking H-2B visas for low-skilled workers such as cooks, wait staff and housekeepers. H-2B visas are legal \u2014 Congress has set the cap at 66,000 per year \u2014 and its agricultural counterpart is the H-2A visa. Nationwide for both programs, the vast majority of the workers are young Mexican men, although news reports say Trump sought workers from Europe.\nEmployers argue they need these temporary workers to fill jobs Americans don\u2019t want, while critics say the workers can be exploited. Since the visas are tied to a particular job, the foreigners can\u2019t simply jump ship for a better paying job at another resort, and unlike Americans, they may be reluctant to raise any complaints with their employers.\nSince 2010, nearly 300 U.S. residents applied or were referred for jobs at Mar-A-Lago, but only 17 were hired, the New York Times reported. Meanwhile, Mar-A-Lago sought more than 500 visas for foreign workers. (The visas were also sought at some of his other properties.) We don\u2019t know how many people actually used the visas and became employees. A spokesman for the State Department said that information is kept confidential.\nTo obtain the visas, businesses must prove they tried but couldn\u2019t fill positions with Americans or legal residents. According to the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, the resort posted jobs through CareerSource Florida, the local workforce development boards throughout the state.\nA U.S. Labor Department spokesman told PolitiFact Florida that 93 people applied for 250 seasonal job openings. Four were hired, while 79 didn\u2019t answer interview requests or turned down jobs (10 applications were classified with unknown status).\nDocuments the resort later filed with the Labor Department showed that many of the American applicants weren\u2019t hired because they didn\u2019t meet requirements. Some applicants didn\u2019t want to work split shifts, or didn\u2019t have enough experience. Many wanted full-time jobs instead of part\u00a0time, or didn\u2019t respond when the resort contacted them.

We will summarize Zuckoff\u2019s comments from an earlier fact-check:\n\u2022\u00a0\"First, in the case of Social Security, no one is being misled,\" Zuckoff wrote in a January 2009 article in Fortune. \"Social Security is exactly what it claims to be: A mandatory transfer payment system under which current workers are taxed on their incomes to pay benefits, with no promises of huge returns.\"\n\u2022\u00a0Second, he wrote, \"A Ponzi scheme is unsustainable because the number of potential investors is eventually exhausted.\" While Social Security faces a huge burden due to retiring Baby Boomers, it can be and has been tweaked, and \"the government could change benefit formulas or take other steps, like increasing taxes, to keep the system from failing.\"\n\u2022\u00a0Third, Zuckoff wrote, \"Social Security is morally the polar opposite of a Ponzi scheme.\u00a0...\u00a0At the height of the Great Depression, our society (see 'Social') resolved to create a safety net (see 'Security') in the form of a social insurance policy that would pay modest benefits to retirees, the disabled and the survivors of deceased workers. By design, that means a certain amount of wealth transfer, with richer workers subsidizing poorer ones. That might rankle, but it's not fraud.\"\nMichael Tanner, an expert on Social Security at the libertarian Cato Institute says that Social Security and Ponzi schemes share some characteristics -- for example, in the early stages there is a huge windfall while those later on get smaller returns.\n\n"}

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Bill Nelson Says Connie Mack IV has been \"a promoter for Hooters with a history of bar room brawling, altercations and road rage.\"", "evidence": "The primary isn\u2019t over yet, but Bill Nelson expects his general election rival for U.S. Senate will be Connie Mack IV, and he\u2019s launched his first statewide ad attacking his rival.\n\nNelson, the Democratic incumbent, released the ad against Mack, a Republican congressman from Fort Myers, on Aug. 2. It seeks to paint Mack as a brawling incompetent.\n\nNarrator: \"Florida, meet Connie Mack IV. A promoter for Hooters with a history of bar room brawling, altercations and road rage. A big spender with a trail of debts, liens and unpaid bills. He has one of the worst attendance records in Congress this year but he still voted to end Medicare as we know it. Questionable work habits. A sense of entitlement. Connie Mack, he thinks the rules are different for him.\"\n\nThat echoes some online attacks by Mack\u2019s Republican primary opponent George LeMieux, who dropped out of the race in June because of Mack\u2019s overwhelming lead in the polls and fundraising.\n\nLeMieux claimed that Mack\u2019s only \"real job in the real world\" was an events coordinator for Hooters. We ruled that Mostly False because Mack had some additional private sector jobs including selling fitness equipment. PolitiFact Florida also recently checked a claim by another Mack Republican rival, former U.S. Rep. Dave Weldon, that Mack missed \"almost half\" his votes in Congress this year. We rated that Mostly False. Though Mack had missed votes, he had not missed that many.\n\nIn this report, we will briefly review Mack\u2019s Hooters-related job and whether he had a \"history of bar room brawling, altercations and road rage.\"\n\nMack\u2019s work for Hooters\n\nMack campaign spokesman David James told us for our previous fact check about Hooters that Mack was a marketing executive for LTP Management from 1994 to 2000. The company owned and operated several Hooters franchises in Florida, as well as Dan Marino's Town Tavern and Lulu's Bait Shack.\n\nMack never received a paycheck directly from Hooters, but \"we never denied he worked on behalf of Hooters,\" James said.\n\nHooters has often been mentioned in articles throughout Mack\u2019s political career, which started with a state House seat he won in 2000. He won his first congressional race in 2004.\n\nA 2000 Palm Beach Post article quipped: \"When he announced his candidacy in November, he mentioned his \u2018broad business experience\u2019 - surely an unintentional pun.\" The Tampa Bay Times The Buzz blog recently posted Mack\u2019s Hooters business card.\n\nNelson\u2019s ad cited a 2012 POLITICO blog headline: \"Connie Mack\u2019s Hooters connection.\" The blog stated that Mack, his political action committee and his wife U.S. Rep. Mary Bono Mack, R-Calif., received nearly $50,000 in donations from Hooters management during their time in office.\n\nOur one criticism about this part of the ad is that Nelson didn\u2019t make it clear that Mack\u2019s Hooters-related work ended more than a decade ago. Calling Mack \"a promoter for Hooters\" leaves the impression that Mack currently works for Hooters. That isn\u2019t accurate -- he stopped working for LTP management in 2000.\n\n \"A history of bar room brawling, altercations and road rage\"\n\nNow let\u2019s turn to the portion of the ad where the narrator said that Mack had \"a history of bar room brawling, altercations and road rage.\" On the screen the word \"arrest\" also appears.\n\nThe ad cites a March 2012 Associated Press article describing past incidents that occurred in the 1980s and early 1990s when Mack was in his 20s. The Miami Herald also wrote about Mack\u2019s past in February 2012. We will pull from both newspaper articles plus court documents the Miami Herald posted online to summarize these incidents.\n\n1989 nightclub arrest: While at a Jacksonville nightclub called Bananas, Mack, then 22, was arrested by an off-duty Duval County sheriff\u2019s deputy. After Mack or one of his friends was asked to remove his hat (reports conflict on this point), Mack refused and swore at club workers, according to employee testimony. Mack refused to leave and was arrested for resisting an officer without violence.\n\nMack called the arrest a misunderstanding and pleaded no contest. The judge withheld adjudication, meaning he has no criminal record, according to the Herald. The report was sealed by court order. As we'll see, Mack was later involved in litigation that brought the incident to light.\n\n1992 bar brawl: In February 1992, Mack got into a brawl with then-professional baseball player Ron Gant at an Atlanta bar called Calico Jack\u2019s. The Miami Herald reported: \"A waitress testified that Mack, who had been heavily drinking beer and Jagermeister shots all night, took the first swing at Gant. Mack testified he couldn\u2019t remember how much beer he drank, but said he had only one liquor shot \u2014 of tequila. Gant claims a drunken Mack repeatedly bumped into him, precipitating a fight. Mack claims Gant attacked him for no reason. During the melee, Gant head-locked Mack. Mack testified that he couldn\u2019t breath. So he starting striking and grabbing the ball player\u2019s crotch. At a certain point, the club\u2019s bouncers got involved and Mack broke his ankle. He sued Gant, who was held liable. But a jury awarded no damages.\" (Here is a court document in which Mack describes that incident at length.)\n\nLate 1980s road rage incidents: The road rage incidents came to light in a 1996 deposition involving the Gant case. Here is how Mack described them: In one incident, which Mack placed around 1987 or 1988, Mack and a girlfriend were driving to Cape Coral when he said a man tried to run them off the road after he thought that Mack\u2019s girlfriend had cut in front of him. She drove off the road into a ditch, and Mack and the other man got out. \"He attempted a swing at me, and I swung back and hit him...\" Mack testified. Mack said he then headed back to his car and the other man, wielding a bat, chased him, tried to hit him and then smashed the windows of Mack\u2019s car.\n\nIn the other incident, which Mack placed around 1987, occurred in West Palm Beach when he was in a car with friends and stopped at a draw bridge. The guys in Mack\u2019s car had just watched a Howie Mandel video, and one of the guys in the car was \"in the back screaming like Howie Mandel.\" A man in another car apparently got upset. Mack got out of his car, and the other man got out of his car and jumped on top of Mack.\n\nMack said he later received a phone call from a police sergeant who said someone wanted to press charges but that he never heard anything about it again.\n\nWe don\u2019t have a full account of the road rage incidents -- the Associated Press wrote that court records in the Gant civil suit didn\u2019t include testimony from the other people involved. And there were conflicting accounts in the Jacksonville and Atlanta brawls. For example, in the Gant fight a waitress said Mack bought about 20 pitchers of beer and rounds of shots over five hours and was drunk, while Mack said he felt no effect from two to four beers and one shot over two hours, according to the Associated Press.\n\nMack\u2019s response\n\nFor this article we asked James, Mack\u2019s campaign spokesman, if he had anything he wanted us to review. James told us in an email that \"all of this is very important as PolitiFact found all of this stuff false or mostly false in the spring when LeMieux did it.\"\n\nA Mack spokesman previously told the Miami Herald as for Mack\u2019s past brawls that Mack was \"young and foolish\" at that time.\n\nOur ruling\n\nNelson told TV viewers across the state: \"Florida, meet Connie Mack IV. A promoter for Hooters with a history of bar room brawling, altercations and road rage.\" The word \"arrest\" appeared during the ad.\n\nMuch of that statement is true, but there are some key omissions:\n\n\u2022 Nelson failed to make it clear that Mack stopped working as a promoter for Hooters 12 years ago.\n\n\u2022 Nelson omitted the timeline on the criminal history and road rage: Those incidents occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Mack was in 20s at the time. He\u2019s now about to turn 45.\n\n\u2022 We have an incomplete picture of the road rage incidents, making it difficult to discern how much Mack was to blame.\n\nBut Mack did work as a promoter for Hooters and has a history of bar room brawling, altercations and road rage"}

They purr. They play with yarn. We tease them with laser pointers. Who knew the males of the species were lean, mean reproductive machines?\n\nThat's what we learned from a Jan. 28 news release from the Central Falls Police Department that announced a $30,000 animal control grant intended to help low-income pet owners keep the cat population down through spaying and neutering.\n\n\"Statistics show one male cat can father 420,000 kittens in just five years,\" the release says.\n\nUsually, when we see a statement we'd like to check, we ask, \"Is that true?\"\n\nIn this case we asked, \"Is that even possible?\"\n\nWe rushed to our calculator.\n\nFive years is 1,827 days (counting leap years).\n\nThe typical number of kittens in a litter is four.\n\nThat means the male cat would have to find and successfully inseminate 57 females per day to create that many kittens over five years.\n\n\"He would be a very busy boy,\" joked Central Falls police Capt. Steven Bradley, listed as the contact person on the news release, after we told him what the numbers revealed. \"Maybe he's got a line on some good catnip.\"\n\nAnd steroids!\n\nSo clearly the math shows the statement is wrong.\n\nBradley said the statistic came from Rita Falaguerra of Cat Adoption Team Services, which secured the grant.\n\nFalaguerra said she stands by the statistic because it came from the state veterinarian, Peter Belinsky.\n\nBelinsky said she may have seen it as a pamphlet posted in his examination room which said 400,000 cats could come from one pair of cats over seven years under ideal conditions.\n\n\"I might have quoted it, but that was a long time ago,\" he said, acknowledging that he was not sure if the widely-cited number was true.\n\nWe found the questionable factoid (or differing versions of it) repeated on many pet-lover websites, such as the Pet Health Network, the ASPCA, and in the mainstream media. (The Journal repeated it on Jan. 29 and a day earlier on its website.)\n\nMost often, the claims involve the reproduction potential of female cats, not male. The amount of time deemed necessary varies from five to seven years, depending on who is talking.\n\nSo what's the real story?\n\nBelinsky also cited a 1993 article published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Like many similar claims, it offers numbers based on raw mathematical population growth and does not factor real life into the equation.\n\nIt said that if all the cats remain healthy and get enough nutrition, with no premature deaths, and each female produces eight kittens per year, it\u2019s theoretically possible that 174,760 cats could descend from a single female after seven years.\n\nThat statistic is also quoted frequently. But it assumes that females are only fertile for one year. If all the females remain fertile indefinitely, the paper says, there would be 781,250 cats after seven years.\n\nWe checked the calculations. They turned out to be off. It would take eight years, not seven, to reach either number.\n\nAfter five years, the timeframe we're looking at, the cat population would be 2,729 if female fertility lasted one year and 6,249 if all the females remained fertile. That's a far cry -- or should we say meow -- from 420,000.\n\nBelinsky said even those lower numbers are unrealistic, especially when you're talking about cats in the wild.\n\n\"You've got predation, you've got toxins, you\u2019ve got infectious disease, and they don't live more than a year or two in the wild, so this would be under ideal conditions,\" Belinsky said.\n\nA more reasonable estimate for feral cats, he said, would be roughly 1.8 surviving cats for every female per year. At that rate, we calculated, you would have perhaps 49 cats alive after five years.\n\nAs it turns out, the 420,000 statistic has been debunked in articles going back a few years. The Wall Street Journal shot it down in 2006. The San Francisco Chronicle did so in 2010.\n\nWhere does it come from? The website HumaneWatch.org says it found the Humane Society of the United States using it in a news release in 1989. Whatever the source, the fallacious feline factoid has nine lives -- if not more -- among pet enthusiasts.\n\n\"That's the craziness of all these quotes,\" said Belinsky. \"They're not derived from actually following the animals in the wild or under a controlled experiment. They just extrapolate based on math and best guess.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nCentral Falls police, citing a cat adoption service, said, \"Statistics show one male cat can father 420,000 kittens in five years.\"\n\nIn the real world, that's impossible.\n\nThe idea that one female cat and her succeeding generations could produce that many cats in half a decade is just as ridiculous.\n\nThere are overwhelmingly good reasons to have a cat spayed or neutered.\n\nTrying to prevent a single male cat from producing more than 400,000 offspring in five years isn't one of them.\n\nWe rate this cat stat Pants on Fire!\n\n(If you have a claim you\u2019d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com.

I think Donald Trump himself contributed $100,000 to the foundation,\" he said.\nPlouffe is right that Trump gave at least $100,000 to the foundation, a fact that Trump and his campaign readily admit. One caveat: It appears that the money came through Trump\u2019s own foundation, not directly from Trump.\nThe Clinton Foundation lists Donald J. Trump as a contributor with a cumulative lifetime donation amount between $100,001 to $250,000. It\u2019s not clear if Trump himself made a personal contribution, but tax forms show that the Donald J.

Most of its 300,000 donors (85.5 percent) gave less than $250.\nBreaking it down by dollar amount, however, Trump\u2019s total contribution isn\u2019t that big.

Then Restore our Future, which is run by Romney supporters, attacked Gingrich for some his previous positions. (Super PACs operate outside of official campaigns and don\u2019t have to follow the same rules.)\n\n\"Newt Gingrich\u2019s attacks are called 'foolish,' 'out of bounds,' and 'disgusting.' Newt attacks because he has more baggage than the airlines,\" says the ad, which is running in Florida and South Carolina.\n\n\"Newt was fined $300,000 for ethics violations, took $1.6 million from Freddie Mac, and co-sponsored a bill with Nancy Pelosi that would have given $60 million a year to a U.N. program supporting China\u2019s brutal one-child policy.\"\n\n\"Don\u2019t be fooled by Newt\u2019s desperate attacks,\" the ad concludes.\n\nThe ad is right that Gingrich was fined $300,000 for ethics violations. Gingrich also concedes that he advised Freddie Mac. (Bloomberg reported he was paid $1.6 million, but that specific amount rests on unnamed sources.)\n\nHere, we wanted to fact-check whether Gingrich \"co-sponsored a bill with Nancy Pelosi that would have given $60 million a year to a U.N. program supporting China\u2019s brutal one-child policy.\"\n\nFor its evidence, the ad points to H.R. 1078, from Feb. 22, 1989. We went to the archives to check on the bill\u2019s details.\n\nThe bill in question was called the Global Warming Prevention Act of 1989. It set national goals to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and encouraged international agreements to address global warming. It required the U.S. Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency to monitor global warming and create plans for future action. It supported stricter fuel standards for cars and alternative energy. It also sent money to developing countries to encourage practices that reduce carbon emissions. (See our fact-check of how Gingrich's statements on global warming and cap-and-trade policies have changed over the years.)\n\nThe bill had several hearings, but received unfavorable reviews from the George H.W. Bush administration and never became law.\n\nGetting back to the ad\u2019s specific claims, it says that Gingrich co-sponsored the bill with Nancy Pelosi. The bill\u2019s primary sponsor was Rep. Claudine Schneider, R-R.I. It\u2019s true that both Gingrich and Pelosi were co-sponsors. But the bill had 144 co-sponsors, roughly a third of the U.S. House of Representatives. (Gingrich was not speaker at this time; Democrats still held the majority.) Congressional records indicate Pelosi signed onto the bill the day it was introduced, while close to four months passed before Gingrich signed on as a co-sponsor.\u00a0\n\nNext, the ad says the bill \"would have given $60 million a year to a UN program supporting China\u2019s brutal one-child policy.\" China\u2019s one-child policy generally refers to the government\u2019s efforts to limit population growth to one child per couple. Human rights advocates say the policy has resulted in forced sterilizations and abortions. \u00a0\n\nThe Restore our Future website says the $60 million went to the United Nations Population Fund and that President Ronald Reagan withheld funds from the program after he determined the program, which supports family planning and contraception, was supporting Chinese actions.\n\nWe won\u2019t attempt to relitigate here whether the United Nations Population Fund supported Chinese policy, because we soon found evidence that the bill\u2019s authors did not support those policies.\n\nIn the same section that authorizes funding, there\u2019s this stipulation: \"None of the funds authorized by this section may be used to pay for the performance of involuntary sterilization or abortion or to coerce any person to accept family planning.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\n"}
{"label": "false", "claim": "Chain email \"The Congressional Budget Office -- supposedly non-partisan -- estimates that in just a few years the average cost to every family of four (from cap and trade) will be $6,800 per year.\"", "evidence": "Critics of the Democratic cap-and-trade proposal have many complaints about the plan, but their biggest is cost. They say it will cost so much that it will be a significant burden on a typical American family.\n\nThe latest variation of this comes in a chain e-mail that contends the cap-and-trade plan will require more energy-efficient homes (a claim we rated  Pants on Fire  ). The e-mail says, \"The Congressional Budget Office -- supposedly non-partisan -- estimates that in just a few years the average cost to every family of four will be $6,800 per year. No one is excluded.\"\n\nWe've spent a lot of time  looking into claims  about how much the cap-and-trade plan could cost families, and one thing's for certain: There's no consensus. The Environmental Protection Agency says it could cost as little as $80 per year while the conservative Heritage Foundation says it could cost as much as $1,241 annually in higher energy bills.\n\nWe've explained the pros and cons of the various estimates in those previous items, so here we're going to look into the chain e-mail's claim that the CBO estimates cap-and-trade will cost a family of four $6,800 a year.\n\nThe bill in question is called the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009. It is sponsored by Henry Waxman of California and Edward Markey of Massachusetts, and aims to reduce carbon emissions 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Companies, particularly utilities, would have to either buy pollution credits or adopt cleaner technology.\n\nCritics say that either way, the cost of energy will go up, and that cost will be passed on to the consumer.\n\nThe CBO is a key player because it is a widely respected nonpartisan branch of Congress that calculates cost estimates. In June 2009, the CBO released an analysis of the House bill, saying that the economywide cost of the cap-and-trade program in 2020 would be $22 billion -- or about $175 per household. The individual cost would vary depending on your wealth. Low-income consumers could expect to save $40 a year because of credits from utilities, while high-income consumers would see a net cost for energy of $235 to $340 annually. It's also important to note that the costs are expected to vary year to year because of the way the law would be phased in. The CBO chose 2020 as a milestone for its analysis because it's a point at which the program would have been in effect for eight years, giving the economy and polluters time to adjust. But had the CBO chosen a later date, the cost per family may have been higher because the government would gradually be charging polluters more.\n\nWe traced the $6,800 estimate back to a report from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that has been very critical of the cap-and-trade plan. In the report, the group criticizes the CBO for failing to consider the harm that the cap-and-trade plan could do to the economy. The conservative group says the law could cause companies to produce less, which would reduce the GDP in 2020 by $161 billion in 2009 dollars. By 2035, it would be $650 billion lower, which works out to about $6,800 per family of four per year.\n\nSo the chain e-mail has taken the estimate from a conservative think tank and falsely attributed it to the CBO, a nonpartisan branch of Congress. There are many legitimate questions that can be raised about the cost of cap-and-trade, but it's simply incorrect to say the CBO came up with the $6,800 figure"}

{"label": "true", "claim": "Mike Haridopolos \"Whether you like to admit it or not, half our general revenue goes to education.\"", "evidence": "A budget storm is brewing in Tallahassee, and Senate President Mike Haridopolos is making clear that no agency, program or area may be spared from impending cuts.\n\nHaridopolos, R-Merritt Island, met with reporters on Jan. 12, 2011, to offer his outlook regarding Florida's $3.62 billion budget shortfall for the coming fiscal year. Haridopolos predicted that it would be difficult to pursue any significant tax cuts -- like those being championed by Gov. Rick Scott -- and that everyone should expect spending cuts.\n\nThat includes education funding, he warned.\n\nMore than $3 billion in federal stimulus funds have helped the state fill education budget holes for the past two years, but those funds sunset this spring. And while some additional federal funds are coming available, about $555 million, Florida's budget picture remains bleak, Haridopolos said.\n\n\"Whether you like to admit it or not, half our general revenue goes to education,\" Haridopolos was quoted as saying in the Orlando Sentinel. \"It's a very difficult spot to be in, and the reason we wanted to make the adjustments to the class-size amendment\" defeated by voters in November. Haridopolos was referring to an amendment proposed by the Legislature to ease class-size requirements at Florida schools so the state could save money. That measure failed to receive the needed 60 percent voter approval to pass.\n\nFor this fact check, we decided to zero in on Haridopolos' claim that half of state general revenue goes to fund education.\n\nUnderstanding the state budget and education funding\n\nIn his claim, Haridopolos is talking about a subset of the state budget, which is a subset of state's share of education funding in Florida, which is a subset of overall education funding in Florida. Oh, and he's not just talking about K-12 spending, but also state spending on the state university system, pre-Kindergarten and student aid programs.\n\nWe'll walk you through it.\n\nLet's start with the state budget, which you can imagine by picturing a three-legged stool.\n\nLeg one: General revenue (what Haridopolos is talking about). General revenue makes up about 34 percent of the current state budget. The money mostly comes from sales taxes -- though some comes from telephone and cable taxes, corporate income taxes (which Scott has vowed to phase out), and taxes on property transactions. The state has broad discretion on how general revenue is spent.\n\nLeg two: State trust funds. State trust funds make up about 27 percent of the current state budget. That is money collected by the state to be used for a specific purpose. The state gas tax is funneled into a transportation trust fund, for example, to pay for road building projects. Florida Lottery proceeds roll into the Educational Enhancement Trust Fund. (The Legislature, at times, has raided trust funds to help balance the budget.)\n\nLeg three: Federal dollars. Federal dollars this year comprise about 39 percent of the state budget. Federal dollars primarily fund the state's Medicaid program, but also help fund education, road projects and the criminal justice system.\n\nSo while each leg helps fund education programs from pre-K through college, Haridopolos is focusing on the general revenue fund. In the current budget, 56 percent of all state education spending came out of general revenue, and it's the portion of state spending the Legislature can most easily control.\n\nNow, here's a second important primer.\n\nThe state doesn't fund education all by itself. Hardly. Local school districts contribute billions of dollars on their own through local property taxes. Most of those property taxes, believe it or not, are set at rates mandated by the Legislature through something called the Required Local Effort. In short, school districts are forced to collect the amount of property taxes the Legislature decides, or the districts won't get to share in state funding.\n\nIn addition, there are other property taxes individual school districts have discretion over. None of those funds are technically state revenues for the purpose of this analysis.\n\nIf this isn't confusing enough already, the context of Haridopolos' statement also is important. He's talking about potential cuts in education funding because of less federal dollars and lower sales tax receipts that are affecting the state's bottom line. One way to offset those cuts would be to raise the Required Local Effort, but the Republican-led Legislature that sets the tax has been opposed to that idea.\n\nDrilling down on general revenue\n\nNow, sticking to Haridopolos' statement and examining only general revenue, the Senate president is correct.\n\nOf the $23.8 billion of general revenue budgeted to be spent between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2011, $12.5 billion was directed to education -- pre-K through college.\n\nDivide one into the other and you see that education spending currently equals more than 52 percent of general revenue. You can see the full breakdown of general revenue spending on Page 5 of this report.\n\nHaridopolos spokesman David Bishop said the state expects to receive $22.6 billion in general revenue for the 2011-2012 fiscal year.\n\nIf you look at the overall state budget, education funding made up about 32 percent ($22.4 billion) of the entire $70 billion state budget in 2010-2011.\n\n"}

He specifically mentioned helping, as mayor, to resolve the city's bitter teachers dispute in the 1990s.\n\nWhen his Democratic opponent, Frank Caprio, was asked the same question, his first reaction was to attack Chafee.\n\n\"When Linc Chafee says look at his record, you talk about opening up the checkbook and giving the unions a blank check. He settled a union strike by giving the teachers a 19-percent raise. So I don't think looking at the record makes anybody feel too comfortable tonight,\" he said.\n\nNineteen percent sounds like a big increase, especially in an era when many workers are taking pay cuts, so we decided to look back at what actually happened.\n\nIn September 1991, before Chafee was elected mayor, Warwick teachers went on strike when their contract expired. The action delayed school for a week. Teachers returned to the classroom after union leaders said they had reached a tentative agreement with the School Committee, but the deal fell through in a dispute over what each side had actually agreed to.\n\nThe case went to the State Labor Relations Board and was still simmering the following September, when the teachers went on strike again. Eighteen teachers were briefly sent to the ACI for refusing to obey a judge's back-to-work order.\n\nTeachers continued to work without a contract and without a pay increase, but they refused to perform extra duties, such as advising student groups, taking students on field trips or meeting with parents outside school hours.\n\nThe dispute became so disruptive, some parents were putting houses up for sale to get out of the school system, according to Providence Journal accounts at the time.\n\nChafee inherited the dispute in its third year when he became mayor in 1993. At one point, he threatened to take the money set aside for teacher pay increases and use it to cut property taxes unless the union and the School Committee resolved the dispute. \"I'm sure a tax decrease will spur some economic development here,\" he said.\n\nIn spring 1994, after talks broke down and the state mediator resigned in frustration, Chafee stepped in and cut a deal with the teachers, essentially bypassing the School Committee.\n\nUnder the agreement, backed by eight of the nine members of the Democrat-controlled City Council, base pay for a top-step teacher went from $39,762 during the 1990-1991 school year to $49,371 for 1996-'97, the final year of the pact. That's a 24.2-percent hike. The deal also included an extra 2.5 percent that teachers who were working during the 1992-'93 school year are entitled to receive when they retire or resign, a bonus that continues to be paid as teachers leave.\n\nSo Caprio's 19-percent claim actually understates the total pay increase the teachers received. (The Chafee campaign has asserted the overall increase was 19.4 percent, the figure that had been reported at the time of the settlement.)\n\nBut Caprio leaves out an important bit of information: the agreement covered six years, running through August 1997.\n\nWe asked the Caprio campaign if the candidate thought the six-year time span was relevant. \"I think what's relevant is that the raise was given,\" said spokesman Nick Hemond.\n\nBut we think it's crucial. After all, we would hope that if Caprio, as Rhode Island's state treasurer, was promised a rate of return of 20 percent, he would want to know if the 20 percent was over one year, or 20.\n\nIn the Warwick case, the compounded cost of the salary increases was the same as if the School Committee had awarded 3.67 percent raises during each of the six years of the settlement.\n\nAnd there's another question of context.\n\nAnnual raises such as those may seem high in this economic climate, but the 1990s was a different era.\n\nAt the time Chafee reached the deal, the cost of living as measured by the U.S. Consumer Price Index had increased by 23.6 percent during the previous six years.\n\nAnd according to data from the Rhode Island affiliates of the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers,\u00a0 the average teacher salary in the state increased by 3.7 percent for the 1993-'94 school year, with 14 school systems giving out raises of 5 percent or higher.\n\nTo reach a ruling, we focused on three key points:\n\nCaprio understated the teachers' overall pay increase and incorrectly said the settlement came during a strike. But his intended message -- that Chafee was overly generous to the teachers -- was clear.\n\nHe ignored the economic context of the era -- and the turmoil in the city's schools -- when the deal was reached.\n\nAnd he neglected to mention that the teachers' agreement covered six years, which we consider a significant\u00a0 omission"}

Trump outlined his latest immigration plan a year later, on Aug. 31 in Arizona. His 10-point plan did not call for deporting 16 million people or ending birthright citizenship. He emphasized that he wanted to deport 2 million \"criminal aliens.\"\nTrump\u2019s \u2018deportation force\u2019 days\nKaine\u2019s comments aren\u2019t unfounded.\nTrump has not been consistent on immigration throughout his campaign.\nIn that same Arizona speech, Trump talked about the broader undocumented population having to leave first in order to come back: \"Those here illegally today, who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and one route only: To return home and apply for re-entry like everybody else.\"\nClinton\u2019s campaign pointed out a line in that speech where he said \"anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation.\"\nLeading up to the primaries, Trump said he wanted undocumented families to stay together, but \"they have to go.\"\nIn a September 2015 interview on 60 Minutes, Scott Pelley asked Trump what he would do with 11 million immigrants in the United States illegally. \"If they've done well, they're going out and they're coming back in legally ... We're rounding 'em up in a very humane way, in a very nice way,\" Trump said.\nIn November 2015, a day after one of the Republican primary debates, Joe Scarborough of MSNBC asked Trump, \"How do you deport 12 million illegal immigrants?\"\n\"You do it. You do it. Because they're here illegally, you do it,\" Trump responded.\nIn that same interview, he said, \"you\u2019re going to have a deportation force, and you\u2019re going to do it humanely.\"\nBirthright citizenship\nSo Trump has talked extensively about deporting the undocumented population, some faster than others. But that doesn\u2019t mean he necessarily wants to deport their U.S.-born children.\nTrump hasn\u2019t talked about birthright citizenship and \"anchor babies\" much since the heyday of the GOP primary. In November, Trump said a constitutional amendment would not be needed to deal with the citizenship of children born in the United States to undocumented parents.\n\"You need an act of Congress. You don't have to go through a new amendment or anything, a new constitutional amendment,\" Trump said November 2015 in an MSNBC interview. \"But anchor babies.

Not so, writes Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and liberal op-ed columnist for the New York Times.\n\nIn his Jan. 6, 2011 column, titled \"the Texas Omen,\" Krugman opines that the Texas-style \"modern conservative theory of budgeting\" ain\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be, now that fiscal reality has intruded. Though he notes that \"comparing budget crises among states is tricky,\" Krugman does just that, writing that \"data from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities suggest that the Texas budget gap is worse than New York\u2019s, about as bad as California\u2019s, but not quite up to New Jersey levels.\"\n\nWe wondered if Krugman\u2019s comparison was on target. In response, he pointed us to a table in a Dec. 16, 2010 report by the Washington-based center, which studies the impact of state and federal budget decisions on low-income Americans. The report, headlined \"States Continue to Feel Recession\u2019s Impact,\" says the national recession has caused the steepest decline in tax receipts on record, resulting in \"a state fiscal crisis of unprecedented severity.\"\n\nTable 3 in the report lists nearly every state confronting a projected fiscal 2012 budget shortfall and compares each shortfall to the state\u2019s fiscal 2011 budget. The table says Texas faces a $10 billion shortfall, amounting to 22.3 percent of its 2011 budget. The New York budget gap equals $9 billion, 9 percent of its 2011 budget, while the expected gaps for California and New Jersey equal $19.2 billion (22.2 percent) and $10.5 billion (37.4 percent), respectively, of each state\u2019s 2011 budget.\n\nSo, the 2012 Texas shortfall appeared to be worse than New York\u2019s, about as bad as California\u2019s, but not quite up--actually, hardly close--to New Jersey\u2019s level.\n\nThe report says the center\u2019s sources for the Texas breakdown includes an analysis of state agency budget requests and other information by the Austin-based Center on Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for programs that serve low-income Texans. The two similarly-named organizations occasionally collaborate on projects.\n\nWe called Eva DeLuna-Castro, the Austin center\u2019s senior budget analyst, who said the shortfall figure cited for Texas reflected her earlier research indicating that the state would need about $20 billion in additional revenue to extend current programs and services through 2012-13. One year\u2019s worth of the shortfall estimate is $10 billion. DeLuna-Castro noted that at the time of the Washington center\u2019s research, Texas state government expected to spend $45 billion in fiscal 2011, a figure since reduced to $42.6 billion to account for agencies\u2019 spending cuts last year.\n\nDeLuna-Castro said she has studied the California shortfall projection and thinks the Washington center\u2019s research is solid there. She said she hasn\u2019t studied projected shortfalls for New York or New Jersey. Finally, she cautioned that comparisons might overlook the fact that Texas lawmakers could tap billions of dollars in the state\u2019s rainy day fund. She said other states, which budget annually, may have already dug into such funds.\n\nThat seems a reasonable point. The Texas rainy day fund could ease the state\u2019s shortfall--a fact not mentioned in Krugman\u2019s column. Then again, tapping the fund requires a two-thirds vote of the GOP-majority Legislature, and some Republican legislators have said the fund is off-limits.\n\nFinally, the lead author of the state-by-state comparison, Elizabeth McNichol, a senior fellow with the Washington center, told us the comparison would soon be updated to reflect increases in projected shortfalls for Texas and California. \"The problem that Texas is facing is on a similar level to these other states,\" McNichol said.\n\nAs we noted recently, the Center for Public Policy Priorities now estimates that Texas needs nearly $27 billion more than the state expects to raise from taxes and other sources to maintain current government services and programs through 2012-13. McNichol told us by e-mail that the Washington center consequently considers the updated 2012 Texas shortfall to be $13.4 billion, equal to nearly 30 percent of the 2011 budget.\n\nAt the time of Krugman\u2019s column, the projected Texas shortfall was nowhere near New Jersey\u2019s level.

Jim DeMint, R-S.C., that \"94 percent of the bills that pass the Senate have no debate, no vote, no amendments, no reading of the bill, no online disclosure, and very often no score from the Congressional Budget office.\" We said that the actual percentage was 27.9 and called it a Pants on Fire. (We've archived our original item here.) We soon received a number of letters from readers critical of the math we had used to come up with the percentage. We also received criticism from DeMint's office, for our math as well as for other issues. As a result, we decided to assign a new reporter to the item in order to take a fresh look. Below is our new analysis.  On May 26, 2010, Sen. Jim DeMint, a Republican from South Carolina, posted a video of one of his speeches on YouTube. Speaking about legislative openness, DeMint said that Congress is plagued with secrecy and lack of debate on important issues: \"At this point in the Senate, 94 percent of all the bills are passed unanimous consent -- 94 percent. So this is hardly a lack of productivity. And what this means is 94 percent of the bills that pass the Senate have no debate, no vote, no amendments, no reading of the bill, no online disclosure, and very often no score from the Congressional Budget office.\"  DeMint's number seemed high to us, so we decided to investigate. We see two broad areas to analyze. One is whether the percentage DeMint cites is accurate. The other is whether DeMint's percentage says anything valuable about how the Senate handles legislation.  We asked DeMint's office for the source of his claim and were told it comes from a July 2008 report from the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan research arm for Congress. The report, which DeMint's office had originally asked CRS to prepare, notes that as of June 30, 2008, the Senate had passed 911 measures of various kinds during the 110th Congress.   Of these measures, 855 were passed via unanimous consent -- an expedited process by which bills are passed unless a senator objects. This is the source of DeMint's 94 percent figure -- 855 bills passed by unanimous consent out of 911 total measures taken up.   DeMint in his speech referred to all of these measures as \"bills.\" But the CRS report broke them down more precisely. Some were formal bills or joint resolutions, both of which are binding. Others were simple resolutions or concurrent resolutions, which do not have the force of a law and do not require the president's signature.  Of the 911 total measures, only 376 were legally binding bills and joint resolutions, according to the CRS report. The rest were simple and concurrent resolutions. Occasionally these non-binding resolutions inspire some controversy, but a look through the full list provided by CRS confirms that the vast majority are ceremonial or symbolic in nature. An example is a resolution \"congratulating Charles County, Maryland, on the occasion of its 350th anniversary.\" Others from the CRS report include:\n\u2022 A resolution commending the University of Nebraska-Lincoln women's volleyball team for winning the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I Women's Volleyball Championship.\n\u2022 A concurrent resolution honoring the memory of Napa Valley winemaker Robert Mondavi.\n\n"}

In Korea, he helped foreign companies invest there and resolve employment issues.\u00a0\nWe reached out to the Jacobs campaign about the ad, and received information regarding McMurray\u2019s involvement with a chamber of commerce when he worked as a lawyer in Korea, as well as a list of news articles that detailed how companies moved operations to Asia, or established new operations there.\u00a0\nThe Jacobs campaign says that in 2011, McMurray was a vice chairman of the Foreign Investment Committee of The American Chamber of Commerce in Korea, which we verified through a document from the chamber. The chamber paid roughly $30,000 to lobby for the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, according to a 2011 U.S. Senate Lobbying Report, provided by Jacobs.\u00a0\nIn their memo on the ad, the GOP campaign also sent articles that stated that the U.S.-Korea trade deal from 2012, supported by the chamber, led to a more than doubling of the U.S. goods trade deficit, according to Reuters, and \"more than 95,000 lost U.S. jobs,\" according to an analysis from the union-backed Economic Policy Institute in 2016. (The White House said in 2018 that the goods trade deficit grew by 75 percent under the 2012 agreement.) The biggest source of the trade deficit was related to car sales, according to Vox in 2018.\u00a0\nThe Jacobs memo also has links to articles about Western New York companies that moved their operations, though many of these moves happened before the trade deal took effect in March 2012, or the work went to countries other than South Korea. These examples included American Axle closing its Cheektowaga plant in 2011, and Ford laying off 150 workers at its Buffalo stamping plant, also in 2011. Also on the list was New Era\u2019s shutdown of its Derby plant in 2019, and its move to manufacturing in China, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Haiti, as well as an operation in Miami. In another example from the memo, New Era opened an office in South Korea around 2013, leading to retail stores there.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Jacobs campaign\u2019s argument is that because McMurray was a co-chair of a committee in the chamber, he had something to do with the chamber\u2019s lobbying activities in favor of the U.S.-Korea trade agreement.\u00a0\n\n"}

{"label": "false", "claim": "Jim Moran Ending federal funding for National Public Radio would jeopardize 9,000 jobs.", "evidence": "U.S. Rep. Jim Moran took to the House floor March 17 to defend National Public Radio.\n\nThe Northern Virginia Democrat\u2019s speech came before the House voted to approve a bill that would strip federal funding from NPR and bar local stations from using their own federal money to buy NPR programs.\n\n\"Most people like their local NPR station; I like mine,\" Moran said. \"...But the funding restrictions put forward in this legislation strike at the heart of these great stations. It will cripple their ability to produce local programming. Eliminating funding for NPR would do little to rein in our national debt. It will not create jobs. In fact, 9,000 would be in jeopardy if this passes.\"\n\nWe wondered if 9,000 jobs would really be put at risk by the bill.\n\nFirst, a word on how funding works for NPR and local affiliates. NPR is an independent media company funded by a variety of sources. Independently owned, non-profit stations around the nation pay a membership fee to join the NPR network and then purchase programs produced by NPR, such as Morning Edition or All Things Considered.\n\nStations also produce their own programs and buy shows from other sources, such as Public Radio International, which produces This American Life, or American Public Media, which produces Marketplace.\n\nNPR says 34 percent of its funding comes from station programming fees and another 22 percent from sponsorships. The company receives about 2 percent of its money from the U.S. government, via the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and grants awarded by other federal departments.\n\nLocal public radio stations, such as Richmond\u2019s WCVE, are endowed by a variety of sources, including funds from the CPB. The radio station shares $1.12 million in federal money with public TV stations in Richmond and Charlottesville, an amount that makes up 14 percent of the budget for the TV and radio stations. Other funds come from the state government, private donations and corporate sponsorships.\n\nStacey Karp, who works for the Association of Public Television Stations, said 21,000 people work in public TV or radio, with about 40 percent, or 8,400, working for NPR or local affiliates. The association and NPR have joined forces during the current debates over public media funding. So Moran is saying Lamborn\u2019s bill puts every single public radio job at risk.\n\nThe bill approved by the House -- and now before the Senate -- was introduced by Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colo. It would remove $5 million in direct federal funding from NPR. It would also forbid stations from using the federal money they get from CPB to buy NPR programming or pay their NPR membership dues.\n\n\"It would require the stations to keep strict accounts and separate those funds,\" said Catherine Mortensen, a spokesperson for Lamborn. She said the money could be spent on maintenance, staff salaries and the production of local programming, as well as any other expenses not related directly to NPR programming.\n\nLocal stations could still use their other funds, such as donations from individuals or corporations, to purchase NPR programs or pay membership fees.\n\nIn the end, the only money actually lost would be the $5 million removed from NPR. According to the company\u2019s audited financial statements, revenue for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 2010 was $184.3 million, up from $148.7 million the prior year. So losing the $5 million would have cost NPR 2.7 percent of its 2010 revenue or 3.4 percent of its 2009 revenue. Neither of those percentages seem like they\u2019d put NPR out of business.\n\nUnder Lamborn\u2019s bill the various member stations would not lose any CPB money; they would just be restricted in its use. So while some dollars might need to be redirected, overall funding for stations should remain unaffected.\n\nMoran could have easily attacked another GOP-sponsored bill that has a far greater potential to put public radio jobs at risk. The House\u2019s proposed budget for the rest of fiscal 2011 eliminated all federal funding for the CPB. The corporation received $420 million in fiscal 2010 fiscal is slated to receive $430 million for this fiscal year.\n\nThe House budget was rejected by the Senate, leading the two chambers and President Barack Obama to compromise on two \"continuing resolutions\" that will keep the federal government operating until April 8.\n\nBut Moran was not referring to the House budget bill in his March 17 speech. He was clearly attacking H.R. 1076, Lamborn\u2019s bill.\n\nLet\u2019s review.\n\nMoran said H.R. 1076, which would strip NPR of federal funding and set certain rules on how public radio stations nationwide could spend federal money, would put 9,000 jobs at risk. He based this on information from NPR, and a spokeswoman for public TV and radio said 8,400 people work in public radio.\n\nBut even if this House-approved bill gets past the Senate and is signed by the president, it would cost NPR a very small fraction of its total budget. And it would not cost local stations any money at all.\n\nWith no dollars lost at local stations, we don\u2019t see why this bill would cause layoffs. And with NPR\u2019s revenues growing each year by amounts far exceeding the $5 million at stake, it would seem jobs should be safe at the parent company. If you take $5 million and divide by the 8,400 jobs supposedly at risk, you get a salary per person of $595. We\u2019re certain NPR pays better than that.\n\nMoran suggested this bill could put every public radio job in America at risk"}

Long of the Judicial Confirmation Network was one of the first to knock\n\nSotomayor's\n\nrecord, saying that she \"has an extremely high rate of her decisions being reversed, indicating that she is far more of a liberal activist than even the current liberal activist Supreme Court.\" Wendy Wright of Concerned Women for America echoed that talking point, saying that\n\nSotomayor's\n\n\"high reversal rate alone should be enough for us to pause and take a good look at her record.\"\n\n\nThen there was this from the Libertarian National Committee: \"\n\nSotomayor\n\nhas had her rulings thrown out by the court a troubling four times.\" We learned pretty quickly that the veracity of this statement depends on a few variables.\n\n\nLet's start by looking at\n\nSotomayor's\n\n11-year tenure on the 2\n\nnd\n\nU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. We found that she has authored hundreds of officially published majority opinions \u2014 the White House puts the exact number at 380 \u2014 and of those, six have been heard by the Supreme Court.\n\n\nThree have been reversed:\n\n\nRiverkeeper\n\nInc. vs. EPA\n\n;\n\nMerrill Lynch vs.\n\nDabit\n\n\n; and\n\n\nMalesko\n\nvs. Correctional Services Corp\n\n. Among the other three cases: The Supreme Court affirmed her ruling in\n\nEmpire\n\nHealthchoice\n\nAssurance Inc. vs. McVeigh\n\n. It affirmed her ruling but but unanimously rejected her reasoning in\n\nKnight vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue\n\n. The sixth case,\n\n\nRicci\n\nvs.\n\nDeStefano\n\n\n, is still pending. So her record so far at the appellate level is three reversals, two upheld and one pending.\n\n\nThere's also her time on the U.S. District Court between 1992 and 1998. One of her rulings,\n\n\nTasini\n\nvs. New York Times,\n\net\n\n\nal.\n\n\n, was reversed by the Supreme Court in 1997. That's how the Libertarian Party gets to its total of four\n\nreversed\n\nopinions.\n\n\nKeep in mind that other Supreme Court justices have seen their share of reversals. For the sake of comparison, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, like Sotomayor, wrote hundreds of majority opinions during his 16-year tenure on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. At least two of those were heard by the\n\nSupreme\n\nCourt and both were reversed:\n\nJo Anne B.\n\nBarnhart\n\n, Commissioner of Social Security, Petitioner vs. Pauline Thomas\n\nand\n\n\nRompilla\n\nvs. Beard\n\n.\n\n\nWe were also caught up by the word \"troubling\" in the Libertarian Party's statement, so we turned to Stephen\n\nWermiel\n\n, a law professor at American University Washington College of Law, for some perspective. In fact, the Supreme Court increasingly has a reputation for reversing most of the approximately 80 cases it hears every term,\n\nWermiel\n\nsaid. Indeed, according to data compiled by\n\nSCOTUSblog\n\n.com, the Supreme Court's reversal rate in 2008 was 85 percent, 61 percent in 2007, and 72 percent in 2006.\n\n\nHaving a case reversed \"is not a badge of shame, or a stigma of stupidity or inferiority,\"\n\nWermiel\n\nsaid. \"It's a sign that reasonable minds had a different approach to the issue.\"\n\n\nTom\n\nGoldstein\n\n, a partner at law firm Akin\n\nGump\n\nand author of\n\nSCOTUSblog\n\n.com, agreed. \"In a career as long as [\n\nSotomayor's\n\n], she's easily in the mainstream,\" compared to the reversal rate of other judges.\n\n\n\"The numbers game is childish,\" said Michael\n\nGreve,\n\na legal scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \"You are dealing with all of six cases. What of it?\" The best way to evaluate\n\nSotomayor\n\n\u2014 or anyone else nominated to the highest court \u2014 is to look at individual opinions, he added.\n\n\nSo the Libertarian Party is correct that\n\nSotomayor\n\nwas reversed four times: three at the appellate level and one at the district court level. But this is out of hundreds of potential cases. Furthermore, the Libertarian Party's implication that four cases represents a high rate of reversal just doesn't hold up. Her record is not far off from another well-known justice, Samuel\n\nAlito\n\n, nor is it at all unusual for the Supreme Court to reverse most of the cases it hears every year, according to legal experts we spoke to"}

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Rand Paul Says Marco Rubio is proposing a new $1 trillion \"welfare program\" in tax credits and \"$1 trillion in new military spending.\"", "evidence": "The word conservative was uttered 18 times during the Fox Business News Republican presidential debate on Nov. 10, 2015.\nThe first 17 references made in the Milwaukee Theatre were done with particular emphasis by U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky. (Ohio Gov. John Kasich used the word once.)\nPaul called himself the only fiscal conservative among the eight candidates on stage -- and made a point to contrast himself with U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, in one of the more contentious exchanges of the night.\nRubio had just defended his proposal to increase a child tax credit when Paul interjected.\n\"We have to decide what is conservative and what isn't conservative. Is it fiscally conservative to have a trillion-dollar expenditure? We're not talking about giving people back their tax money. He's talking about giving people money they didn't pay. It's a welfare transfer payment,\" Paul said of Rubio\u2019s tax credit plan.\n\"So, here's what we have. Is it conservative to have $1 trillion in transfer payments -- a new welfare program that's a refundable tax credit? Add that to Marco's plan for $1 trillion in new military spending, and you get something that looks, to me, not very conservative.\"\nDefending the tax credit and his defense spending proposals, Rubio said \"the family is the most important institution in society and \"the world is a stronger and a better place when the United States is the strongest military power in the world.\"\nBut is Rubio proposing a new $1 trillion \"welfare program\" and \"$1 trillion in new military spending\"? And $1 trillion over what period of time?\nTax credit\nRubio\u2019s tax plan includes creating a new, partially refundable child tax credit of up to $2,500 per child. It is meant to offset income and payroll taxes and is considerably larger than the $1,000 credit that is currently available.\nRefundable tax credits help people at the lower end of the income scale, in that people who are too poor to pay any income tax can get money back from the government.\nPaul\u2019s campaign referred us to a March 2015 analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation of a tax plan proposed in the Senate by Rubio and U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah. That analysis estimated the credit would result in a loss of tax revenue of about $170 billion per year.\nThat\u2019s the equivalent of $1.7 trillion over 10 years -- 10 years being a common time frame for federal budget planning.\nBut it\u2019s worth noting that Paul didn\u2019t say 10 years in making his claim.\nWe\u2019ll note that, unlike the original Rubio-Lee plan, Rubio as a candidate is proposing that the credit would be phased out at higher income levels -- \u00a0beginning at $150,000 for an individual and $300,000 for a family.\nThat would mean the lost revenue would be something less than $1.7 trillion over 10 years, but still well above $1 trillion, said Kyle Pomerleau, director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation, a free market-oriented think tank. That\u2019s because relatively few people at the higher incomes have children and would be eligible for the tax credits, he told us.\nIn other words, the tax credit is expensive, Pomerlau said, because \"it\u2019s large and nearly universal for families.\"\nThe Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, also did an estimate of the original tax credit proposal and came up with a figure similar to that of the Tax Foundation -- an estimated loss of nearly $1.58 trillion in tax revenue over 10 years.\nRoberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center, told us the center hasn't analyzed Rubio's current proposal. But he said a loss of $1 trillion in tax revenue over 10 years is a fair estimate.\n\n"}

It's just that simple,\" Burke, a Madison School Board member, said in an April 8, 2014 news release.\n\"In Wisconsin, a woman only earns 80 cents for every dollar a man earns -- and pay discrimination doesn't just hurt our families, it hurts our economies, too.\"\nLet's take a look.\nSimilar claims\nIn rating a number of pay-gap claims, we and our PolitiFact colleagues have found that wording is crucial. Two of those fact-checks help put Burke's claim into perspective.\nFormer Dane County executive Kathleen Falk, while campaigning for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination to challenge Walker in the 2012 recall election, said Wisconsin women \"are paid 81 cents to the dollar of a man doing the same job.\"\nThe key phrase was \"same job.\"\nWe rated the statement False, finding that Falk misquoted the very report she relied on. The report said that -- among all men and women in Wisconsin working all sorts of jobs -- women earned 81 cents for every dollar earned by men.\nBurke's claim, in contrast, is more similar to one made by Obama.\n\"You know, today, women make up about half our workforce, but they still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns,\" Obama said in his January 2014 State of the Union speech. \"That is wrong, and in 2014, it's an embarrassment.

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Bernie Sanders Says that in her speech to the pro-Israel group AIPAC, Hillary Clinton \"had one line on the Palestinian people.\"", "evidence": "On ABC\u2019s This Week, host George Stephanopoulos asked Bernie Sanders about his remark during the New York Democratic debate that the United States should play \"an evenhanded role\" with regard to Israel and its neighbors.\nSanders told Stephanopoulos that he thinks President Barack Obama has \"done much better than his predecessors\" in taking the kind of approach he prefers, but added that \"I think we still have a way to go. And I was not criticizing President Obama. I was criticizing (former Secretary of State Hillary) Clinton. She gave a speech to AIPAC\" -- referring to the most prominent pro-Israel group in the United States. \"It's a long speech. It was one sentence, I believe, that even mentioned the Palestinians.\"\nWhile Sanders went on to say that \"it goes without saying\" that \"we have to protect 100 percent Israel's right to exist, its right to live in peace, its right to live in security,\" he added that \"you cannot ignore the suffering of the Palestinian people.\"\nWhen Stephanopoulos asked whether he thought Clinton has ignored the suffering of the Palestinian people, Sanders reiterated that her AIPAC speech had \"one line on the Palestinian people.\"\nWe wondered whether Sanders\u2019 was right that Clinton \"had one line on the Palestinian people\" in her AIPAC speech. So we looked closely at her address.\nThe most obvious way to look at this is to count the number of references to the Palestinians in Clinton\u2019s speech and see if they amount to more than one line. Sanders is wrong by that simple metric, as we\u2019ll show.\nBut to broaden our look somewhat, we also analyzed more generally how much of Clinton\u2019s speech addressed the Israeli-Palestinian peace process as opposed to how much it addressed Israel\u2019s security needs.\nWhat Clinton said about the Palestinians\nHere is the main section of her AIPAC speech -- which she gave on March 21 -- \u00a0that addressed Palestinians. The sentences that mentioned the Palestinians by name are in bold.\nAnd here is a third choice. Will we keep working toward a negotiated peace or lose forever the goal of two states for two peoples? Despite many setbacks, I remain convinced that peace with security is possible and that it is the only way to guarantee Israel\u2019s long-term survival as a strong Jewish and democratic state.\n\nIt may be difficult to imagine progress in this current climate when many Israelis doubt that a willing and capable partner for peace even exists. But inaction cannot be an option. Israelis deserve a secure homeland for the Jewish people. Palestinians should be able to govern themselves in their own state, in peace and dignity. And only a negotiated two-state agreement can survive those outcomes.\n\nIf we look at the broader regional context, converging interests between Israel and key Arab states could make it possible to promote progress on the Israeli-Palestinian issue. Israelis and Palestinians could contribute toward greater cooperation between Israel and Arabs.\n\nI know how hard all of this is. I remember what it took just to convene Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas for the three sessions of direct face-to-face talks in 2010 that I presided over. But Israelis and Palestinians cannot give up on the hope of peace. That will only make it harder later.\n\nAll of us need to look for opportunities to create the conditions for progress, including by taking positive actions that can rebuild trust \u2014 like the recent constructive meetings between the Israeli and Palestinian finance ministers aiming to help bolster the Palestinian economy, or the daily on-the-ground security cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.\n\nBut at the same time, all of us must condemn actions that set back the cause of peace. Terrorism should never be encouraged or celebrated, and children should not be taught to hate in schools. That poisons the future.\n\nEveryone has to do their part by avoiding damaging actions, including with respect to settlements. Now, America has an important role to play in supporting peace efforts. And as president, I would continue the pursuit of direct negotiations. And let me be clear \u2014 I would vigorously oppose any attempt by outside parties to impose a solution, including by the U.N. Security Council.\nThis section includes the word \"Palestinian\" or a variant seven times, over the course of five sentences. So Sanders is wrong that Clinton \"had one line on the Palestinian people.\" She had -- using the strictest definition possible -- five lines.\nMentions of the peace process vs. mentions of Israeli security\nLooking more broadly at the content of Clinton\u2019s speech doesn\u2019t do much to support Sanders\u2019 claim.\nSanders\u2019 point seemed to be that the Palestinians\u2019 interests were being ignored in Clinton\u2019s speech. So we wondered about how much Clinton addressed the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians and how much she talked about the need to preserve Israel\u2019s security. We thought this would be a reasonable proxy for Sanders\u2019 point, since the peace process includes Palestinians as an integral part of the equation, whereas a focus on Israeli security relegates Palestinians\u2019 safety and security to a lower priority.\n\n"}

Wasn\u2019t Trump right, the questioner asked?\nClinton responded, \"Well, he has a very short-term view of history, because it is not at all clear what the final outcome will be in the places that you named.\" She then zeroed in on the situation in Libya:\n\"The Libyan people have voted twice in free and fair elections for the kind of leadership they want,\" Clinton said in the Nov. 19, 2015, speech. \"They have not been able to figure out how to prevent the disruptions that they are confronted with because of internal divides and because of some of the external pressures that are coming from terrorist groups and others. So I think it's too soon to tell, and I think it's something that we have to be, you know, looking at very closely.\"\nWe wondered whether Clinton was correct to say that \"the Libyan people have voted twice in free and fair elections for the kind of leadership they want,\" so we took a closer look.\nThe big picture\nFinding anything to cheer about in Libyan politics and governance today requires a lot of squinting.\n\"Libya has no leadership at all at the moment,\" said Amanda Kadlec, a project associate in defense and political sciences at the RAND Corp. who specializes in Libya. \"Even though two governments -- one based in Tripoli and the other in Tobruk -- are competing for power, it is essentially a non-governed state, because the mandate of the most recent elected government expired at the end of October this year. Its members extended the mandate, a decision that foreign governments on the whole have not supported.\"\nIn other words, Libya\u2019s government is pretty close to non-functional right now, so any victories in the democratization process are hard to find.\nThat said, Clinton did acknowledge that point in her answer, so we\u2019ll focus on the more specific assertion she made -- that the Libyan people have participated twice in \"free and fair elections.\"\nFree and fair elections?\nThere have been three major elections held in Libya since the fall of Gaddafi -- parliamentary elections in July 2012, elections for the constitutional drafting assembly in February 2014, and parliamentary elections in June 2014. Each received at least some praise from outside observers for integrity of the balloting process, but each, to one degree or another, also faced problems. (A Clinton campaign spokesman said she was referring to the two parliamentary elections, not the constitutional drafting assembly.)\nHere\u2019s a brief rundown:\n\u2022 Parliamentary election, July 2012. This election, which took place in something of a honeymoon between Gaddafi\u2019s fall and the emergence of armed fighting, offers the strongest support for Clinton\u2019s claim that free and fair elections have been held in Libya.\nThe Carter Center -- an organization founded by former President Jimmy Carter that offers election assistance to newly democratizing countries -- released a post-election report in May 2013 that found Libya\u2019s first national vote to be \"a major step forward in the country\u2019s transition from authoritarian rule to participatory democracy.\"\n\"Despite overwhelming challenges,\" the center wrote, \"Libyan authorities organized the election in a timely, orderly, and impartial manner that offered Libyans a historic opportunity to exercise their franchise.\" The report described most of the country as \"peaceful and jubilant\" on election day, with about 62 percent turnout among registered voters.\nStill, even in this relatively successful election, problems lurked.\n\n"}

Harry Reid, as the charges came only a few weeks after Krolicki began exploring a run against Reid in 2010.\nThe case against Krolicki was thrown out before it went to trial, so he\u2019s technically innocent in the eyes of the law. But the decision to indict didn\u2019t appear out of thin air, as the Republican had previously been the target of a probe into possible financial mismanagement of a state-run program.\nAn audit and an indictment\nThe charges stem from a 2007 audit of a state college savings program overseen by Krolicki during his time as the state treasurer (a partisan, elected position in Nevada) and alleging that he mismanaged the program\u2019s finances.\nThe audit found the $3.3 billion program, which gives parents options for tax-free investments toward future college costs, failed to follow standard state budgeting procedures and that more than $6 million in collected fees wasn\u2019t being deposited into official accounts and were instead directly allocated toward other program costs.\nThis so-called \"off-line budgeting\" was used for a variety of purposes, including nearly $1 million in legal fees and $1.5 million for an advertising campaign for the program featuring Krolicki as the program\u2019s spokesman \u2014 meaning the office substantially overspent the budget approved by state lawmakers.\nThe audit accounted for all of the money collected and spent by the program, and Krolicki was never accused of pocketing the money or otherwise enriching himself (though the indictment said he benefited politically from appearing in advertising).\nKrolicki, for his part, denied any wrongdoing (telling a reporter \"I sleep very well at night\") and characterized the audit as a struggle between the legislative and executive branches of state government, saying he relied on advice from public and private counsel and even clearing the disputed contracts with the attorney general\u2019s office.\n\"In my view, he hadn\u2019t done anything wrong,\" Scott Scherer, Krolicki\u2019s attorney at the time, told PolitiFact. \"This was merely a dispute over process.\"\nFormer Democratic Assemblywoman Chris Giunchigliani, who testified as a witness during the grand jury hearing on Krolicki, told PolitiFact that Krolicki likely violated the state\u2019s budget act by going around state lawmakers and having no legislative oversight on the program\u2019s spending.\n\"I felt it was a maneuver to go around what the legislature budgeted,\" she said. \"Why would you even call a grand jury if it wasn\u2019t something inappropriate?\"\nCortez Masto\u2019s office sought and obtained a grand jury indictment against Krolicki and his chief of staff Kathy Besser on felony charges related to the audit in December 2008.\nKrolicki actually broke the news himself, holding an hour-long press conference days before the indictment came out and decrying Cortez Masto as engaged in a \"partisan witch hunt.\"\nThe Republican pleaded not guilty to all charges, and the case quickly turned into a fight over whether or not the Attorney General\u2019s office had a conflict of interest in prosecuting a fellow state official to whom her office and previously provided legal counsel, including on contracts related to the College Savings program.\nCortez Masto was forced to seek an expensive special prosecutor for the case after a judge disqualified her office due to a \"conflict of interest\" and district attorneys in Reno and Las Vegas declined to take up the case.\nUltimately, a judge dismissed the indictment \"without prejudice\" after finding it to be overly vague and lacking detail.

This is a measure that tends to reflect the typical wages of people with stable employment and it is adjusted for inflation.\nThis figure has been calculated quarterly since 1979.\n\nIt might be reasonable to describe the overall wage pattern from the mid 1990s to the mid 2010s as \"stagnant\" or \"unimpressive,\" but it\u2019s not the case that they \"effectively went down\" over those two decades.\nIn July 1994, median inflation-adjusted wages stood at $314. They peaked at $345 in early 2009, right before the Great Recession fully hit wages. That\u2019s an increase of about 10 percent \u2014 not very strong over 15 years, but not a downward path, either.\n\n"}

As the economy gears up, more people working, better jobs and careers -- those revenues come rolling in, and the deficit, which is one of the other criticisms (of Trump\u2019s economic policy), is coming down, and it\u2019s coming down rapidly. Growth solves a lot of problems.\"\n\n\n\nAs it happens, the deficit hasn\u2019t come down to date -- which sparked a quick backlash on social media and prompted Kudlow to amend his remarks later that day. Kudlow told the Washington Post that \"the economy is so strong right now it\u2019s going to produce lower deficits. I probably should have said future deficits.\"\nHowever, that assertion is questionable as well. The most trusted source for future budget projections, the Congressional Budget Office, shows rising deficits for years into the future.\nThe deficit so far under Trump\nIn fiscal year 2015, when Barack Obama was president, the federal deficit was $438 billion. (A refresher: The deficit refers to federal revenues minus federal outlays. Each year\u2019s deficit adds to the overall public debt.)\nIn fiscal year 2016, which was also under Obama, the deficit rose to $585 billion.\nIn fiscal year 2017, which was about two-thirds on Trump\u2019s watch, the deficit rose to $665 billion.\nThe deficit also rose as a percentage of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product -- a way of comparing economic statistics across time. In fiscal year 2015, the deficit was 2.4 percent of GDP, rising to 3.2 percent of GDP in fiscal 2016 and 3.5 percent in fiscal 2017.\nSo on a full-year basis, Kudlow is wrong.\n\n"}

On the other, some experts have said that the demise of coal as an energy source has less to do with emissions than with lost market share to a competing fossil fuel -- natural gas -- and technological improvements that have bolstered renewable energies such as wind and solar.\nHere\u2019s how Pruitt answered Todd\u2019s suggestion that the administration was making a \"false promise.\"\n\"Dead wrong, because the numbers show exactly the opposite,\" Pruitt said. \"In fact, since the the fourth quarter of last year until most recently, we've added almost 50,000 jobs in the coal sector. In the month of May alone, almost 7,000 jobs.\"\nIs that correct? Calculating job figures for the coal industry is tricky, as we have previously noted, but we found reason to be skeptical of Pruitt\u2019s numbers.\nThe EPA pointed us to a separate interview Pruitt had on ABC\u2019s This Week, when he said, \"We've had over 50,000 jobs since last quarter -- coal jobs, mining jobs -- created in this country. We had almost 7,000 mining and coal jobs created in the month of May alone.\"\nThis is also not firmly backed by data.\nThe BLS numbers\nLet\u2019s start with the official Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers.\nCurrently, the BLS counts about 50,000 coal mining jobs in the United States -- total. That makes it all but impossible for the first half of Pruitt\u2019s claim -- 50,000 more mining jobs since the end of last year -- to be accurate.\nIndeed, according to the BLS data, the actual increase in coal jobs since the end of last year was 1,300, while the monthly increase in May was 400. That\u2019s far below the increases of 50,000 and 7,000 that Pruitt cited, respectively.\nBased on his comments to ABC, Pruitt appears to have been referring to the broader \"mining and logging\" sector in the BLS data. But even by that standard, his numbers are inflated.\nThe mining and logging sector has grown by 38,000 jobs since the end of last year and grew by 6,000 in May. He\u2019s close when he calls 6,000 \"almost 7,000,\" but 38,000 is well short of 50,000.\nAnd if Pruitt meant to refer to these statistics, they include logging jobs as well -- a sector he didn\u2019t reference on the shows.\nAre there other job numbers to analyze?\nThe coal industry has long chafed at the BLS\u2019 definition of coal-sector jobs. Terry Headley, the director of communications for the American Coal Council, said that coal employment numbers compiled independently by states are typically much larger than what BLS has found, perhaps because many states use broader definitions of who should be counted.\n\n"}

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Bill White \"Rick Perry attempted to fast-track unnecessary coal-fired power plants, which degrade air quality and would cost billions. Fortunately, a court stopped him.\"", "evidence": "Bill White, the Democratic nominee for governor, recently blasted his opponent's environmental record, saying in a May 17 press release: \"Rick Perry attempted to fast-track unnecessary coal-fired power plants, which degrade air quality and would cost billions. Fortunately, a court stopped him.\"\n\nWe wondered if White's salvo is on target.\n\nSome history: Perry issued his so-called fast-tracking order Oct. 27, 2005, \"to encourage diversity of energy supply.\" The order told the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, which is responsible for judging requests for permits to pollute the air, to \"prioritize and expedite the processing of environmental permit applications that are protective of the public health and environment and propose to use Texas' natural resources to generate electrical power.\"\n\nThe order, issued as natural gas prices climbed and after Hurricane Katrina disrupted natural gas production, shortened administrative hearings on permits, which normally took about a year, to six months. At the time, Perry said he was hoping to spare electricity consumers from rate shocks due to the surging price of natural gas.\n\nA few months later, TXU Corp., a Dallas-based energy company, announced plans to double its power production by building eight coal-fired units. Company executives were joined by Perry at their April 2006 press conference, according to the Dallas Morning News. The company, which had submitted a permit application for two new coal-units in July 2005 and had plans to build another unit permitted by the state in 2003, said it would cost $10 billion to complete all 11 units. TXU also promised to cut emissions of pollutants including sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide and mercury by 20 percent, saying it would spend $500 million on equipment to control pollution at three of its existing coal-fired units in Texas.\n\nIn a Sept. 8, 2006, press release, Perry defended his order and TXU's proposal, saying \"the TXU plants are important to diversifying our energy supply so Texans do not face rate shock every time natural gas prices spike up.\"\n\nTXU was then the state's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, one of several greenhouse gases widely thought to be fueling global warming. The utility acknowledged the proposed plants would emit 78 million tons of carbon dioxide per year, in addition to the 55 million tons per year company plants were already emitting, according to the Morning News.\n\nWhere was White as Perry aligned with TXU? As Houston's mayor, White opposed the eight proposed units as a member of the Texas Cities for Clean Air Coalition, which was formed by then-Dallas Mayor Laura Miller in August 2006 to challenge coal-fired power plant pollution. In September 2006, the Houston Chronicle quoted White saying: \"We need to make sure that power plants built for today have minimal emissions and contributions to global warming, the greenhouse gases, where we will see increasing regulation in this country, and in other countries, in the future.\"\n\nTXU and anti-coal groups faced off for and against the proposed plants, while four groups consisting of people living near proposed plant sites sued Perry, calling his executive order unconstitutional. And in February 2007, a state district judge blocked it, saying Perry overstepped his constitutional authority in \"directing a hearing officer to hold a hearing and reach a decision by a particular deadline.\" The judge issued an injunction that restored power to administrative law judges to delay a hearing on TXU's permit application. The judges then postponed the hearing until June of that year.\n\nNext came a big twist. In the following months, TXU was bought out by private owners, who quickly withdrew requests for permits to build eight of the 11 coal-fired units. In June 2007, the commission granted a permit for the two surviving units, going against an administrative judge's recommendation that the agency reconsider its approval after TXU failed to prove that technology to be used at the plant would effectively control emissions.\n\nOf late, Texas utilities \u2014 not including Luminant (formerly TXU) \u2014 are seeking permits for five more proposed coal-fired and petroleum coke-fired plants.\n\nSo, Perry issued his speed-up order, which was canceled by a judge, as White says. Also as he says, the 11 coal-fired power units that TXU wanted to construct were expected to cost billions.\n\n"}

As we heard doubts about an application process, we started digging up more information about how the committee came together.\n\nWas Carroll accurate that no one recruited people to the task force?\n\nIn March, Scott said the task force would be led by Carroll and the Rev. R.B. Holmes of Tallahassee and comprised of appointees from Attorney General Pam Bondi, House Speaker Dean Cannon, Senate President Mike Haridopolos, Senate President-designate Don Gaetz and House Speaker-designate Will Weatherford.\n\nSen. Gary Siplin, D-Orlando, who was chosen to sit on the 19-member task force, said he knew nothing about an application. He simply told Haridopolos he was interested. The same goes for Smith. (Read Smith\u2019s letter to Haridopolos.)\n\n\"When the governor announced his task force, he stated who he\u2019d get recommendations from,\" said Smith, who started his own task force to look into the law. \"I called those people and expressed my desire to serve. And I\u2019ve expressed publicly in many news outlets my desire to serve. So I was surprised that there was an application process that I did not know about.\"\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about the process. In short, some members were chosen because they asked to be, like Carroll said. But we found several cases where task force members said explicitly that they were recruited, some by Carroll\u2019s own chief of staff.\n\nHaridopolos, the Senate president, recommended Scott choose one senator from a list of seven senators that included four Democrats -- Larcenia Bullard of Miami, Arthenia Joyner of Tampa, Siplin and Smith -- and three Republicans -- David Simmons of Altamonte Springs, Andy Gardiner of Orlando and Greg Evers of Crestview, according to a March 28 letter.\n\nSiplin and Simmons made the cut.\n\nCannon also made a recommendation. Unlike Haridopolos, he went outside of his chamber. Public records show the House speaker recommended Orlando attorney Derek Bruce, who filled out a standard questionnaire for gubernatorial appointees.\n\n\"The speaker reached out to Mr. Bruce and recommended him to the governor because he thought he would be a good fit for the task force,\" said House spokesman Ryan Duffy.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence in House records that Bruce lobbied Cannon to be on the task force.\n\nSpeaker-designate Weatherford also had some picks: Rep. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, who sponsored the 2005 \"stand your ground\" law, and Rep. Jason Brodeur, a Republican from Sanford, where Martin was shot.\n\nWhen Baxley heard Scott\u2019s instructions, he told us that he called Weatherford and asked him to submit his name for the task force.\n\nBrodeur didn\u2019t ask to be on the task force. But he readily agreed to it when Weatherford called, he said.\n\nBondi nominated two law enforcement leaders, Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings and Florida State Police Chief David Perry, to the task force a week later. She approached them, spokeswoman Jennifer Meale said. No application.\n\nMiami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle told us she received an out-of-the-blue call about joining the committee from Carroll\u2019s chief of staff, John Konkus.\n\n\"He said that they would like me to be on it,\" she said. \"I asked some questions about who else was on there, what was the time frame.\"\n\nShe accepted his offer the next morning. \"I consider it a real duty,\" she said.\n\nSo does Gretchen Lorenzo, a crime prevention coordinator for the Fort Myers police department. She said Konkus called the department, requesting that she be placed on the task force.\n\n\"I was appointed,\" she said. \"It was a great opportunity for our city.\"\n\nTask force member Maria Newman, 64, who stopped volunteering with her neighborhood crime watch unit two years ago, tells a similar story. She said a friend on the Melbourne Police Department asked her if she wanted to be on the task force.\n\n\"I look at it as I\u2019m taking a journey,\" Newman said. \"Hopefully my little voice will go a long ways.\"\n\nMiami community organizer Edna Canino deflected when asked about whether she was recruited onto the task force or volunteered herself, saying \"I don\u2019t think that\u2019s important at this time.\"\n\nSo we know several members of the task force were essentially recruited by Carroll, Cannon or Bondi. It puts a hole in Carroll\u2019s claim that the selections were entirely based on people who \"came to us with an interest in the review.\"\n\nWe did find one person to support that claim: Tampa criminal defense attorney Joe Caimano, who emailed Cannon about serving. In an email, he wrote that his experience litigating \"stand your ground\" cases would be valuable. He ended up on the task force, though we\u2019re not sure who made the decision since Cannon only recommended Derek Bruce.\n\nWe made a public records request for all correspondence -- including any \"applications\" -- between those interested in the task force and the governor\u2019s office on April 19, shortly after the news conference ended. It remained unfulfilled as of May 2, although the governor's office said it would get back to us shortly.\n\nA spokeswoman for Scott clarified Carroll\u2019s comments on April 25, a week after the request, saying, \"There was no formal application process.\"\n\nSpokeswoman Jackie Schutz added: \"Sen.

We sent an e-mail to the organization but our inquiry was not returned.\n\u00a0\nPlantsNeedCO2.org has one mission: \"to educate the public on the positive effects of additional atmospheric CO 2 and help prevent the inadvertent negative impact to human, plant and animal life if we reduce CO 2 .\"\n\u00a0\nThe Web site is chock-full of links to papers, videos and other evidence that more carbon dioxide is actually good for the environment.\n\u00a0\n\"Far from being a pollutant, rising atmospheric CO 2 concentrations will never directly harm human health, but will indirectly benefit humans in a number of ways,\" according to the site. \"In addition to increasing the quantity of food available for human consumption, the rising atmospheric CO 2 concentration is also increasing the quality of the foods we eat.\"\n\u00a0\nWe're going to take the group's claims \u2014 that there is no scientific evidence that CO 2 is a pollutant and that higher CO 2 concentrations actually help ecosystems support more plant and animal life \u2014 one at a time.\n\u00a0\nFirst, PlantsNeedCO2.org claims that there is no scientific evidence that carbon dioxide is a pollutant.\n\u00a0\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency disagrees.\n\u00a0\nOn April 17, 2009, the agency said that thorough scientific review proved that carbon dioxide, along with several other greenhouse gases, are pollutants that threaten human health; it is taking steps to regulate the gases under the Clean Air Act, a law typically reserved for monitoring traditional pollutants including ozone and sulfur dioxide.\n\u00a0\n\"This finding confirms that greenhouse gas pollution is a serious problem now and for future generations,\" said EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson in a press release. \"In both magnitude and probability, climate change is an enormous problem. The greenhouse gases that are responsible for it endanger public health and welfare within the meaning of the Clean Air Act.'\"\n\u00a0\nThe EPA's findings were \"based on rigorous, peer-reviewed scientific analysis of six gases \u2014 carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride \u2014 that have been the subject of intensive analysis by scientists around the world. The science clearly shows that concentrations of these gases are at unprecedented levels as a result of human emissions, and these high levels are very likely the cause of the increase in average temperatures and other changes in our climate,\" according to the press release.\n\u00a0\nPlantsNeedCO2.org's second claim \u2014 that higher carbon dioxide concentrations boost plant and animal life \u2014 is not so clear-cut. To be sure, carbon dioxide is essential to life as we know it, and climate change skeptics have used the argument to reject efforts to reduce greenhouse gases.\n\u00a0\n\"Plant physiologists have known for a long time that most vegetation loves more carbon dioxide,\" wrote Roy Spencer, a scientist at the University of Alabama at Huntsville in a 2008  National Review  article. \"It grows faster, is more drought-tolerant, and is more efficient in its water use. While the pre-industrial CO 2 concentration of the atmosphere was only about 280 parts per million (ppm) by volume, and now it is around 380 ppm, some greenhouses pump it all the way up to around 1,000 ppm. How can environmentalists claim that helping vegetation to grow is a bad thing?\"\n\u00a0\nSo, there's an argument to be made that carbon dioxide concentrations increase plant growth and abundance.\n\u00a0\nBut the claim leaves out some important facts, said Rob Jackson, a professor of global environmental change and biology at Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment.\n\u00a0\n\"Is carbon dioxide good for plants? The narrow answer is yes,\" said Jackson. \"But I think it's misleading to say that, if CO 2 is good for plants, it's good for the environment. ... It's kind of like saying that steroids are good for people \u2014 they build bone and muscle \u2014 but they also have other effects.\"\n\u00a0\nFor example, Jackson's research shows that with higher carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere we would see more wood growth, but that there may also be more pests due to higher temperatures, and longer droughts due to more evaporation.\n\u00a0\nBeyond the  reams  of  scientific research  to demonstrate how dramatically the Earth could change with increased carbon dioxide levels, some studies indicate that more is not necessarily better for plants. For instance, a two-decade study of the Panama and Malaysia rainforests demonstrated that temperature increases of more than 1 degree could lead to 50 percent reduction in tree growth.\n\u00a0\nA study launched in 1997 in California studied the effects of climate change on grasslands. Scientists doubled atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, raised the temperature by 2 degrees, increased precipitation by 50 percent, and raised levels of nitrogen, which is also a product of fossil fuel consumption, to simulate how the Earth might look decades from now. When carbon dioxide levels alone were raised, plants grew quite a bit.\n\u00a0\n\"But when we factored in realistic treatments \u2014 warming, changes in nitrogen deposition, changes in precipitation \u2014 growth was actually suppressed,\" Christopher B. Field, a professor at Stanford, told ScienceDaily in 2002.\n\u00a0\nBut back to PlantsNeedCO2.org's claim. They are wrong that carbon dioxide is not considered a pollutant. According to the EPA, it is. And the claim that \"higher CO 2 concentrations actually help ecosystems support more plant and animal life\" leaves out some important details. While carbon dioxide is good for plants, increased amounts of it in our atmosphere will have auxiliary effects that are decidedly bad for ecosystems. For PlantsNeedCO2"}

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Jack Conway Rand Paul \"wants us to pay $2,000 just to get Medicare.\"", "evidence": "During this election season, Republicans have been hammering Democrats over cuts they say were made to Medicare as part of the health care bill. Now, in a television ad in the Kentucky Senate race, Democrat Jack Conway is turning the tables, attacking Republican Rand Paul over Medicare deductibles.\n\nHere's the transcript of the ad, released Sept. 28, 2010:\n\nNarrator: \"More from Rand Paul.\"\n\nFootage of Rand Paul: \"The real answer to Medicare would be a $2,000 deductible.\"\n\nMan: \"A $2,000 deductible?\"\n\nMan: \"Rand Paul wants us to pay $2,000 just to get Medicare?\"\n\nWoman: \"That's crazy.\"\n\nWoman: \"I can't afford that.\"\n\nFootage of Rand Paul: \"The real answer to Medicare would be a $2,000 deductible.\"\n\nMan: \"I don't know what planet he's from.\"\n\nWoman: \"Rand Paul is off the wall with the $2,000 deductible.\"\n\nMan: \"He knows we can't afford that.\"\n\nWoman: \"The more we hear about Rand Paul, the worse it gets.\"\n\nConway: \"I'm Jack Conway, and I approved this message.\"\n\nThe grainy footage of Paul is real. It comes from a talk that Paul, an ophthalmologist and longtime libertarian, gave to the Center-Right Coalition, a conservative group, in Lexington, Ky., on June 19, 2009. A longer excerpt from Paul's talk has been posted on YouTube.\n\nTo see whether Conway's ad takes Paul's remarks out of context, we transcribed the portion of his speech in which he talks about Medicare.\n\n\"What's the problem in medicine?\" Paul began. \"No price fluctuation. If you're over 65 and go to a doctor in this country, you pay the exact same price with every doctor in the whole country. So when they want to blame ... that on capitalism, we have to be smart enough and say, 'We don't have capitalism. We already have socialism.'\"\n\nHe continued, \"Medicare is socialized medicine. People are afraid of that because, 'Oh, you'll say you're against Medicare.' No, I say we have to do something different. We can't just eliminate Medicare. But we have to figure out how to get more to a market-based system. It's counter-intuitive to a lot of people, but you have to pay for things if you want prices to come down. So you really need higher deductibles. And the real answer to Medicare would be a $2,000 deductible, but try selling that one in an election. But that's the real answer is, you have to pay for things. And when you do, but you also get rid of price controls. So you raise the deductible, you get rid of price controls, and you allow more competition. And you may have to allow more competition from other parties. Nurse practitioners, we already have some. Pharmacists. There have to be ways to allow medicine to come down.\"\n\nHis comment was no one-time slip of the tongue. The Conway campaign released another ad with footage of at least five other occasions in which Paul spoke publicly about his preference for high deductibles for Medicare, sometimes even invoking the same $2,000 figure.\n\nIndeed, Paul has been caught on camera being open about the political hazards of making such a proposal. In the Lexington talk featured in the first ad, Paul immediately followed his mention of the $2,000 figure with the addendum, \"but try selling that one in an election.\" And in the follow-up ad, a clip shows him acknowledging the political risk with striking frankness. \"The hard part,\" he said, \"is how do you present this on national TV? I mean, what's going to happen to me in a statewide race if I tell people I think the Medicare deductible is going to be higher? Am I going to be booted out of the room? I don't know. I'm willing to take a risk because I think it's the right thing to do, and because the other answer is to become just like Canada.\"\n\nWe did not receive a response from the Paul campaign for this article, but the campaign has responded through TV ads. On Oct. 7, the liberal website Talking Points Memo published a side-by-side comparison of the Paul campaign's two response ads and found subtle but noteworthy differences. In the first, the Paul campaign says that Paul \"never supported higher Medicare deductibles.\" In the second, the ad was changed to say that Paul \"doesn't support higher Medicare deductibles.\" Had they stuck with the first ad, it would have been undermined by a half-dozen film clips.\n\nPaul refined his policy toward Medicare during an appearance on Fox News on Oct. 6. Paul said that he did not want to impose deductibles on current Medicare beneficiaries but rather on future beneficiaries, possibly starting with those who are currently 55 or younger.\n\nSo even Paul now acknowledges that he thinks Medicare deductibles are worth considering. But does Conway's ad fairly portray the views Paul had espoused at the time? They come close, but we do offer one caveat.\n\nWe think that the general impression Conway's ad gives -- and in particular the line where the man says, \"Rand Paul wants us to pay $2,000 just to get Medicare?\" -- is that what Paul wants to do is slap seniors with a $2,000 deductible, even though his plan is much more comprehensive. Paul's ideas for Medicare may be good or bad, but the ad is somewhat misleading when it reduces them to a simple $2,000 deductible. That said, we see it as a relatively minor exaggeration"}

And they haven't. They have a different idea that they think will get at the problem.\n\n\nMore than 10 pages of the GOP bill spell out a plan to help people with pre-existing conditions by allowing universal access to expanded and improved state-run high-risk pools. They accept patients who have health conditions that might prompt private insurance companies to reject them. Already, 34 states have high-risk insurance pools.\n\n\n\"We want to encourage all states to have these,\" said House Republican Leader John Boehner. \"And we put more money into these high-risk pools so that we can bring down the cost of health insurance.

{"label": "true", "claim": "Charlie Crist Marco Rubio's \"income skyrocketed while his power increased.\"", "evidence": "In his first TV ad in the U.S. Senate primary, Gov. Charlie Crist wastes no time trying to shatter former House Speaker Marco Rubio's image as an ideologically pure, conservative crusader.Using a line graph with red ink, Crist claims that Rubio's income soared when he became a member of the state House in 2001.\"His income skyrocketed while his power increased,\" the narrator says in the 30-second spot titled \"We Thought He Was Different.\" The line graph starts in 2002 and ends in 2005, and indicates that Rubio's income more than tripled, starting at about $100,000 and rising to more than $300,000.We know state legislators are paid modestly, so we were curious if Crist's made-for-TV graphic is charting reality.To find out, we turned to the Florida Commission on Ethics, which requires elected officials to file a financial disclosure form each year. The forms list a person's net worth, assets and liabilities, and income.Connie Evans, an executive secretary with the commission, provided PolitiFact Florida with Rubio's financial disclosure forms from 1998, when he was a member of the West Miami City Commission, until he left the Florida House as speaker in 2008.The financial disclosure forms include legible income information for every year except 2000. (We could not discern Rubio's handwriting for that year).A lawyer by trade, Rubio reported his income for each year:\n\n1998: $73,380\n1999: $99,000\n2001: $89,878\n2002: $124,721\n2003: $122,718\n2004: $298,825\n2005: $329,916\n2006: $346,896\n2007: $346,000\n2008: $414,000\n\nFor some context: Rubio was part of the House Republican leadership beginning in 2001 as a whip, rose to be majority leader, and was speaker from 2006 to 2008.Rubio's income in the first few years included his salary of between $72,000 and $120,000 plus his West Miami City Commission pay ($1,380) and later his legislative salary (around $30,000 a year). But in 2004, Rubio's income increased dramatically, records show. That year he collected almost $270,000 by working for three separate law firms in South Florida -- Broad & Cassel, Becker & Poliakoff and the Haggard Law Firm.Starting in 2005, Rubio earned $300,000 a year working for Broad & Cassel, a well-connected statewide firm that had done millions of dollars of legal work for the Florida House.Between 2002 and 2005, Broad & Cassel had billed state taxpayers $4.5 million for legal work authorized by former Speaker Johnnie Byrd. Byrd and a managing partner of the firm, Steve Burton, were friends. But the expenses appeared so great that the then-incoming speaker, Alan Bense, ordered an audit of Broad & Cassel's work. The results of the audit were never publicized.In 2008, Rubio added $69,000 from Florida International University where he was hired as a visiting professor.In the television ad, Crist focuses on the years 2002 to 2005, which is a bit misleading because it brackets Rubio's big salary spike in 2004. If you included more years, the income increase is still dramatic, just not as much.Let's compare Crist's graphic (it's the one near the top of this item under the ruling) with two graphics we created ourselves. First, we charted the same thing Crist did, years 2002-2005. Here's what it actually looks like:\n\n\n"}

Collectively, they had $4.5 billion in net earnings in the first three months of 2017.\nThat cash was\"the biggest first-quarter haul for the group since the Affordable Care Act exchanges went live in 2014,\" the article said.\nBut the article doesn\u2019t actually tie those profits to Obamacare.\nThe fact is, Obamacare does not just include\u00a0the exchanges where people buy private insurance. The\u00a0exchanges themselves are a small slice of the overall insurance business.\nDespite the enormous attention paid to the exchanges, they make up less than 4 percent of the insurance market for people under 65. And contrary to Trump\u2019s assertion, they have dragged profits down, not boosted them up, experts say.\nReturns from the exchanges have been so bad, three out of five of the companies listed in the article have fled.\nAetna reported that it lost $650 million in 2016 and 2017 from the policies it sold in the individual market. For 2018, Aetna pulled out of every state exchange.\nUnitedHealth Group has also left the exchanges. It put its combined losses at over $1 billion in 2015 and 2016. Humana, which had sold in 11 states, got out too.\nCigna trimmed its participation from seven states to six. Cigna CEO David Cordani told CNBC in August that the market is \"challenging,\" and that \"we are losing money, but we are losing a little less than we expected.\"\nFor 2018, Anthem also remains, but withdrew from Ohio, Indiana and Wisconsin, and trimmed back the number of counties it serves in Kentucky, Georgia\u00a0and California. It was going to leave Virginia completely, but then struck a deal with the state to sell in counties that would otherwise have no carrier.\nMoody\u2019s Investor Service ranked it as a positive development for companies that exited the exchanges, saying it \"lowered exposure to this challenging business.\"\nThe overall individual market, which includes plans sold on and off the exchanges, brought an estimated $4.7 billion in underwriting losses in 2016, according to the consulting group Oliver Wyman.\nThe news has not been all bad for the companies. Premium hikes in 2016 and 2017 began to balance things out. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a neutral source of health sector statistics, found that insurers who stayed in the exchanges had figured out how to come out ahead, but it took a couple of years for them to get there.\n\n"}

He sponsored a state Senate bill allowing chain gangs during the 1995 legislative session.\nDespite criticism that making humans work in chains was inhumane and echoed the days of slavery, the idea gained traction in the state Legislature. In May 1995, he tacked his Senate bill onto an omnibus corrections bill as an amendment, and it passed.\n\"The Department of Corrections shall implement a plan by Dec. 1, 1995, to require that selected inmates perform labor wearing leg irons in chain gang work groups,\" the measure read.\nThe next month, Crist and state Corrections Secretary Harry Singletary, who had reluctantly agreed to the chain gangs provision, visited the state of Alabama, which had earlier revived the practice.\n\n"}

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Jim Waldman \"You are prohibited from walking into the Capitol with a gun, but you can go after the County Commission or the School Board.\"", "evidence": "In the old days, before Oct. 1, 2011, when folks headed to the beach or a park in some Florida cities, local laws forbade them from strapping a gun to their bathing suit or bringing it along in the picnic basket.\n\nBut in the wake of the deadly shooting in Tucson, Florida legislators during the 2011 legislative session took up a slew of pro-gun laws and one --\u00a0House Bill 45\u00a0-- made it loud and clear that it's up to the state, not each individual city or local government, to set firearm laws. And that means holders of concealed weapons permits are free to bring that gun along with the sunblock and sandwiches to a local or state park.\n\nState law doesn't allow permit holders to bring their guns everywhere -- in fact there's a\u00a0long list\u00a0that shows everywhere guns aren't allowed including:\u00a0\n\n\u2022 \"Any meeting of the governing body of a county, public school district, municipality, or special district;\"\n\u2022 \"Any meeting of the Legislature or a committee thereof;\"\n\u2022 \"Any school, college, or professional athletic event not related to firearms;\"\n\u2022 \"Any elementary or secondary school facility or administration building.\"\n\n\u2022 \"Any place where the carrying of firearms is prohibited by federal law.\"\n\nState Rep. Jim Waldman, D-Coconut Creek,\u00a0who voted against House Bill 45, wants his home county of Broward essentially carved out of the law, so he plans to file a bill to ban carrying guns in many local government buildings in Broward County.\u00a0\n\nIn an Oct. 24 posting on the political blog\u00a0browardbeat.com, Waldman said: \"You are prohibited from walking into the Capitol with a gun, but you can go after the County Commission or the School Board. It is the height of hypocrisy.\"\n\nWaldman's words drew more than a dozen comments from readers and these caught our eye:\n\n\"Jimbo is wrong. It\u2019s legal to bring your gun into the Capitol. It\u2019s illegal to bring it into the chamber, hence the 2nd metal detectors before you enter\u2026\"\n\n\"Maybe Jim should file a bill to allow guns into the Capitol, instead. Let\u2019s see how the gun nuts go for that.\"\n\nWe wanted to check Waldman's claim: Is it illegal to walk into the Capitol with a gun but visitors can pay a visit to the County Commission or School Board with a loaded weapon?\n\nWaldman's bill and House Bill 45\n\nFirst, a word about Waldman's proposed bill, which was in the process of being drafted as of Oct. 27. Waldman's bill would make it illegal to carry a handgun or concealed weapon or firearm within certain government buildings in Broward including the Broward County Governmental Center, the school district's administration building and one building in each city designated by city commissions. Violators would face a second-degree misdemeanor.\n\nBroward County has suggested an even broader ban\u00a0to include additional county sites and Broward's state legislative delegation will have to decide how to proceed on both proposals. (A political aside: a bill tightening gun restrictions from Broward's mostly Democratic legislative delegation will face an uphill battle in Republican-dominated Tallahassee. But we're checking Waldman's facts here -- not his odds.)\n\nHouse Bill 45, which generally prohibits local governments from regulating firearms, passed the House 85-33 on April 26, 2011, and the Senate 30-8 on April 28 and was approved by Gov. Rick Scott June 2. The law allows judgments of up to $100,000 against local governments that enforce such laws, and local officials could be fired and fined $5,000.\n\nAs the law was set to take effect Oct. 1, cities began eliminating ordinances that banned guns from parks or other places.\u00a0\n\nGuns at the Capitol\n\u00a0\n\nWaldman said, \"You are prohibited from walking into the Capitol with a gun...\"\n\nIn short, he misfired.\n\nPolitiFact Florida asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which oversees the Capitol Police, to explain what HB 45 means with respect to gun-toting visitors at the Capitol.\n\n\"Effective October 1 (as a result of passage of HB 45), concealed weapons permit holders may bring firearms into the Capitol,\" spokeswoman Heather Smith wrote in an e-mail. \"Upon entry, Capitol Police will check that the individual has a permit to carry a concealed firearm. Capitol Police will also provide a written notice that advises them that they are prohibited from entering rooms where the Legislature is in session or in committee. If requested, we do have the ability to temporarily store those firearms (on a limited basis). Prior to HB 45, only sworn law enforcement officers could bring firearms into the Capitol.\"\u00a0\n\nThere are metal detectors to get into the Capitol and the public galleries of the House and Senate but not committee rooms, Smith said.\u00a0\n\nSo that means a person with a valid concealed weapons permit can bring a gun to meet with Rep. Waldman in his office -- but not to watch him vote or speak in the House chamber or during a committee meeting. So Waldman was wrong when he said you can't walk into the Capitol with a gun.\n\nGuns and the School Board/County Commission\n\u00a0\n\nWhat about the rest of Waldman's claim: \"...but you can go after the County Commission or the School Board.\"\n\nState statute\u00a0790.06\u00a0\u00a0lists where you can't bring a gun including any meeting of a governing body of a county, public school district or city as well as to any school event not related to firearms, or school facility or administration building.\n\nSo clearly the statute says you can't bring a gun to a county commission or school board meeting. But could you bring a gun to a commissioner's office?\n\nKraig Conn, an attorney with the Florida League of Cities which fought House Bill 45, said he has gotten about 50 phone calls or e-mails from cities and counties as they struggle to interpret the law. Some may interpret the law to mean permit holders are only forbidden from carrying their guns into the actual room where the commissioners are meeting while others may interpret it to mean that guns are forbidden in city hall -- period.\n\n\"If I'm a city attorney, I'm thinking I really don't want my elected city officials, or administrators, to be charged with a violation, and I would interpret this to mean you can bring your gun if you have a concealed weapons permit but you absolutely cannot have access to the meeting room,\" Conn said. \"If it's a small city hall and there are not a bunch of other offices in it, I'm going to go out on a limb and say you can't bring the gun in the building at all while there\u2019s a meeting.\"\u00a0\n\nBroward assistant county attorney Tricia Brissett wrote in an e-mail that the statute means visitors can't carry a firearm into a county commission meeting but wouldn't answer if visitors could carry guns into areas of county buildings where commissioners aren't meeting. Broward has taken down signs that announced a gun ban -- a clue that the county isn't interpreting the law to mean a total prohibition on guns at the county's administration building.\n\n\nMiami-Dade County interprets the law to mean permit holders can't bring a gun into the county commission meeting, Miami-Dade assistant county attorney Jess McCarty said. But the gun-holder can bring the gun to meet with the mayor in his office.\n\nAny clarification of the law won't occur until the Legislature takes it up again or there are legal challenges, Conn said.\n\nWaldman's explanation\u00a0\n\nIn an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Waldman said his statement was wrong.\n\n"}

Let me repeat that. Our oil production reached its highest level in seven years. Oil production from federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico reached an all-time high. For the first time in more than a decade, imports accounted for less than half of what we consumed. So any notion that my administration has shut down oil production might make for a good political sound bite, but it doesn\u2019t match up with reality,\"\n\nIn this item, we\u2019ll check the first piece of evidence to support his contention that his administration hasn\u2019t \"shut down\" oil production -- that \"last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWe turned to the Energy Information Administration, the federal government\u2019s official office for energy statistics. Since Obama said \"oil production,\" we will only look at oil removed from U.S. territory, rather than natural gas or other petroleum products.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nHere are the annual totals, in barrels produced, going back to 2003:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2003: 2,073,453,000\n2004: 1,983,302,000\n2005: 1,890,106,000\n2006: 1,862,259,000\n2007: 1,848,450,000\n2008: 1,811,817,000\n2009: 1,956,596,000\n2010: 2,011,856,000\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSo, 2010 is definitely the highest since 2003. But we\u2019ll note a couple of caveats.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFirst, production levels actually have been quite stable over the eight-year period. Comparing 2009 and 2010 statistics, petroleum production only rose about 3 percent. And the level for 2010 is only 11 percent higher than for the lowest year in that eight-year period. So the increase the president is referring to is not particularly dramatic.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe second caveat is that the Energy Information Administration projects that production totals are poised to fall from their current levels over the next two years.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDomestic crude oil production, the agency says, is projected to decline by 110,000 barrels a day in 2011 and by an additional 130,000 barrels per day in 2012. The agency makes that projection based on expected production declines in Alaska due to maturing oil fields. Production in the Gulf of Mexico is also projected to decline. Both are partially offset by projected increases in the Lower 48 states, but on balance, EIA sees the numbers falling.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSo Obama is right that American oil production is at its highest level since 2003, but we\u2019re taking the statement down a notch on our rating scale because the amount is projected to fall during each of the next two years, making it somewhat problematic to use the number as evidence that domestic oil production is on a healthy trendline"}

The studies say: \"Since the 1960\u2019s, at least 44 of these facilities, plus the furniture, fixtures, and equipment held in trust for the students were transferred by Shelby County Schools to the special school district at no direct cost to the Memphis City Schools.\"\n\nOne figure in the study shows that for each year since 1965 exactly $0.00 flowed to Shelby County in exchange for the schools.\n\nThomas\u2019s statement is worth quoting in full, because it captures the prevailing suburban view: \u00a0\"I think it\u2019s funny over the past many years that Shelby County donated \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, gave \u2013 44 schools to the city of Memphis . . . \u00a0when they annexed areas. And now all of a sudden when a municipality, when a city in the county wants to educate those children, we are going to say we are going to charge you but we were giving them to Memphis? Personally I think that stinks. I think it\u2019s unfair.\"\n\nFlinn cites, among others, blog posts from Smart City Memphis, the consultant firm run by Tom Jones, a close aide to county mayors from the late 1970s until the early 2000s. \"It\u2019s how you understand a contract \u00a0\u2014 \u00a0consideration is more than just cash,\" Flinn said.\n\nSmart City\u2019s blog has taken serious issue with those studies, and in particular targeted former suburban Shelby County Schools (SCS) superintendent Jim Mitchell. A post titled \"Town Districts School Building Fiction\" quotes Mitchell at a suburban forum saying, \"That is not what\u2019s been done in this county for 45 years.\" Meaning, the county had not gotten payment from Memphis for schools during annexations.\n\nJones wrote: \"Let\u2019s say it simply: he is wrong.\" He added: \"There have been torturous negotiations to give county government financial consideration . . . using waivers of ADA funding requirements, offsetting financial credits, or through joint design of schools by city and county school district.\"\n\nIn other words, although there was not a direct cost, Memphis-partisans point out that the county was indirectly compensated in other ways, such as agreements to allow the county to forego what is commonly referred to as the Average Daily Attendance (ADA) funding requirement. ADA requirements mean that for every $1 the county gives for capital improvements to the suburban system, it has had to give a corresponding share to Memphis City Schools (MCS) based on the city\u2019s much-larger student population.\n\n\"When I\u2019ve heard the county commissioners, it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, they annexed and they got the schools la dee da,\u2019 \" Flinn said. \"But that\u2019s not an accurate rendition. It was a negotiated transaction, with give and take on both sides.\"\n\nWhere the feasibility studies do reference negotiated agreements between the city and county over the schools, to waive ADA requirements, they do so in the form of footnotes. \u00a0Ernest Kelly, the attorney at Evans, Petree who litigated for MCS for decades, said those footnotes came out of years-long legal wrangling.\n\nThose footnotes show that Memphis ultimately agreed to allow Shelby County a $12 million waiver on ADA funds as \"credit\" for Memphis taking schools in annexations from the late 60s and early 70s.\n\nTo Memphis at the time, $12 million spent on suburban school capital improvements meant, because of the then $5.7-to-$1 ADA split, it stood to see $68.4 million flow into its coffers from county government. That $68.4 million equates to $229 million in purchasing power in the 2010 economy, and the website MeasuringWorth.com calculates that $68.4 million in projects in the 1978 economy equates to $433 million in projects in the 2010 economy.\n\nFor the suburban school system, the $12 million credit \u00a0\u2014 \u00a0equivalent to $76 million in projects today \u00a0\u2014 \u00a0allowed for construction or renovation of some of the very buildings municipalities want to receive for free. A Jan. 27, 1978, article from longtime Commercial Appeal education reporter Jimmie Covington, now working to help Collierville start a municipal system, points out: \"For several years, the county has not had to share school construction funds with the city because of credits received from the city system for county schools which were annexed. However, about $4 million in county school building projects approved for this year have about exhausted the credits.\" In an April 28, 1978, article, Covington wrote that \"the city system has paid the county for annexed schools by waiving\" the ADA share.\n\nKelly does emphasize that MCS felt strongly it could have and should have received buildings without any considerations, based on an 1898 case, Prescott vs. the Town of Lennox. While cautioning that the legal niceties related to an annexation differ from the current circumstances, Kelly explained that Lennox determined facilities are a public trust and therefore \"the buildings ought to follow the kids.\"\n\n\"We were all suited up and ready to go to Chancery Court,\" Kelly said Thursday, but there were other variables, some having nothing to do with schools \u2013 like the city\u2019s desire to push the burden of costs related to the city\u2019s public hospital over to the county. Cut a deal giving the county something for the annexed schools, MCS was told, so we can save money on the hospital issue.\n\n\"So the legal argument didn\u2019t get resolved on one side or the other,\" Kelly said. \"We had a compromise that . . . eliminated the risk of paying money, which would have been painful and in our view unjust. From the county\u2019s point of view, they got something.\"\n\nTwo of the planners most involved in more recent transfers \u2013 longtime and recently-retired SCS chief of operations Richard Holden and former MCS director of planning Louise Mercuro \u00a0\u2014 \u00a0each said there were agreements in which MCS again agreed to allow the county to waive ADA requirements.\n\n\"Most of them had to do with schools that would eventually become part of Memphis City Schools,\" Holden said.\n\nFor some buildings, MCS and SCS cooperated with joint funding, planning and designing.\n\n\"It was never a straight policy that they give the schools, ever,\" Mercuro said. \"The county always got something out of it, one way or the other.\"\n\nHolden, now a key member of the county\u2019s schools merger transition commission, said that after SCS became an elected board, in 1998, there was more of a push from the suburbs to get fair value from MCS for annexed schools.\n\n\"In the latter years Shelby County Schools board members thought there should be some compensation,\" Holden said. Longtime SCS board chairman David Pickler agreed with that assessment.\n\nAccording to a Feb. 12, 2003 article, one of the initial proposals for financing what became Arlington High School involved crediting the county for $37 million for annexed schools. Both Memphis and suburban school boards \"agreed to the proposal in concept\" but it did not come to fruition. Arlington High School was eventually financed with bonds paid for by a tax levy on non-Memphis residents only.\n\nOur ruling\n\nSo did Shelby County in fact \"give\" 44 school buildings to Memphis City Schools? As the consultants note, exactly $0.00 in real dollars has exchanged hands for the buildings MCS took over during annexations.\n\nBut there were serious past negotiations where the county received considerations of real value, even if it never got a check. Some of the suburban municipalities, in fact, benefitted from new schools or renovations made possible by Memphis agreeing to \"credit\" the county for some value of schools it took over"}

Bill Nelson.\nThe lead-in text above the video offers a hint that the reference was to past statements by Scott (emphasis ours): \"Rick Scott vowed to implement racial profiling laws in Florida and wanted to exclude Dreamers from citizenship.\"\nBut this attack amounts to cherry-picking. Scott softened his stance on illegal immigration years ago and does not have those positions anymore.\nDid Scott encourage racial profiling of immigrants?\nThis attack is misleading. The fine print shows it is in reference to a position Scott took during a GOP primary in 2010.\nThe video cites a sentence from a 2010 TIME magazine article about the Florida 2010 governor\u2019s race. It says, \"Scott favors Arizona\u2019s draconian anti-illegal-immigration law.\"\nScott did promise then to bring a law similar to Arizona\u2019s SB 1070 to Florida.\nThe 2010 Arizona law made being an undocumented immigrant a state crime and required legal immigrants to carry papers to confirm their legal status. Critics said it would lead to racial profiling, prompting state officials to add to the law that police \"may not consider race, color or national origin.\"\nScott argued in 2010 that the law wasn\u2019t racial profiling and said, \"I clearly don't believe in racial profiling.\"\nBut Scott never pushed for such a law after he was elected, breaking his promise.\nA spokesman for Priorities USA Action said the result shouldn\u2019t matter to people who saw the Facebook post.\n\"We say that he vowed to implement laws like Arizona,\" Priorities USA Action spokesman Josh Schwerin said. \"Just because he didn\u2019t get it done doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t pledge to do it.\"\nIn 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court found parts of the Arizona law unconstitutional but upheld the central requirement calling on officers to check the status of people they suspect were undocumented immigrants.\n\n"}
{"label": "pants-fire", "claim": "Dick Black Says Jill McCabe \"supports late term abortions. Larger baby parts are more profitable.\"", "evidence": "Undercover videos in which Planned Parenthood officials discuss harvesting fetal tissue appall state Sen. Dick Black, R-Loudoun.\nA staunch opponent of abortion, Black is seeking to link the controversy to his Democratic opponent this fall, Jill McCabe, a pediatric emergency room physician.\nMcCabe \"supports selling late term abortions for bigger body parts,\" Black tweeted on July 28. He renewed the charge on Aug. 4, tweeting that McCabe \"supports late term abortions. Larger baby parts are more profitable.\"\nSo we decided to examine Black\u2019s charge.\nLet\u2019s start with some background. The controversy over fetal parts erupted last month when the Center for Medical Progress, a conservative group that opposes abortion, released a nine-minute video secretly taped during a 2014 lunch with Deborah Nucatola, Planned Parenthood\u2019s senior director of medical services. The center says the tape shows Nucatola talking about performing partial-birth abortions to keep body parts intact in order to \"sell\" them.\nThe video put Planned Parenthood on the defensive and ignited Republican calls to end federal funding for the group and for investigations into its practices.\nPlanned Parenthood provides a wide array of health services to women -- 97 percent of which are not related to abortions. The organization has denounced the secret taping as a misleading campaign by anti-abortion activists. Officials of the group say fetal tissues are integral to medical research and that the organization does not profit from their sale.\nAllegations by Black and others that profits were made raise legal questions. Federal law bars clinics from selling fetal tissue for gain. It\u2019s legal, however, for clinics to donate the tissue for scientific research and receive reimbursement for their \"reasonable\" costs in providing the tissue.\nCecile Richards, CEO of Planned Parenthood, has said the organization\u2019s clinics don\u2019t sell fetal tissue for profit but do provide it for research and are reimbursed for their collection costs. In the video, Nucatola discusses fees of $30 to $100 per specimen provided.\nArthur Caplan, director of the Division of Medical Ethics at New York University\u2019s Langone Medical Center, told PolitiFact National that the fees Nucatola discusses don\u2019t appear geared to making a profit.\nMany of the sales are made to brokers -- middlemen who process the tissue and then sell it to researchers at significant markups. A vial of highly concentrated fetal liver cells, for example, can sell for about $24,000. The brokers say their prices reflect their high costs of buying medical equipment and employing skilled technicians.\nNow, let\u2019s get back to Black\u2019s claim that McCabe supports selling fetal tissue for profit.\nChris Lore, Black\u2019s legislative assistant, told us the senator\u2019s statement isn\u2019t based on any statement from McCabe explicitly supporting the practice. Instead, Lore said, it\u2019s implicit by the support she\u2019s received from Planned Parenthood.The group has endorsed McCabe and has given her a 100 percent rating. Lore also noted McCabe has been endorsed by NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia.\nIn addition to those endorsements, Lore noted that amid the controversy, McCabe was quoted in a newspaper saying she still supports Planned Parenthood.\n\n"}

Gov. Kim Guadagno on the Brian Lehrer Show on May 11, you'd think New Jersey didn\u2019t have any foreign trade offices for at least a decade until the administration of Gov. Chris Christie set up outposts in Shanghai and London, which led to a big surge in exports.\n\nIn the middle of her statewide tour to highlight New Jersey\u2019s commitment to economic growth, Guadagno did a radio interview on the WNYC program. After discussing the state\u2019s effort to attract jobs from the Hunts Point section of the Bronx, the conversation turned to where Guadagno said the \"real game\" is -- overseas.\n\nHere\u2019s how Guadagno summed up New Jersey\u2019s international outreach:\n\n\"It's no longer just a regional market. It's attracting business from overseas. And New Jersey, for the past decade, hasn't had any offices overseas. Compare that to Pennsylvania (that) has 23. Now we just opened in the last six months, two offices. One in Shanghai and one in London. And we actually saw an increase in our exports of 18 percent.\"\n\nFred Snowflack, a spokesman for Guadagno, said the offices in Shanghai and London opened last year through a joint effort between the New Jersey Economic Development Authority and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Two people are stationed in Shanghai and one person is in London, Snowflack said.\n\nAccording to a September 2010 press release announcing the deal, the duties of the foreign trade representatives include helping to advance export sales of New Jersey companies and arranging visits for potential investors. The London office covers the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions.\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey also confirmed that Pennsylvania has 23 foreign trade offices covering 67 countries. So she is right on that point.\n\nBut she's wrong on two other key points: that the state lacked foreign trade offices for the past decade and that the two new ones led to the 18 percent increase in exports.\n\nActually, a total of 10 full- and part-time overseas offices were in operation during the past decade.\n\nNew Jersey had full-time offices in Tokyo from 1988-2006; London, 1994-2004; Ra\u2019anana, Israel, \u00a01995-2007; Mexico City, 1999-2006; Cairo, 2000-2004; and Sao Paulo, Brazil, 2000-2007. The state had part-time offices in South Korea from 1999-2004; Greece, 2000-2004; China, 2001-2004; and Argentina, 2001-2002.\n\nSnowflack told us those offices closed for financial reasons. Asked about the discrepancy between Guadagno\u2019s radio interview and the information on previous offices, Snowflack wrote in an email:\n\n\"As for the other question, the lieutenant governor has said on many other occasions, including her budget testimony of last year, that the offices were closed during the Corzine Administration. \u00a0I submit that the important point here is that the state has reopened overseas offices, not the exact year in which some of the old ones closed.\"\n\nData from the U.S. Department of Commerce back up the 18 percent increase in exports. Those exports included chemicals, computers and electronic products, and transportation equipment.\n\nBut that's a figure for exports throughout the world and an economics professor expressed doubt that the new offices deserve much credit.\n\n\"I wish economics were that easy,\" Rutgers University professor Thomas Prusa said.\n\nSnowflack told us Guadagno was not linking the export increases to the new offices.\n\n\"She was not saying that the two new offices were directly responsible for the increase in exports,\" Snowflack wrote in an email. \"Her point was that New Jersey is trying to rekindle business relationships overseas, as evidenced by an increase in exports and two new offices. But she never said two offices that opened within the last year prompted an 18 percent increase in exports.\"\n\nThat may have been what she meant, but listeners who heard her would clearly be under the impression there was a link. She said, \"Now we just opened in the last six months, two offices. One in Shanghai and one in London. And we actually saw an increase in our exports of 18 percent.\"\n\nHer wording suggests a clear linkage.\n\nLet\u2019s review:\n\nGuadagno said New Jersey has opened foreign trade offices in Shanghai and London, marking the first in at least a decade. She\u2019s right about those two offices, but she\u2019s wrong to say such international efforts haven\u2019t been done before. In fact, New Jersey had 10 offices at various times during the past decade.\n\nAnd there's little, if any, evidence that the offices led to the 18 percent increase"}

His divisive brand of politics may have made national headlines, but those policies have hurt middle-class families right here in Wisconsin.\"\nShe added: \"But the people of Wisconsin, we know Scott Walker. He promised us 250,000 new jobs. But what did we get? We\u2019re 9th out of 10 midwestern states in job growth -- ninth out of 10! And the typical Wisconsin worker makes $5,000 less each year than our neighbors in Minnesota.\"\nLet\u2019s see if Burke\u2019s statement about a Minnesota advantage in the Walker era holds up.\nWhat the numbers show\nBurke\u2019s campaign cited one source for numbers on earnings. We looked at it and two others.\nAll show Minnesota on top.\n-- The annual average wage of Minnesota workers was $47,370 as of May 2013 -- $5,060 higher than the $42,310 figure for Wisconsin, according to survey-based estimates published by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The 2013 data is the most recent available.\n-- Average earnings per job in 2012 were $53,928 in Minnesota, $4,931 more than Wisconsin\u2019s $48,997, according to the most recent U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data. That figure takes in a larger group -- not only workers\u2019 wages and salaries but \"proprietor\u2019s income\" from self-employment.\n-- The same data, stripped down to exclude proprietor\u2019s income to focus more on regular salaries and wages, shows a gap of $5,757 in Minnesota\u2019s favor, according to research by Dale Knapp at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance.\nSo Burke\u2019s figures are solid.\nMore about the numbers\nIn her convention speech, Burke argued in a general way that Walker\u2019s policies are linked to the wage gap.\nGiven all the factors that influence a state\u2019s economy, experts agree the actions of a governor have a limited effect. Nevertheless, Burke\u2019s claim misses the mark by pinning the gap solely on Walker.\nThe Minnesota-Wisconsin wage gap dates to at least the 1960s, and gradually has grown despite ups and downs.\nWhen we asked Burke campaign spokesman Joe Zepecki about that, he argued that Walker's economic policies -- which Walker touts as turning the state around -- haven't improved it or closed that gap. As examples, he cited Walker\u2019s refusal to accept the federal expansion of Medicaid and his opposition to a minimum wage increase.\nBy any of our three measures, the gap did not narrow in Walker\u2019s first two years.\nIt grew significantly based on the average earnings per job data. It held steady if you use the other two methods.\nThe average earnings data shows the Minnesota wage advantage averaged 7.4 percent during the second four-year term of Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, who preceded Walker. So far under Walker the average is 8.8 percent.\nThe gap of 9.1 percent in 2012, Walker\u2019s second year, is the highest since 2000, when Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson was in charge.\nIt\u2019s not that Wisconsin\u2019s average wage has fallen during the Walker era. It\u2019s up 5.5 percent in two years, right around the national average increase.\nBut Minnesota has fared somewhat better, which creates the increase in the gap.\nIn combing through the annual average wage data for the two states, there are some interesting disparities between specific jobs.\nMinnesota ran up part of its lead on these:\n\n\n\n\nOccupation\n\n\nMinnesota average wage\n\n\nWisconsin average wage\n\n\n\n\nRegistered nurse\n\n\n$71,160\n\n\n$64,460\n\n\n\n\nManagement, all positions\n\n\n$107,130\n\n\n$97,920\n\n"}

Bayer\u2019s planned investment in New Jersey will help keep us the premier state in the nation for the pharmaceutical industry in addition to creating needed jobs and giving a boost to our state\u2019s economy.\"\n\nNovo Nordisk spokesman Ken Inchausti told us in an e-mail that the Danish pharmaceutical company last October announced plans for another expansion, on Scudders Mill Road in Plainsboro.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the Democrats cited Novo Nordisk\u2019s move to Princeton in their Jan. 18 release, but that\u2019s in Mercer County. Christie\u2019s address cited the company\u2019s location in Middlesex County, which is the Plainsboro expansion announced three months ago.\n\nDemocrats spokesman Chris Donnelly declined to comment further on the release, which doesn\u2019t clarify whether Christie was talking about the businesses\u2019 initial arrival in New Jersey or expansion plans.

We found that the three companies arrived in New Jersey before Christie became governor and anyone heard of a \"Jersey Comeback,\" but Bayer and Novo Nordisk announced expansion plans after Christie\u2019s election"}
{"label": "false", "claim": "Mark Batinick Says California has \"30% or a third of the country\u2019s people living at or below the poverty level.\"", "evidence": "In the thick of tax policy debates, Illinois politicians often point to other states to make their case.\nAnd this year has been no exception in Illinois\u2019 most pitched policy battle \u2014 the debate over whether to replace Illinois\u2019 current flat-rate income tax with a graduated system in which taxpayers with more income would pay higher rates. We\u2019ve already fact-checked several claims from Illinois politicians \u2014 including Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who is spearheading the push \u2014 about how states with graduated tax systems are functioning.\nLast week, we heard a new one. It was a striking criticism of California, a graduated-tax state, from a suburban Republican lawmaker opposed to Pritzker\u2019s plan.\nDuring a conversation about the graduated income tax on a WCPT-AM talk show, a caller mentioned California in a positive light. In response, GOP state Rep. Mark Batinick of Plainfield, cautioned against using the state as a model for policy in Illinois.\n\"The people being hurt in California \u2014 I think it has 30% or a third of the country\u2019s people living at or below the poverty level,\" Batinick said.\nWhile California\u2019s poverty rate ranks among the nation\u2019s highest, federal data show the state is far from being home to a third of the nation\u2019s poor.\nCensus results\nThe federal government measures poverty several different ways. For comparing poverty figures nationally, the U.S. Census Bureau recommends using data from the Current Population Survey, its official source for national poverty estimates.\nThe survey contradicts Batinick\u2019s claim. California\u2019s share of those in the U.S. living below the poverty line is just over 12%, according to the latest data. That mirrors its share of the nation\u2019s population overall.\nThe Census also releases a supplemental poverty measure, which accounts for cost-of-living \u2014 including taxes, housing, medical costs and non-cash benefits people can put toward their basic needs. Its most recent release gives California a larger share of those living in poverty nationwide, but still falls well below what Batinick said. Here, the math works out to just below 17%.\nResearchers say the supplemental measure does a better job at capturing poverty, but it\u2019s still not perfect \u2014 including for California, where housing costs are high.\nZach Parolin, a research scientist at the Center on Poverty & Social Policy at Columbia University, suggested looking at \"food insecurity\" \u2014 a separate federal ranking measured by the U.S. Department of Agriculture \u2014 to add to the picture of economic hardship in California. When comparing by state how accessible food is for members of households to live active and healthy lives, California performs better than the national average.\nCalifornia vs. Illinois and Batinick\u2019s response\nCalifornia\u2019s graduated income tax starts with a rate of 1% for those making the least and then increases by marginal rates before topping out at 13.3% for earnings over $1 million, according to the Tax Foundation.\n\n"}

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Mitt Romney \"Speaker Gingrich has said that we ought to get rid of our child labor laws.\"", "evidence": "Newt Gingrich has a bold solution for helping kids in poor communities climb out of poverty: put them to work.\n\nThe Republican presidential candidate and current front-runner in many polls suggested, in a Q & A with students at Harvard University Nov. 18, that poor children should be paid to work as janitors in their schools to learn a work ethic and begin to rise to prosperity.\n\n\"Get any job that teaches you to show up on Monday. Get any job that teaches you to stay all day, even if you\u2019re having a fight with your girlfriend. I mean, the whole process of making work worthwhile is central,\" the former House speaker said.\n\nGingrich has taken considerable heat over his comments, and in an interview with Fox News on Dec. 6, his Republican rival Mitt Romney highlighted the issue as one on which he and Gingrich differ.\n\n\"Speaker Gingrich has said that we ought to get rid of our child labor laws. That, I think, is a mistake,\" Romney told Fox\u2019s Carl Cameron.\n\nDitching the nation\u2019s child labor laws would be a radical move. We wanted to know if that\u2019s what Gingrich is really proposing.\n\nWhat he said\n\nAt Harvard, a female freshman stood and asked Gingrich what he proposes to do about growing income inequality and declining social mobility in America.\n\nGingrich cited three main factors that have caused the inequality -- the collapse of the housing market, which took much of middle-class America\u2019s wealth with it; a decline in manufacturing jobs, which he blames on government policies; and an education system that fails poor kids while cutting off other pathways out of poverty.\n\n\"Core policies of protecting unionization and bureaucratization against children in the poorest neighborhoods crippling them by putting them in schools that fail has done more to create income inequality in the United States than any other single policy\" he said. \"It is tragic what we do in the poorest neighborhoods entrapping children in, first of all, in child laws which are truly stupid. Okay, you say to somebody, \u2018you shouldn\u2019t go to work before you\u2019re what, 14, 16 years of age. Fine. You\u2019re totally poor. You\u2019re in a school that is failing with a teacher that is failing.\u2019\n\n\"I tried for years to have a very simple model. Most of these schools ought to get rid of the unionized janitors, have one master janitor, and pay local students to take care of the school. The kids would actually do work, they would have cash, they\u2019d have pride in the schools, they\u2019d begin the process of rising.\n\n\"You go out and talk to, as I do regularly, talk to people who are really successful in one generation. They all started their first job between 9 and 14 years of age. They all were either selling newspapers, going door to door, they were doing something. They were washing cars. They all learned how to make money at a very early age. What do we say to poor kids in poor neighborhoods? Don\u2019t do it. Remember all the stuff about don\u2019t get a hamburger-flipping job -- the worst possible advice to give to poor children.\n\n\"Get any job that teaches you to show up on Monday. Get any job that teaches you to stay all day, even if you\u2019re having a fight with your girlfriend. I mean, the whole process of making work worthwhile is central.\"\n\nHis remarks generated a lot of buzz, and Gingrich addressed the issue again at a campaign stop in Des Moines, Iowa on Dec. 1.\n\n\"You have a very poor neighborhood. You have kids who are required under law to go to school. They have no money. They have no habit of work. What if you paid them part time in the afternoon to sit in the clerical office and greet people as they came in? What if you paid them to work as the assistant librarian? And I'd pay them as early as is reasonable and practical.\"\n\n\"Then we get down to the janitor thing,\" Gingrich continued, in reference to his previous comments. \"(I received) letters written that said janitorial work is really hard and really dangerous and this and that. OK, fine. So what if they became assistant janitors and their job was to mop the floor and clean the bathroom. And you paid them.\"\n\nOn Dec. 6, in a radio interview with host Curtis Sliwa on WNYM-AM 970, Gingrich further clarified what jobs he thinks young kids should and shouldn\u2019t have. \"They could be the person who greets you when you walk in the door,\" Gingrich said, according to POLITICO. \"They could help in the school library. They can help in the kitchen. They can help clean up after lunch.\"\n\n\"Kids shouldn't work in coal mines, kids shouldn't work in heavy industry,\" he said.\n\nWhat the law says\n\nChild labor laws are contained in the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. According to the Department of Labor, the laws \"were enacted to ensure that when young people work, the work is safe and does not jeopardize their health, well-being or educational opportunities. These provisions also provide limited exemptions.\"\n\nThe law establishes that minors be paid minimum wage, sets hours that 14- and 15-year-olds can work (i.e., not after 7 p.m. except in the summer) and prohibits youths from working in places like mines, factories or boiler and engine rooms. They are permitted to do office work, kitchen cleaning, cashiering, bagging and customer carry-out. (Our favorite exemption: \"the making of wreaths composed principally of natural holly, pine, cedar, or other evergreens.\")\n\nBased on Gingrich's remarks, he doesn't appear to have any desire to do away with the law's provisions banning youngsters from dangerous workplaces. His argument, instead, seems to be with restrictions on younger children working.\n\nGingrich\u2019s side\n\nR.C. Hammond, Gingrich\u2019s campaign spokesman, said the point of Gingrich\u2019s idea is \"to instill a work ethic in every youngster.\"\n\n\"To help you start off on the right foot and be successful in life, it\u2019s helpful to start work early,\" Hammond said. \"The point that Newt was making is that public schools should make opportunities to go to work. It could be anything, and it\u2019s pretty much on par with whatever your first summer job was.\"\n\n(Hammond\u2019s first job: camp counselor. Gingrich's, in Stuttgart, Germany, where his father was serving in the Army, was at a bowling alley that didn\u2019t have an automatic pin replacer. \"They hired Newt to go and replace the pins that had been knocked down,\" Hammond told us.)\n\nSo was Romney correct that Gingrich wants to do away with the existing law?\n\n\"Any characterization that doesn\u2019t encompass what we just discussed is inaccurate,\" Hammond said.\n\nOther perspectives\n\nJeffrey Miron, a Harvard University economics lecturer and senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute, said he thought saying Gingrich wants to get rid of the law \"seems a little broad brushed and overly strong. It would be a weakening of child labor laws.\" But that might not be all bad, he said.\n\n\"For some families it would be nice if another $10 or $20 a week came in, and I think that parents are better at making those decisions than a blanket rule,\" he said. \"Why should it be the government\u2019s business?\"\n\n"}

Steve Stockman, R-Friendswood, said in a recent fundraising letter.\nThe letter, forwarded to PolitiFact by a reader Aug. 19, 2013, sought donations to the National Association for Gun Rights to battle \"the U.N.\u2019s \u2018Small Arms Treaty\u2019 \" and said that the treaty\u2019s provisions include \"mandating a new international gun registry.\"\nStockman also wrote that the treaty \"sets the stage for confiscation on a global scale.\" A \"gun registry\" might facilitate that by telling the United Nations where everybody\u2019s guns are. We wondered whether the treaty really creates a registry.\nWe did not hear back from Stockman or the association about this claim, so we were unable to determine when the letter was sent out or to verify it had not been altered. But the same claim appears on a web page at the association\u2019s site with a shorter version of the letter also attributed to Stockman.\nPolitiFact has looked at similar claims about the United Nations before, most recently finding that a letter supposedly outlining a U.N. plan to \"disarm civilians\" was fake. In December 2012, PolitiFact Texas rated as Pants on Fire a chain email saying the Obama administration planned to use international treaties to ban all U.S. weapons.\nAnd in August 2012, PolitiFact Georgia tackled a claim very similar to Stockman\u2019s. Georgia Republican U.S. Rep. Paul Broun said in a video from the same gun-rights group Stockman was supporting, \"If passed by the U.N. and ratified by the U.S. Senate, the U.N. Small Arms Treaty would almost certainly force the United States to \u2026 create an international gun registry, setting the stage for full-scale gun confiscation.\"\nPolitiFact Georgia rated that claim, including its implication of confiscating guns, as False. Among its findings: A July 27, 2012, draft of an Arms Trade Treaty that failed to gain U.N. members\u2019 approval would have required the U.S. to report information on international arms sales.\nSome background from that story: The U.N. has been working on a treaty to regulate the global arms trade -- not just small arms -- for years. Backers say it would curtail mass killings and terrorism and keep dictators from killing their own people.\nOn April 2, 2013, according to the U.N.\u2019s website, the organization\u2019s General Assembly \"adopted the landmark Arms Trade Treaty, regulating the international trade in conventional arms.\"\nThe U.S. said \"Yes\" in that vote, and White House spokesman Jay Carney said Jun. 3, 2013, that President Barack Obama planned to sign the treaty \"before the end of August,\" saying it was \"in the interest of the United States.\" For the treaty to take force in the U.S., it would need to be ratified by the U.S. Senate, which on March 23, 2013, voted 53-46 to insert its formal opposition to the treaty into Senate spending legislation.\nThe text of the treaty says its purpose is to regulate the international arms trade and prevent illicit sales and transfers. It applies to arms, ammunition and parts moving across a national border, specifically conventional arms in categories such as \"warships,\" \"combat aircraft\" and \"small arms and light weapons.\"\nThe treaty requires nations to deny authorization to exports of such armaments if they will be used for terrorism, to commit genocide, to attack civilians or in other war crimes, and to take \"appropriate measures\" if they detect that a shipment has been diverted.\nNations are required to maintain a \"national control system, including a national control list,\" report exports and imports to the U.N. each year and regulate brokering with measures that \"may include requiring brokers to register,\" but the treaty doesn\u2019t specify how countries must carry out these directions.\nDaniel Prins, chief of the Conventional Arms branch of the U.N.

Bush in 2002.\n\nSo what gives?\n\nThe public has a somewhat schizophrenic attitude toward politicians, said John Weingart, associate director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University.\n\nOn one hand the public thinks \"they are all useless, at best,\" he said. On the other hand the public expects \"great things from them. And then there is a disappointment when they\u2019re not able to change the world in two years or four years.\"\n\nBen Dworkin, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University, said \"governors typically come in on a wave and when the governor is no longer at the top of the ticket some of the people who were elected during the gubernatorial election might not be as strong.\" They \"ride in on somebody\u2019s coattails and then you don\u2019t have the coattails anymore,\" he said.\n\nBut, Dworkin said, the Republicans have \"have been downplaying expectations\" and have positioned themselves \"to be able to spin a positive message regardless of what the results are\" on Tuesday. \n\n\"If the Republicans just stay even,\" it\u2019s a victory, he said. But if the Republicans \"win one or two or potentially five or six seats\" between the Senate and Assembly it\u2019s a \"huge, huge victory, even if they don\u2019t take control of the Legislature.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nChristie said for more than 48 years, every governor of New Jersey has lost legislative seats at the midterm of his or her first term, with the exception of McGreevey in 2003.\n\nBesides McGreevey, you have to go back to the the 1950s to find a governor who has picked up legislative seats from his or her party in the first midterm election"}

{"label": "false", "claim": "Scott Walker Says the secret John Doe criminal investigation of his campaign has been \"resolved\" and two judges have said it is \"over.\"", "evidence": "A secret criminal investigation made national news with the disclosure that prosecutors had alleged Gov. Scott Walker was at the center of an effort to illegally coordinate fundraising among conservative groups to help his campaign and others.\nBut the next day, the Republican governor and potential 2016 presidential candidate said the John Doe probe had been resolved and that two judges had said it was \"over.\"\nHere is part of the June 20, 2014 interview of Walker by Steve Doocy, host of the network TV talk show \"Fox & Friends\":\nDoocy: \"So, over the last couple of years, there\u2019s been some legal action out in Wisconsin. And some of the documents were unsealed yesterday. We\u2019ve got to point out, you were never charged with anything. But at one point, they allege that you had a central role in a criminal fund-raising scheme. OK, tell us what you did.\"\nWalker: \"Well, don\u2019t just take my word for it. Look at the facts. The facts are pretty clear.\n\"You\u2019ve had not one but two judges -- a state judge and a federal judge; a state judge (who is) a well-respected court of appeals judge, and a federal judge more recently -- have both looked at this argument. And in the past, not just recently -- remember this is not new news, it\u2019s just newly released yesterday because documents were opened -- but no charges, case over.\n\"Both judges said they didn\u2019t buy the argument. They didn\u2019t think that anything was done that was illegal, and so they\u2019ve gone forward and not only said, we don\u2019t buy it, they actually shut the case down, both at the state and at the federal level.\n\"So, many in the national media and even some here in Wisconsin are looking at this (case) backwards. This is a case that\u2019s been resolved, that not one but two judges have said is over. And we\u2019re just learning about it because it became open in a document yesterday. But there is no argument there.\"\nIs that it?\nIs Walker right that the Doe case has been \"resolved\" and two judges have said it is \"over\"?\nExperts say no. After all, one of the key court rulings that has stalled the investigation is a \"preliminary injunction.\" And that is on appeal.\nWhat\u2019s the case about?\nUnder Wisconsin law, a John Doe is \"intended as an independent, investigatory tool to ascertain whether a crime has been committed and, if so, by whom.\"\nUnlike standard criminal investigations, law enforcement officials in a John Doe have special powers, including the power to compel the testimony of reluctant witnesses under oath and to issue subpoenas requiring witnesses to turn over documents.\nAnother key difference is that the judge overseeing a Doe can -- and typically does -- order that the proceedings be done in secret, unlike the vast majority of court proceedings.\nWalker has been connected to two John Doe investigations.\nMilwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, a Democrat, conducted a wide-ranging probe of aides and associates to Walker going back to Walker's time as Milwaukee County executive. That investigation, sometimes known as John Doe I, led to six convictions, ranging from misconduct in office for\u00a0campaigning on county time to\u00a0stealing from a veterans fund. Walker was not charged, and that investigation was\u00a0shut down in March 2013.\nBefore closing that probe, however, Chisholm launched\u00a0a separate investigation in the summer of 2012 based on information learned in the first one. To get what has been termed John Doe II off the ground, Chisholm worked with district attorneys from four counties -- members of both parties -- and the state Government Accountability Board, which administers the state's elections and ethics laws. Francis Schmitz, a former assistant U.S. attorney and\u00a0self-described Republican, was named special prosecutor in the case.\nWalker\u2019s evidence\nAlleigh Marre, spokeswoman for Walker\u2019s campaign, cited two court documents to back Walker\u2019s claim. It\u2019s not clear what she was referring to in the first document, a December 2013 court filing by Schmitz, and she didn\u2019t respond to our request to elaborate.\nThe second document was a court order that John Doe Judge Gregory Peterson issued on Jan. 10, 2014. It quashed subpoenas that had been issued to Walker\u2019s campaign and several conservative groups. And it ordered the return of any property seized with those subpoenas or with search warrants served on two officials of the groups.\n\n"}

Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., made this argument on ABC\u2019s This Week with George Stephanopoulos on April 14, 2013.\n\nGuest host Jonathan Karl asked, \"But very quickly, are you going to be able to defeat the background checks?\"\n\nSessions replied, \"I don't think it's going to pass. The president of the United States has allowed, each year he's been here, the prosecutions of gun cases to go down. I was a federal prosecutor. I prosecuted those. He needs to prosecute the laws that we have today. They've declined every year since President Bush left office.\"\n\nWe wondered whether that was accurate, so we looked at the data.\n\nFirst, we\u2019ll note that we are focusing on the prosecutions arising from background checks, rather than the number of prosecutions of other types of gun crimes, because Sessions\u2019 statement was made in response to a question about background checks. We\u2019ll also ignore prosecutions by state officials, since Sessions\u2019 statement referred to the presidential role, which oversees federal, not state, prosecutorial actions. (Under President Barack Obama, background check denial information has been made available to state and local law enforcement through the National Crime Information Center, the Justice Department said in a statement to PolitiFact.)\n\nNow, here\u2019s some background on the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The system, which began operating in 1998, is an automated system that enables a gun seller to instantly check a series of government databases to determine whether a potential purchaser is eligible to buy a gun under federal or state law.\n\nIn recent years, the Justice Department has published annual reports on how many times this system has flagged an ineligible purchaser and whether they were prosecuted. Looking back at these individual reports makes it possible to chart the number of prosecutions over time. Here\u2019s a summary:\n\n2005: 135 prosecutions\n\n2006: 112 prosecutions\n\n2007: 122 prosecutions\n\n2008: 105 prosecutions\n\n2009: 77 prosecutions\n\n2010: 44 prosecutions\n\n"}

Nathan Deal has accused Democratic challenger Jason Carter of lacking the political chops for the job.\nDuring two recent debates, Deal asked Carter why he never assumed even minor leadership roles as a state senator or sponsored a successful bill in his tenure under the Gold Dome.\n\"You\u2019ve been in the (state) Senate since I\u2019ve been governor, and you\u2019ve never passed a bill,\" Deal said in the Oct. 7 debate at the Georgia National Fair. \"Why would anybody decide you have the leadership skills needed to lead this state?\"\nPolitiFact decided to delve deeper into Deal\u2019s claim that Carter never passed a bill.\nCarter, an attorney and a grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, was elected in May 2010 to replace state Sen. David Adelman of Atlanta, who resigned to become the U.S. ambassador to Singapore.\nA few months later, Deal, a longtime congressman, was elected to succeed Sonny Perdue, Georgia\u2019s first Republican governor since Reconstruction.\nNow, Carter, 39, is hoping to unseat Deal, 72, in the Nov. 4 general election. A loss for Deal would be a major upset for Republicans who have been solidly in control at the Capitol for about a decade.\nBut what about the governor\u2019s claim?\nA search of the Georgia General Assembly\u2019s records shows Deal is correct.\nIn four years in the state Senate, Carter was primary sponsor of 11 bills, more than half dealing with the popular HOPE scholarship or other education issues. None of the bills became law and only one cleared the state Senate.\nBut is it a sign that he was an ineffective lawmaker?\nThere\u2019s no proof of that.\nDemocrats are in the minority in the General Assembly and so are rarely able to pass legislation. (The same was true for Republicans until, starting with Perdue, the state took a 180-degree turn politically.)\nSteve Anthony, a lecturer in the political science department at Georgia State University, said it\u2019s \"common\" that the party with an absolute majority banishes the minority to near irrelevance.\nHe should know. He was the longtime chief of staff to Tom Murphy, a Democrat who at the time was the nation\u2019s longest-serving state House speaker.\n\"Many Republicans would say they are doing just what Tom Murphy used to do to them,\" Anthony said. \"It\u2019s a game. It\u2019s what\u2019s done in politics, at least on the state level.\"\nThere\u2019s one more point to consider: getting a bill passed and signed is not all that easy, regardless of party.\nIn the 2011 and 2012 legislative sessions, members of the House and Senate introduced 2,514 bills.

We already know this is legal in certain cases under Florida law. Implementation of HB 1247 would limit which courts can make the decisions for women who seek waivers of the parental notification law, not strip their ability to have secret procedures.\n\nFlorida law\n\nThe Florida Statutes have straightforward directions for handling prescription medication at school. The law requires a student\u2019s parent to submit a written statement with the medicine that permits a trained school official to administer a dose. The note must also explain why the medicine must be taken during the school day.\n\nThe prescription medicine must be administered at school by a qualified official and then be counted, stored in the original container, and kept in a secured place.\n\nBeyond that, the law does not address the use of over-the-counter medication. The statutes leave that decision up to local school districts. We set out to check each one to learn if Oelrich's claim is true.\n\nWe tracked down policies for 62 of 67 counties.

(That question\u00a0is based on\n\na photograph of Obama\n\nstanding with his hands folded at his waist while Sen. Hillary Clinton and others have their hands over their hearts. It has been misinterpreted in many chain e-mails as an indication that Obama refuses to say the Pledge of Allegiance, which we addressed\n\nwith this article\n\n.)\n\n\nDuring the\n\nMeet the Press\n\nappearance, Obama is said to have replied, \"As I've said about the flag pin, I don't want to be perceived as taking sides. . . .There are a lot of people in the world to whom the American flag is a symbol of oppression. And the anthem itself conveys a war-like message. You know, the bombs bursting in air and all. It should be swapped for something less parochial and less bellicose.

She also pointed out the legitimate charitable work the foundation carries out, such as its programs addressing AIDS in Africa and storm recovery in Haiti.\n\"The Clinton Foundation is a charity where President and Secretary Clinton and their daughter, they take no salary, they get no money from it, they take no personal benefit from it,\" Rosen said on NPR\u2019s The Diane Rehm Show Aug. 24.\nThat\u2019s a pretty wide gulf between the assertion that the foundation is just a front for the Clintons to make oodles of money and claims that they don\u2019t get any personal benefit. It made us wonder: What exactly do the Clintons get out of the foundation?\nBill Clinton is currently a member of the foundation\u2019s board of directors, while Chelsea Clinton is vice chair. Hillary Clinton was a board member between leaving the State Department in 2013 through the launch of her presidential campaign in 2015. In the most recent year for which tax forms are available, 2014, the foundation reported that Chelsea Clinton worked 35 hours per week for the foundation and other related organizations, Bill Clinton worked 25 hours per work, and Hillary Clinton worked 20 hours per week.\nThe Clintons don\u2019t take a salary from this work, and they don\u2019t receive any other direct monetary benefit. Other Clinton Foundation leaders take home six-figure salaries, according to tax documents.\n\nThe Clinton Foundation is a public charity that, as we have reported, allocates about 80-90 percent of its expenditures to charitable programs, while the rest goes to fundraising and overhead.\n(A quick aside: There\u2019s some confusion over how much the Clinton Foundation spends on charitable programming primarily because the word \"foundation\" is in the name. Typically, a private foundation\u2019s primary activity is grantmaking, giving money to charities who actually do the work. But the Clinton Foundation operates as a public charity in that they run many of their programs themselves. The Clintons also have a traditional private foundation, the Clinton Family Foundation.)\nSo the Clintons don\u2019t receive compensation from the foundation. However, you can make a case that they have received some indirect personal benefits.\nThis is not to say that any of these benefits are unethical or improper. Experts on nonprofit ethics told us these are pretty standard, and they haven\u2019t seen anything reported about the Clinton Foundation that proves corruption.\nStill, it\u2019s worth reviewing the limited types of benefits that the Clintons do get.\nPublic relations\nThe most obvious, outward-facing benefit for the Clintons is notoriety and media attention. The organization got off the ground in 2001, the year Bill Clinton left the White House. During the periods when he or Hillary were not in or running for office, the foundation kept the family in the public eye \u2014 and more often for good reasons, rather than scandalous ones (at least up until the past year or so, when Clinton launched her 2016 campaign and the foundation faced more intense scrutiny).\nThroughout its existence, the Clinton Foundation has received attention for its work to make AIDS medication more accessible in Africa, efforts to combat climate change, establishing a business mentoring program, writing school food guidelines, and more. Every fall, Bill Clinton and his family receive a spate of press as the stars of the annual Clinton Global Initiative, a networking conference for wealthy philanthropic donors. Chelsea Clinton has embraced her role as a public face of the organization.\n\"It does continue to draw attention to the work they do as family and individuals throughout the world,\" said Ann Skeet, director of leadership ethics at Santa Clara University\u2019s Markkula Center for Applied Ethics. \"At a minimum, it is good public relations.\"\nWhen the Internal Revenue Service evaluates charities applying for tax-exempt status, which the foundation has, it wants to ensure that the organization is set up to provide a public benefit rather than serve private financial desires, Skeet said. There\u2019s nothing improper about the Clintons taking advantage of their public image in this role, as long as it goes toward that public benefit.\n\n"}

Louie Gohmert, R-Tyler, sounded downbeat about President Barack Obama\u2019s commitment to securing the U.S.-Mexico border May 10, the day the president spoke on immigration policy in El Paso.\n\nIn an interview on the Georgia-based Martha Zoller Show, Gohmert pointed to two lakes that straddle the border, Falcon Lake and Lake Amistad.\n\nGohmert went on to say he'd recently visited with Texas Gov. Rick Perry and \"they've been begging for the federal government to give us some Coast Guard help\" on the lakes because Texas is \"having to do what the federal government will not and try to patrol the lakes but they, the drug cartels, have spotters, they watch where these guys are; we need Coast Guard down there protecting our border. You\u2019ve got people being smuggled, drugs being smuggled and the president will not lift one finger here to see there is protection.\"\n\nNever mind the president\u2019s fingers; has the state of Texas begged for Coast Guard help on the lakes?\n\nThe lakes are man-made reservoirs about 200 miles apart on the Rio Grande; the international boundary runs down the center of the river channel. According to Alan Cox, superintendent of the Amistad National Recreation Area, Lake Amistad, 12 miles northwest of Del Rio, has had no cartel-tied deaths.\n\nBut on Falcon Lake, about 40 miles east of Laredo, an American jet skiier was gunned down last fall. Stratfor, an Austin intelligence firm, subsequently speculated that the man, who had been viewing Mexican ruins with his wife, was murdered by low-level members of Los Zetas, a drug trafficking group, who were trying to protect the smuggling corridor.\n\nAs reported by The Houston Chronicle in October, the ambush by three boatloads was the fifth reported confrontation with \"pirates\" on the border lake since the spring. It was the first involving a shooting death, followed by a gun chase extending to the U.S. side.\n\nMore recently, the San Antonio Express-News reported that on May 8 Mexican marines patrolling the lake killed 12 presumed Zeta drug gang members in a battle that erupted after the military discovered an island drug encampment.\n\nWhen we sought backup for Gohmert\u2019s statement, his office pointed us to Perry\u2019s Aug. 9 letter to Obama urging additional federal resources to combat \"increasing violence\" on the border. His three-page letter termed insufficient the approved deployment of \"just 286 National Guard personnel\" on the 1,200-mile Texas-Mexico border and revisits Perry\u2019s request for the federal government to send 1,000 National Guard troops to Texas and fly unmanned aircraft on the border.\n\nHis letter does not mention the Coast Guard.\n\nNext, Perry spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger told us the state has not asked the federal government to send the Coast Guard to the lakes. But, she said, Perry has spoken to members of Congress \"about getting Coast Guard (personnel)\" on the lakes. \"It\u2019s pretty damn obvious the governor has been pretty adamant about getting additional (border) resources... however they send them down, that\u2019s great,\" Cesinger said.\n\nIn an email, Department of Homeland Security spokesman Adam Fetcher did not speak directly to Texas seeking Coast Guard help on the lakes. He said, though, that the Coast Guard works with the Border Patrol to \"conduct periodic patrol operations in the (border) area and surge(s) as needed.\"\n\nFetcher specified that the Coast Guard, drawing on personnel based in Corpus Christi and other South Texas locales, conducts periodic operations on Falcon Lake, but he did not mention security on Lake Amisted. Cox later told us the Coast Guard conducts joint lake patrols on Lake Amistad with the National Park Service about four times a year.\n\nCox said one reason there have been no deaths on the lake linked to the illegal drug trade is the presence of many law enforcement officers: The Border Patrol has 20 agents assigned to the lake, the park service has 17 agents and the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department maintains eight game wardens out of nearby Del Rio, he said.\n\nZapata County Sheriff Sigifredo Gonzalez, whose jurisdiction includes Falcon Lake, said by email he was unaware of any request by Gohmert for Coast Guard patrols on Falcon Lake, though he said they would \"do good... and are needed.\" Gonzalez said the Coast Guard already comes to the lake \"once in a while... not very often\" because, he speculated, of budgetary limits.\n\nOur sense: It\u2019s possible Perry has informally talked to some House members about putting the Coast Guard on the lakes--where that force already periodically ventures. But he\u2019s made no formal direct request to the government. That\u2019s far from \"begging\" for Coast Guard deployment"}

The study\u2019s authors note that their dotted line is not statistically significant.\u00a0\nOne of the authors, Roger Pielke Jr., a political scientist in the University of Colorado\u2019s environmental studies program, affirmed Lomborg\u2019s claim about a slight decline. But he also said the latest U.N. report found \"no trend in the frequency of U.S. landfall events.\"\nA finding of \"no trend\" is not the same as finding a downward trend.\nThe decrease was not meaningful, said Christopher Landsea, National Hurricane Center\u2019s chief of Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch.

{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Scott Walker \"Under my predecessor, they cut funding for education, but they didn't give them anything in return to make up for that,\" leading to \"less money\" for school districts", "evidence": "In his March 16, 2013 speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Gov. Scott Walker criticized the way Wisconsin cut education funding before he took office.\n\nIn blaming union rules and former Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle for the layoff of an award-winning young English teacher in Milwaukee Public Schools, Walker explained:\n\n\"You see, under my predecessor, they cut funding for education, but they didn't give them anything in return to make up for that. So what happened? When you have less money in those situations, even though she was named one of the best teachers in the state in her profession, what happened to her?\"\n\nWalker answered his own question:\n\n\"She was one of the first to be laid off. Why? Because under the old system of collective bargaining, one of the last hires is the first fired.\"\n\nWe wondered about Walker\u2019s claim that under Doyle, Democrats cut school funding but didn\u2019t give districts \"anything in return to make up for that,\" resulting in \"less money\" for local districts such as MPS.\n\nSome background first.\n\nIt may not have been well known to Walker\u2019s audience, but as PolitiFact Wisconsin found, Walker and legislative Republicans enacted the biggest cuts to education in state history in his first budget.\n\nBut Walker\u2019s 2011-\u201913 budget also allowed many, but not all, school districts to at least partially offset the impact of those cuts by taking advantage of the union limits in his budget.\n\nSpecifically, they could impose -- rather than attempt to negotiate -- greater cost-sharing from school employees for health insurance and pension benefits. The collective-bargaining curbs also ended protection for seniority, which partly explains the MPS layoff story Walker related.\n\nThat freedom to cut costs is the something \"in return\" that Walker\u2019s speech said Doyle did not provide.\n\nSo let\u2019s look at both the cost and revenue side of the equation as we judge Walker\u2019s claim that Doyle cut school funding and did it in a way that didn\u2019t give local school districts any way to make up for the lost aid.\n\nReductions in state aid\n\nLet\u2019s take the easy part first.\n\nIt\u2019s less well known, but still a fact, that Doyle -- facing a budget shortfall during the Great Recession -- cut state aid to schools in his final budget (2009-\u201911). The cut was about 3 percent in the first year of that Doyle plan, while in the second year school aids were basically flat.\n\nFor the record, Walker\u2019s cut was deeper, about 8 percent in year one of his 2011-\u201913 budget, followed by a 1 percent increase in year two.\n\nBut state aid is just one of the big revenue streams for schools. The other is local property taxes. The state regulates how much state aid and property tax school districts can raise, in combination, by limiting the annual increase in the \"revenue limit\" for each district.\n\n"}

Bush, the governor could go from soaring in public opinion polls to losing at the voting booth next year.\n\nThat\u2019s at least what New Jersey Democratic Party Chairman John Wisniewski suggested last week in response to polls showing rising support for the Republican governor. Christie has announced plans to seek re-election, and Wisniewski has been mentioned as a possible challenger.\n\n\"No one\u2019s unbeatable,\" Wisniewski, a state assemblyman from Middlesex County, said in a Nov. 27 interview on NJToday.\n\nOf Christie\u2019s rising poll numbers, Wisniewski later added: \"It\u2019s interesting.

However, by January 1992, the 41st president\u2019s approval rating had dropped to less than 50 percent.\n\nAlicia D\u2019Alessandro, a spokeswoman for Wisniewski, told us the party chairman meant to reference March 1991, when a Washington Post/ABC News poll gave Bush a 90 percent approval rating.\n\n\"It seems that Chairman Wisniewski incorrectly identified the date of the poll, which can happen when you're discussing events from about two decades ago,\" D\u2019Alessandro said in an e-mail. \"Still, the chairman was making a point about poll numbers representing a snapshot in time, and that point still stands.\"\n\nTo evaluate Wisniewski\u2019s claim, we turned to presidential approval data from Gallup, which is considered one of the leading assessments of presidential performance. Gallup has measured presidential job approval ratings since Franklin D. Roosevelt was commander-in-chief.\n\nAs the Gulf War ended, Bush garnered an approval rating of 89 percent, according to a Gallup poll conducted in late February and early March of 1991. That figure would turn out to be the highest approval rating of Bush\u2019s presidency, as measured by Gallup.\n\nThen, driven in part by a staggering economy, Bush\u2019s numbers nose-dived. The president\u2019s approval rating gradually went down throughout the rest of 1991 before landing at 46 percent in January 1992, according to Gallup.\n\nOther polls around the same time turned up similar results for the president. A Washington Post/ABC News poll gave Bush a 45 percent approval rating, and in a New York Times/CBS News Poll, 43 percent said they approved of his performance as president.\n\nA few weeks before losing his re-election bid to Clinton, Bush\u2019s approval rating stood at 34 percent, according to Gallup.\n\nWhile Bush\u2019s approval ratings showed a sharp drop in support, the latest poll numbers for Christie demonstrate an upswing at a time when the governor has been widely praised for his leadership during Hurricane Sandy.\n\nA Quinnipiac University poll released on Tuesday put Christie's approval rating at 72 percent, marking a 16-point increase over his 56 percent approval rating in a Quinnipiac poll from October.\n\nIn a poll released Tuesday by Rutgers University\u2019s Eagleton Institute of Politics, Christie was viewed favorably by 67 percent of respondents, compared to 48 percent in a Rutgers-Eagleton poll released in early October.\n\n\"The realities of governing \u2013 including the budget and a host of other contentious issues \u2013 are likely to cool the governor\u2019s red-hot numbers over time,\" David Redlawsk, director of the Rutgers-Eagleton Poll and a political science professor, said in a news release.\n\nOur ruling\n\nComparing Christie with the 41st president, Wisniewski claimed in a TV interview that in January 1992, Bush \"probably had a 90 percent or even higher approval rating after the first Gulf War.\"\n\n"}

That was a phrase invented by the last administration to make Americans stupid. There has never been a serious attack or a serious plot that was unconnected from ISIS or al-Qaida.

It\u2019s bogus.\"\nHowever, Gorka\u2019s assertions are flawed, several terrorism experts told PolitiFact. (The White House did not provide any additional explanation in response to an inquiry.)\nThe lone wolf as a metaphor for independent terrorism clearly pre-dated the Obama administration. We\u2019ll also note that Gorka\u2019s claim that there has \"never\" been a serious plot unconnected from ISIS or al-Qaida is dubious.\nThe term lone wolf 'was a phrase invented by the last administration'\nThis is easily debunked. Just look at a few of the books that used the term in the context of terrorism before Obama took office in January 2009:\n\u2022 Brian T. Bennett, Understanding, Assessing, and Responding to Terrorism: Protecting Critical Infrastructure and Personnel, 2007: \"Lone wolf terrorism involves individual extremists who usually operate alone or on the fringes of established extremist groups, inflicting serious harm or causing significant damage.\"\n\u2022 Jeffrey F. Addicott, Winning the War on Terror: Legal and Policy Lessons from the Past, 2002: \"Because they operate on their own, without affiliation to any known group or state, individuals who engage in \u2018lone-wolf terrorism\u2019 are far harder to predict, track, or deter.\"\n\u2022 Linda Jacobs Altman, Hate and Racist Groups: A Hot Issue, 2001: \"The lone wolf and leaderless cell became part of the new face of racist terrorism in the 1990s.\"\nIn addition, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 amended the definition of an \"agent of a foreign power\" to include a \"lone wolf\" category. The provision was widely known as the \"lone wolf\" amendment.\nSo, how far back does the term go? Experts said that its specific application to terrorism originated with the ideas of white nationalist Louis Beam, who in the early 1980s advocated \"leaderless resistance.\" Tom Metzger, the founder of the group White Aryan Resistance, advocated a similar approach.\nThe idea \"was adopted by American right-wing extremists in response to a federal law enforcement crackdown on domestic terrorists during the 1980s,\" said Mark Hamm, an Indiana State University criminologist who coauthored the book The Age of Lone Wolf Terrorism. \"Leaderless resistance is based on the idea that a terrorist group, no matter how secret or well-organized, simply cannot evade law enforcement, so terrorism is more readily accomplished by individual actors rather than a group.\"\nIn 1998, FBI agents in San Diego opened \"Operation Lone Wolf\" -- an investigation into the criminal activities of a self-proclaimed white supremacist, Alex Curtis. The following year, a widely noted New York Times article was headlined, \"New Face of Terror Crimes: 'Lone Wolf' Weaned on Hate.\"\n\n"}

The bill did a few things. First up, it offered a 13-week extension in unemployment benefits. Second, it allowed those who were receiving unemployment benefits to turn down work, so long as they were enrolled in a worker training program and the job paid less than 110 percent of minimum wage.\n\nThe measure passed pretty overwhelmingly in the House with 47 members voting in favor. It was the same story in the Senate where 25 voted \"yes.\" Starr, however, was one of four who voted \"no.\"\n\n\"At the time, Bruce Starr's vote would have thrown 6,000 Oregonians off unemployment,\" the press release alleges.\n\nPolitiFact Oregon decided to do a little digging.\n\nFirst, we pulled up the legislative fiscal analysis of the bill. It mentioned that 2,400 additional claimants would be added to the program each year if the bill passed, but it didn\u2019t say anything about 6,000 people losing their benefits.\n\nWe asked folks at the Democratic Party of Oregon where they got the number and they pointed us to a story that appeared in The Oregonian, which attributed the figure to \"the state.\"Still, we needed the actual source.\n\nAfter a few more phone calls, we were pointed toward Craig Spivey, a spokesman with the Oregon Employment Department. He confirmed the number. Back when the bill was passed, folks could stay on unemployment for about 100 weeks, thanks to a series of federal and state extensions passed for the recession. That time frame has since been reduced to the more standard 26 weeks.\n\nWe called Sen. Starr to see why he voted the way he did on the legislation. He said he was more concerned about the change in policy that allowed (albeit temporarily) those on unemployment to turn down work.\n\n\"That's a significant departure,\" he said. \"The goal is, we need people to get back to work, we need to create an environment where people have jobs.\"\n\nWithout the bill, it\u2019s clear, based on numbers from the Unemployment Department, that 6,000 people would have been cycled off unemployment. (In fact, that number is closer to 12,000 if you consider the full life of the extension.) That said, we think there\u2019s a difference between voting against an extension and actively voting to kick people off of something -- as the Democrats allege. Moreover, the bill wasn\u2019t a matter of a simple extension; it also temporarily allowed certain beneficiaries to turn down work.\n\nIn the end, we think the claim is partially accurate but leaves out some important context. We rate this claim Half True.\n\n\nCORRECTION: Democratic Reps.

What Culbreath sent us -- and what we found elsewhere -- was that over the years, pro-gun advocates obtained separate data from state officials on gator attacks and gun license revocations and combined them to make such a comparison. In fact, this claim even made its way to the Connecticut General Assembly when politicians there considered a handgun\u00a0safety bill in 1998.\nFor example, one website wrote it this way in 1999: \u00a0\"Do firearms carry laws result in chaos? No. Consider the case of Florida. A citizen in the Sunshine State is almost twice as likely to be attacked by an alligator than to be assaulted by a concealed carry holder.

In his analysis, Beckley counts the Organization of American States, NATO and various other treaties as collective defense arrangements.\nWe found that other sources include fewer countries. The State Department only counts 54.\nWe analyzed all of the treaties Beckley cites and compared it to U.S. Department of State records.\nThe Charter of The Organization of American States created the OAS \u2014 an organization that aims for regional solidarity in the Americas \u2014 and was approved by the Senate in 1951. The OAS Charter treaty pledges the United States to support 33 countries through collective security provisions in Articles 28 and 29, according to Beckley.\nThose countries include \u2014 Antigua & Barbuda, Argentina, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Hait\u00ed, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Per\u00fa, St. Kitts & Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Suriname, Trinidad & Tobago, Uruguay and Venezuela.\nBeckley\u2019s analysis also includes 28 countries as part of NATO, which was created by the North Atlantic Treaty and approved by the Senate on July 21, 1949. Article V of the NAT provides for collective defense.\nIn that list, Beckley includes \u2014 Albania, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, West Germany and Germany.\nThose two agreements count for 61 of the 69 countries Johnson cited. Both were approved by the Senate, but more on that later.\nNext, Beckley cites the Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty of 1951, which was also approved by the Senate on March 20, 1952.\nThat makes countries 62 and 63.\nBeckley also includes Japan as country 64 through a bilateral U.S.-Japan treaty (approved by the Senate on March 20, 1952), South Korea (65) through a mutual defense treaty (approved by the Senate on January 26, 1954), and the Philippines (66) through a mutual defense treaty (approved by the Senate on March 20, 1952).\nHe also cites a bilateral defense agreement with Pakistan (67) on March 5, 1959. According to Dennis Kux in his book on U.S.-Pakistan relations, this was an \"executive agreement\" \u2014 a different type of treaty not sent to the Senate for approval. Pakistan has since accused the United States of not honoring the agreement, Kux wrote.\nIsrael (68) and Taiwan (69) are also on Beckley\u2019s list. He includes Israel because he claims the United States has a \"de facto\" agreement to defend it (not a formal treaty). The Taiwan Relations Act, passed by Congress in 1979, requires the United States to provide defense assistance to Taiwan.\n\n"}

Opponents have assailed the state\u2019s tax incentive package, arguing the money could be better spent on road improvements, education and health care.

The Corps, however, still had the power to weigh in on the project.\nThe legislation also exempted Foxconn from some environmental requirements, allowing the company to fill in wetlands that are regulated by the state and change the course of streams.\nSo, the paragraphs from the article are mostly -- but not entirely -- on target with Flynn\u2019s claim.\n\n"}

So Guadagno is correct that the governor has not actually raised any of those taxes.\nBut other actions by the governor cut tax relief for those who relied on support from programs such as the Earned Income Tax Credit and other credits. In the eyes of some experts that means certain New Jerseyans had less money to pay their taxes, and the impact of the cuts was essentially a tax increase for those residents.\nThe EITC is a credit given certain residents who work and have earned income. It reduces the amount of New Jersey tax owed and may result in a refund, even if those eligible for the credit owe the state no taxes, according to the state Treasury Department.\nTreasury Department spokesman Bill Quinn has said that in many cases, the EITC represented a subsidy to low-income people, and more than three-quarters of New Jerseyans who received the credit in 2010 actually owed the state no tax.\n\n"}

There are 2.3 million concealed weapon permit holders.\nCriminal activity can cost someone their license, at least temporarily.\nState law requires the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services to suspend a concealed carry gun permit when a person is arrested or charged with a crime that would disqualify a person from having a license. This includes any felony offense as well as certain misdemeanors, such as multiple DUIs or drug crimes.\nFor the most recent year ending in June 2021, the state revoked 1,050 licenses and suspended about 7,300.\nUnder Florida law, a concealed weapon or firearm license is a private record \u2014 which means we don\u2019t know which Jan. 6 defendants had their permits suspended, and so we also don\u2019t know their specific charges.\nA spokesperson for the department would not reveal which charges were at play, saying it received the information about the defendants from the U.S. Department of Justice.\nSuspensions are a temporary action \u2014 an interim step to a potential revocation. And state law spells out the mandate for suspensions. It says when the department is notified by a law enforcement agency or a court, it shall suspend a license of a person arrested or charged with a crime that would disqualify the person from having a license until final disposition of the case. Also, the department shall suspend a license of a person who is issued an injunction that restrains the person from committing acts of domestic violence or repeat violence.\nThe Justice Department has charged more than 550 people in connection with the Capitol siege, according to a database run by the George Washington University Center on Extremism.

According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the plan would cost in the neighborhood of $1 trillion over 10 years.\n\n\nBut would it mean \"big tax increases, even on health benefits?\"\n\n\nThe answer: It depends. There is not a single health care plan, there are several versions kicking around various committees in the House and Senate. And they have different approaches on how the plan would be paid for.\n\n\nMost of the discussion has focused on the the House plans because there is not a detailed Senate version yet. In the House plan, the tax increases are targeted at the wealthy. So if you make $1 million a year, yes, the plan would mean a big tax increase.\n\n\nWe can be even more precise. The House versions of the bill would help pay for the health plan with a surtax on high earners that would break down as follows: for couples making between $350,000 and $500,000 (or $280,000 to $400,000 for individuals), a new 1 percent tax; between $500,000 and $1 million ($400,000 to $800,000 for individuals), 1.5 percent; and over $1 million (or over $800,000 for individuals), 5.4 percent.

What\u2019s with Georgia Republicans and food stamps lately?\n\nLast week, the state\u2019s other presidential contender, Newt Gingrich, said Obama deserves to be called \"the most successful food stamp president in American history\" because \"47 million Americans are on food stamps.\"\n\nWe ruled Gingrich\u2019s statement Half True. For the most part, Gingrich got his facts straight but oversimplified who was to blame.\n\nCain, a former radio talk show host and Godfather\u2019s Pizza CEO, urged the crowd at his rally to \"look at the facts.\" PolitiFact Georgia is all to happy to oblige him. \u00a0\n\nFood stamps, officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, give certain low-income Americans vouchers to buy groceries.\n\nThe most recent data show roughly 44.2 million people received SNAP benefits in February, the most recent data available.\n\nCain\u2019s numbers aren\u2019t quite accurate, but he\u2019s close. The number of recipients has topped 44 million since December, which means his estimate is about 7 percent too high. \u00a0\n\nThe number of beneficiaries has climbed every single month since Obama took office, despite signs of an improving economy. According to historical data, February\u2019s count appears to be the highest in any month since the program was established in 1969.\n\nObama took office in January 2009. That month, nearly 32 million people received SNAP benefits. That means the number of food stamp recipients has increased by about 12.2 million since the start of his administration.\n\nCain placed the increase at 14 million, which is about 15 percent too high. Again, he\u2019s close, but not quite right.\n\nWhether Obama deserves the blame for the increase is far less clear.\n\nThe rise in food stamps is a direct consequence of the Great Recession, which started more than a year before Obama took office. Conservatives and liberals agree that Obama inherited a troubled economy. Whether SNAP usage would have been lower if Republicans won the presidency is impossible to tell.\n\nThe number of food stamp beneficiaries ticked upward under President George W. Bush because of policies that broadened eligibility for the program and more aggressive efforts to get eligible Americans to apply for benefits. These policies remained in place under Obama.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAnother reason assigning blame is tough is that there is typically a lag between when the broader economy begins to recover and when SNAP usage declines. The monthly growth has slowed for the past three months, and it could start declining in a month or two.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCain\u2019s accusation against Obama was not as barbed as Gingrich\u2019s, but he did lay the blame for food stamp usage at the president\u2019s feet"}
{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Democratic National Committee Says Mitt Romney flip-flopped on supporting \"the president's Recovery Act.\"", "evidence": "On Nov. 28, 2011, the Democratic National Committee released two videos designed to paint Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney as a serial flip-flopper. The shorter, 30-second version gives a taste of the attack, specifically citing abortion and health care, and directs viewers to a website with a four-minute version that offers alleged flip-flops on a variety of other issues.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFor this item, we\u2019ll check one of the claims from the four-minute version -- specifically, whether Romney has changed his position on President Barack Obama\u2019s stimulus plan, officially known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. We're looking at other aspects of the ad in separate items.\n\nHere\u2019s the relevant portion from the DNC ad:\n\nOn-screen text: \"Opposed the stimulus\"\n\nVideo clip of Romney: \"I have never supported the president's Recovery Act, alright -- the stimulus. No time, nowhere, nohow.\"\n\nOn-screen text: \"After he was for it.\"\n\nDifferent video clip of Romney: \"I think there is need for economic stimulus.\"\n\nWe asked the DNC for citations for these clips, and they responded that the first one came from a town hall at St. Anselm College in Goffstown, N.H., on Sept. 28, 2011, and the second one came from a Romney appearance on CNN\u2019s Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer on Jan. 4, 2009.\n\nUpon learning this, we immediately noticed that the CNN interview -- when Romney said, \"I think there is need for economic stimulus\" -- took place before Obama had even been sworn into office and therefore came before there was an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.\n\nTo get the full context of the CNN interview, we looked to the transcript.\n\nBlitzer said that Obama, then president-elect, was \"talking about a $750 billion economic stimulus package. He wants it to be passed as soon as possible. It's unclear if whether it can be passed before he's inaugurated on January 20th. What do you think about this proposal?\"\n\nRomney replied, \"Well, I frankly wish that the last Congress (had) dealt with the stimulus issue and that the president could have signed that before leaving office. I think there is need for economic stimulus. Americans have lost about $11 trillion in net worth. That translates into about $400 billion a year less spending that they'll be doing, and that's net of additional government programs like Medicaid and unemployment insurance. And government can help make that up in a very difficult time. And that's one of the reasons why I think a stimulus program is needed.\"\n\nHe continued, \"I'd move quickly. These are unusual times. But it has to be something which relieves pressure on middle-income families. I think a tax cut is necessary for them as well as for businesses that are growing. We'll be investing in infrastructure and in energy technologies. But let's not make this a Christmas tree of all of the favors for various politicians who have helped out the Obama campaign, giving them special projects. That would be wrong. You'll see Republicans fight that tooth and nail if that happens. Let's do what's right for the economy, and let's not do what's a political expedient move.\"\n\nThe DNC ad has some support for its flip-flop claim. Romney did indeed say, \"I think there is need for economic stimulus,\" and at the time of the interview, there was in fact an outline of a stimulus plan from Obama.\n\nBut it\u2019s misleading to say Romney flip-flopped on supporting \"the president's Recovery Act.\" At the time of the CNN interview, no Obama stimulus bill had been introduced, much less enacted. With such complex bills, the devil\u2019s in the details. Given that Romney outlined a whole list of conditions he\u2019d impose on such a bill, we think it\u2019s unfair for the DNC to say Romney once supported \"the president's Recovery Act.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn the CNN interview, Romney expressed support broadly for \"economic stimulus\" -- not for a specific measure known as \"the president's Recovery Act.\" And even as he offered his support for the concept of stimulus, Romney articulated a pretty specific vision of the kind of bill he\u2019d support. Some of this vision did ultimately overlap with what the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act offered -- tax relief for \"middle-income families\" and businesses, for instance, and investments in infrastructure and energy. But Romney\u2019s two comments can be easily reconciled by arguing that the dollar amounts in the Obama stimulus bill -- or the ratios of various provisions in the bill -- went beyond what he was envisioning"}

{"label": "true", "claim": "Lincoln Chafee \"The five economic indicators that the federal government tracks - for the first time since August 2006 - were positive this October.\"", "evidence": "\"Are we there yet?\"\n\nAnyone who has driven the family to a vacation on Cape Cod has heard that question rise up from the back seats, a plaintive cry for progress as the traffic crawls toward the Bourne Bridge.\n\nAfter four straight years of unemployment over 9 percent, Rhode Islanders wonder how long their road to economic recovery is going to be. Governor Chafee made the case earlier this month that, though it\u2019s been slow going, the state is making progress.\n\nIn a Dec. 1 interview with The Providence Journal about his plans for the state Economic Development Commission, Chafee said the state isn\u2019t getting enough credit for the progress it has made on the economy, particularly this year.\n\n\"We're seeing unemployment going in the right direction, for the last six months,\" he said. \"The five economic indicators that the federal government tracks -- for the first time since August 2006 -- were positive this October.\"\n\nWe weren\u2019t sure which indicators he was talking about or whether they were actually all in positive territory, so we decided to check.\n\nThe state and federal governments track the labor market through a variety of statistics. The most commonly watched by the public is the unemployment rate. But other indices are used too.\n\nThe numbers don\u2019t always \u00a0move in the same direction. Improvement in one can be offset by setbacks in another. For example, \u00a0if the size of the workforce goes down but the number of unemployed stays the same, the unemployment rate will go up.\n\nChafee was touting the five indicators for the month of September (they were released in October, hence his reference to them as October numbers), because the bad numbers (concerning unemployment) all fell and the good numbers (employment) all rose, and all at the same time.\n\nLaura Hart, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Labor and Training, said the five federal categories Chafee was referring to are the same key indicators the state tracks, through data approved by the federal Department of Labor.\n\nHere are the indicators for Rhode Island, and how they changed from August to September, as reported by the state DLT:\n- The unemployment rate dropped from 10.7 to 10.5 percent\n- The number of unemployed people dropped from 59,221 to 58,663\n- The number of employed people (at jobs in Rhode Island and nearby states) increased from 495,480 to 499,480\n- The total work force (the number of people available to work) went up from 554,701 to 558,143\n- The number of in-state jobs went from 456,000 to 459,500 .\n\nThe last time those five indices all went in the right direction was from July to August of 2006, when the unemployment rate went from 5.1 to 5 percent.\n\nSo Chafee was right.\n\nDLT spokeswoman Laura Hart cautioned that the month-to-month figures are extrapolations from polling of residents and employers and could be revised in March, when employers file tax information.\n\nShe compared it to the difference between a poll and an election.\n\nChafee is not alone in seeing some movement, however slow, in the state\u2019s economic recovery. University of Rhode Island economics Prof. Leonard Lardaro has commented on the underappreciated progress the state is making, but noted that it seems to come in fits and starts.\n\n\"While Rhode Island\u2019s economy remained in a recovery, the magnitude of which almost nobody in this state seems to fully comprehend, the pace of that recovery tapered off a bit in September following a very strong August,\" Lardaro wrote in his Rhode Island economics blog Nov. 12.\n\nIn a report prepared for the Dec. 6 Fall Economic Outlook Conference hosted by the New England Economic Partnership at Bryant University, Edward M. Mazze, a former dean and current business professor at the University of Rhode Island, \u00a0and Edinaldo Tebaldi, associate economics professor at Bryant, noted the state\u2019s sluggish recovery rate, predicting that Rhode Island\u2019s unemployment rate may not fall below 7 percent until 2016.\n\nOur ruling\n\nGovernor Chafee said five economic indicators tracked by the federal government went up in October, the first time they\u2019ve done so in the same month in six years.\n\nRegardless of whether you believe the state has finally turned the economic corner, he got the facts right.\n\nWe find his statement True.\n\u00a0\n(If you have a claim you\u2019d like us to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com.

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Chris Abele Says Milwaukee County buses are no less safe now than a year or two ago.", "evidence": "A spate of diametrically opposed claims about safety on Milwaukee County buses is the latest product of the increasingly bitter battle between Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. and County Executive Chris Abele.\n\nThe sheriff, whose agency helps police buses, released videos of student fights to dramatize that, as he put it, \"a ride on a Milwaukee county bus has become a frightening experience.\"\n\nThe bad news aboard or around buses in December 2011 included a fight culminating in an attack against a mother who was with a 2-year-old child, an assault against a driver, a road-rage episode and stunning footage of beatings of students.\n\nTaking a somewhat longer view, Abele told reporters there is no disturbing new trend.\n\n\"I think he\u2019s misrepresenting the facts,\" Abele told CBS 58 TV reporter. \"If the sheriff has given you the impression that transit is less safe than it was a year ago or the year before that, then he\u2019s giving the wrong impression.\"\n\nWe\u2019ll focus on that two-year time period, but also peek at how Clarke can say incidents on buses have spiked five years in a row since 2006, while Abele cites a big drop comparing 2011 to 2006.\n\nThis dispute escalated to the point that Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn stepped in to have his officers patrol buses, which prompted Clarke and Flynn to hammer at each other.\n\nBoth Clarke and Abele referred to data on \"incidents\" when we asked. But Clarke couldn\u2019t show us numbers to back up his assertion of a five-year rise. Abele did produce transit system figures, but his claim of a drop comparing 2011 to 2006 is misleading because he compared the present to a high point.\n\nIn any event, the \"incidents\" figures are highly diluted. They include many hundreds of problems so minor -- sleeping on the bus, for example -- that neither law enforcement nor the transit system\u2019s private security force was called in to deal with them.\n\nSo let\u2019s stick to more serious incidents -- and Abele\u2019s statement about the last two years. We\u2019ll look at violence, lawbreaking and other security problems that required intervention by law enforcement or G4S, the private security company formerly known as Wackenhut.\n\nHere\u2019s our analysis of figures provided by the Milwaukee County Transit System (2011 figures are through Dec. 20).\n\nLaw enforcement responses: This is arguably the most important measurement, and the trend line goes up -- though in roller-coaster fashion around 600 responses per year.\n\nPolice were called in 12 percent more often in 2010 than in 2009, but those cases were on pace to fall about 5 percent in 2011 compared to 2010. So, buses were less safe this year than in 2009, but more safe this year than in 2010.\n\nBut if you look at the last two years mentioned by Abele, and compare the responses from the previous two years, they are up slightly, about 4 percent.\n\nAll responses: Counting all instances when police and/or private security was needed, incidents went up the last two years. This year, compared to 2009, they are up more than 13 percent.\n\nThose are the broad numbers for police and private security responses. But there are hundreds of non-criminal episodes such as fare disputes included, though, so let\u2019s take a closer look at the violent incidents.\n\nAssaults and verbal altercations against passengers: Security was called -- and law enforcement sometimes dispatched -- \u00a0in 150 such cases in 2011, up from 139 in 2010 and 106 in 2009. That\u2019s two years in a row of increases, though it moderated in 2011, according to a report MCTS ran for us.\n\nAssaults against drivers: This counts drivers struck by a person, but mainly by objects or fluids (such as spittle). There were 29 such incidents in 2009, 24 in 2010 and 25 this year. It\u2019s fallen off more compared to 35 in 2008. There were six drivers struck by individuals in 2011, though not all of these cases were serious enough to warrant medical attention.\n\nNon-violent lawbreaking: We only have two years of data here. It was virtually unchanged at nearly 900 incidents per year, this category includes threats, weapons incidents, off-bus fights and disorderly conduct, vandalism and profane/drunken behavior. The number represents how many time private security -- and police in some cases -- were called in.\n\nThose are the numbers.\n\nA transit spokeswoman sees no red flags in the fluctuations and mixed trends.\n\n\"There\u2019s not an increase in crime, there\u2019s an increase in attention,\" said Jacqueline Janz of MCTS.\n\nThe numbers are a bit of a mixed bag, but show lawbreaking and violence is a consistent, if relatively uncommon, phenomenon on county buses that -- MCTS officials are quick to point out -- provide 44 million passenger trips a year on 411 buses, most without incident.\n\nBroadly speaking, it\u2019s happening less now than five years ago, but more than it was two years ago, based on total responses by police and security. The Abele statement we are checking referred to the last two years.\n\nAssaults on drivers are notably down over two to three years.\n\nBut looking at the broadest measure of serious problems (altercations among passengers), the history shows a significant increase two years in a row. That\u2019s the time frame Abele referred to, and we think Clarke\u2019s critique focuses mainly on these kind of serious incidents.\n\nTo be sure, there\u2019s no dramatic swing up, as Clarke\u2019s rhetoric implied. And the picture improves when the longer view is taken, though as we noted that\u2019s selectively taking a high point as the starting point.\n\nBut Abele\u2019s claim about buses being no less safe than a year or two ago flies in the face of the passenger altercation stats. Plus, Abele makes use of overly broad \"incident\" numbers that are highly misleading as a measure of crime.\n\nThere\u2019s enough counter evidence -- the declining number of bus drivers struck -- to give Abele\u2019s claim an element of truth. But it also gives a wrong impression"}

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Bob Goodlatte \"Before taking executive action on immigration, President Obama stated 22 times that he does not have the authority to change immigration laws on his own.\"", "evidence": "U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte says it should be a no-brainer for the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down President Barack Obama\u2019s stalled program to shield millions of immigrants from deportation and allow them to work in the country legally.\nThe high court heard arguments April 19 on whether Obama exceeded his authority in late 2014 by going around Congress and launching the program via executive order. Goodlatte, in a statement issued the day of the hearing, said the court should be guided by the past words of the president himself.\n\"Before taking executive action on immigration, President Obama stated 22 times that he does not have the authority to change immigration laws on his own,\" said Goodlatte, R-6th.\nObama\u2019s program would delay deportation of immigrants who have lived illegally in the U.S. for more than five years but have children who are citizens or have green cards. If applicants pass background checks and pay a fee, they could qualify for a work permit and avoid deportation for at least three years. More than 4 million people could qualify for the program.\nThe president announced the program Nov. 20, 2014, after House Republicans didn\u2019t act on a comprehensive immigration reform bill. Twenty-six states, not including Virginia, have sued to stop the program and have won before a federal district court judge in Texas and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\nWe decided to examine Goodlatte\u2019s claim that Obama said 22 times that he lacked the power to change immigration laws by himself. It\u2019s a claim that\u2019s been made by many Republicans. The source, according to Goodlatte\u2019s statement, is a list blogged on Nov. 19, 2014, by then-House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.\nLet\u2019s first discuss the problems with Boehner\u2019s list. Four of the quotes Boehner cited do not mention immigration but were general statements Obama made as a candidate for president about limiting the use of executive orders - a power he accused his predecessor, Republican George W. Bush, of abusing. In another quote flagged by Boehner, Obama actually was talking about his inability to end the military\u2019s now-defunct \"don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\" policies on homosexuality.\nThat leaves, by our count, 17 Obama statements on the list that go to the heart of Goodlatte\u2019s claim. Here\u2019s a sampling:\nMarch 28, 2011\nDuring a town hall meeting at Bell Multicultural High School in the District of Columbia, Obama was asked if he could issue an executive order to stop deportation of undocumented high school students. The president dismissed the idea.\nObama said, \"With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive orders, that\u2019s just not the case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed - and I know that everybody here at Bell is studying hard, so you know that we\u2019ve got three branches of government. Congress passes the law. The executive branch\u2019s job is to enforce and implement those laws. And then the judiciary has to interpret the laws.\n\"There are enough laws on the books that are very clear in terms of how we enforce our immigration system that for me to, simply through executive order, ignore these constitutional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as president. That does not mean, though, that we can\u2019t make decisions, for example, to emphasize enforcement on those who\u2019ve engaged in criminal activity.\"\nJan. 30, 2013\nDuring an interview with Univision, a Spanish-language television network, Obama was asked if he would consider a moratorium on deportations of non-criminal immigrants.\n\n"}
{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Alan Grayson \"The Republican plan for tax cuts is to give each millionaire -- the top 1 percent of income in this country -- $83,347 a year in tax cuts.\"", "evidence": "File this under the category of things that won't surprise you -- Alan Grayson isn't leaving office quietly.\n\nThe Orlando Democrat who lost his bid for re-election took to the U.S. House floor on Nov. 17, 2010, to rail against Republicans who want to extend the Bush 2001 and 2003 tax cuts for all Americans, including the wealthiest 1 percent of income earners.\n\nWith a series of cardboard posters, Grayson mocked Republicans for more than five minutes. \"The Republican plan for tax cuts is to give each millionaire -- each person who makes $1.4 million a year on average, the top 1 percent of income in this country, the high and mighty -- $83,347 a year in tax cuts,\" Grayson said, turning to his posters.\n\nGrayson said the wealthiest could use the money to buy a 2011 Mercedes-Benz E-Class sedan, once a year, every year for the next decade. Or they could buy a Hermes \"Birkin\" handbag every year or a bottle of 1787 Chateau d'Yquem wine.\n\n\"Here's something else they can do,\" Grayson said, showing the next poster. \"They can buy 20,000 jars of their favorite mustard, Grey Poupon. Twenty thousand jars. That's certainly enough for them, their family, their friends, even a few poor people.\n\n\"Thank you Republican Party.\"\n\nGrayson came back on Nov. 18, 2010, and continued poking the GOP -- saying the money could be used to buy three tickets to the most expensive suite at the Super Bowl, to climb Mt. Everest, or for a 110-day couple's cruise around the world. (\"Not just one year, but every single year,\" he said.)\n\nGrayson's point is that the money could be better used creating jobs than going to America's top earners. That the country could essentially take the money and hire 3 million people at $30,000 a year, creating jobs instead of lining the pockets of the rich. There's some false logic in his thinking, at least from the Republican point of view. Republicans say it's those top earners who create jobs and taking money out of their pockets will cost jobs. Grayson also certainly is guilty of hyperbole in suggesting that the rich will use the money saved from the tax cuts only on outrageous luxury items.\n\nBut that's all a philosophical debate we'll let you have at your dinner tables.\n\nFor PolitiFact Florida, we wanted to zero in on his baseline number, that the Republican plan for extending the 2001, 2003 and other Bush-era tax cuts would result in the top 1 percent of earners\u00a0paying $83,347 a year less in taxes.\n\nGrayson said his figure comes from an analysis provided by a liberal public policy group called Citizens for Tax Justice.\n\nCitizens for Tax Justice Legislative Director Steve Wamhoff backs up Grayson's numbers, saying that if all of the tax cuts scheduled to expire at the end of this year remain in place, the top 1 percent of earners will save $83,347 on average. But there's more to the story, Wamhoff said.\n\nFirst, extending all of the Bush-era tax cuts for everyone isn't exactly \"the Republican plan.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell introduced a bill on Sept. 13 that would extend most of the Bush-era tax cuts, and would restore\u00a0the estate tax, at some level,\u00a0for some people.\u00a0The effect of the McConnell bill is that the top 1 percent of income earners would see a total cut of $74,621, according to Citizens for Tax Justice.\n\nAnother bill filed on Nov. 17 by Republicans\u00a0Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana\u00a0and Sen. Jim DeMint of\u00a0South Carolina\u00a0would permanently repeal the estate tax for everyone, meaning the top 1 percent would see the cut suggested by Grayson -- $83,347, using Citizens for Tax Justice numbers.\n\nAnd there's a second caveat. Democrats, including President Barack Obama, want to extend some of the tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans too. Just not to the extent that Republicans do.\n\nWhile President Obama's preferred alternative is to extend the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts for only those individuals making $200,000 or less and couples making $250,000 or less, he does support extending other tax cuts that would benefit wealthier Americans, including\u00a0restoring a reduced\u00a0estate tax.\u00a0Under Obama's plan, the top 1 percent of earners would pay $28,728 a year less in taxes than they would if all of the tax cuts were allowed to expire at the end of the year, according to Citizens for Tax Justice.\n\nHow does this all add up?\n\nIf all of the tax cuts are allowed to expire, the wealthiest 1 percent will pay around $83,347 a year more in federal taxes on average.\n\nIf President Obama's plan is approved, the wealthiest 1 percent will pay about $54,619 a year more in federal taxes than they do now.\n\nIf McConnell's bill passes, they'll pay $8,726 a year more.\n\nAnd if the DeMint/Pence plan passes, they'll pay the same amount.\n\nNow we know you're probably wondering if Citizens for Tax Justice's numbers are credible, especially since they define themselves as being liberal. We did, too. So we also checked with the Tax Policy Center, an independent, nonpartisan think tank. They didn't measure things exactly like Citizens for Tax Justice, but they did corroborate one critical fact. They found that if President Obama's tax plan becomes law, the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans would pay $53,674 a year more, on average, in federal taxes (CTJ's number\u00a0was $54,619).\n\nWe also found research from the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation -- a nonpartisan committee with a professional staff of economists, attorneys and accountants -- that helps illustrate the same point, though by using slightly different criteria. The Joint Committee on Taxation found that, for those who have income of $1 million or more, extending all of the Bush tax cuts would mean $32.7 billion that the government would not collect in 2011. That amount would apply to 315,000 tax filers. Divide the foregone tax revenues by the number of filers, and you get $103,809 per tax filer. That's a bigger number than Citizens for Tax Justice, but also applies to a different pool of people.\n\nAnd it substantiates Grayson's broader point, which is that extending the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans means they will save a lot of money in federal taxes.\n\nIn a pair of dramatic House floor speeches, he said that the Republican plan to extend the Bush-era tax cuts would result in the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans saving $83,347 a year.

In many states, there are grassroots movements encouraging parents to refuse to allow their children to take the tests.\nRetired teacher Sheila Resseger raised that issue in a Jan. 10, 2015 Providence Journal commentary critical of standardized testing.\nIn her piece, \"Students can opt out of new tests in R.I,\" Resseger said that \"by spring 2014, parents of 60,000 students in New York state had refused to let them take the Common Core tests.\"\nResseger also said there would be no penalty for Rhode Island students who opt out of taking the state\u2019s first set of Common Core-related tests, the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC), which are to be given this spring. \u00a0\nBecause the debate over Common Core has been so intense, in Rhode Island and elsewhere, we were curious if Resseger was right about the number of testing opt-outs in New York.\nThe 60,000 number has been widely reported in newspaper and TV stories, almost always without attribution. It turned out to be a surprisingly difficult number to pin down.\nWe started with \u00a0Resseger, who referred us to a flier that included the 60,000 figure put out by NYS Allies for Public Education, a New York state group that opposes Common Core testing. Sure enough the flier read \"In 2014, Parents of 60,000 Students Refused NYS Common Core Tests.\"\nShe also referred us to Loy Gross, of Pavilion, N.Y., one of the parents involved in the anti-Common Core group.\nGross, the mother of two daughters, participated in an effort last year to count the number of students boycotting the tests statewide.\nGross, who now homeschools her children, told us that volunteers obtained figures from about half the state\u2019s 698 districts on the number of students opting out of each of the two tests -- one in math and the other in English.\nWe asked for the spreadsheet she used and samples of numbers from collectors. Gross never got back to us despite repeated phone calls and emails.\nWe also contacted the New York State \u00a0Education Department.\nA spreadsheet on the department\u2019s website showed that 1.136 million New York State students in grades three through eight \u00a0took the English language arts assessments and 1.08 million students took the math assessments in 2014.\nJeanne Beattie, a spokeswoman for the department, said approximately 49,000 students didn\u2019t take the English test for a \"known valid reason,\" such as a medically excused absence for illness or injury. About 67,000 students didn\u2019t test in math for the same reasons, she said.\nBut those aren\u2019t students who refused the tests. Beattie said the department doesn\u2019t \"directly collect test refusals.\" We also contacted the U.S. Department of Education, which also said it didn\u2019t collect such data.\n\n"}

That can be cut.\"\nWe wondered where that $16 billion figure came from, so we did some due diligence.\nWhen we contacted the Ossoff campaign, they sent us to a report published every year since 2011 by the Government Accountability Office, the respected, nonpartisan, investigative arm of Congress. The report, which is mandated by law, is designed to point out programs, offices and practices in government that could be eliminated or changed because they duplicate other government functions or fail to provide value for the taxpayer.\nOssoff\u2019s campaign said the $16 billion figure came from several line items in the GAO report that the candidate has reviewed and believes can be eliminated in short order and without significant harm.

Also, the $16 billion figure doesn\u2019t include all recommendations in the GAO report -- or even all of those that stem specifically from programs or efforts that GAO deemed duplicative.\nWe found at least two recommendations from the report that suggested savings from duplicative programs:\n\n"}

{"label": "false", "claim": "Sameh Shoukry In the past 20 years, Egypt has made \"great strides\" in political and democratic reform.", "evidence": "Egyptians took to the streets over the weekend to protest the authoritarian rule of President Hosni Mubarak and urge him to step down. The Egyptian ambassador to the United States, Sameh Shoukry, appeared on This Week with Christiane Amanpour to discuss the situation.\n\nAmanpour, reporting from Cairo, asked the ambassador how long Mubarak would \"continue to tolerate this number of people in the streets?\"\n\nShoukry replied, \"From the outset, the freedom of expression had been guaranteed. Egypt has been on a road of economic, political, democratic reform for the last 20 years or more, and it has achieved great strides in that regard. Freedom of expression, freedom of the press had been evolving and advancing with very important strides. I believe, in the president's speech, he indicated that there would be a guarantee of the freedom and ability of all Egyptians to express their points of view in a peaceful manner.\"\n\nThat didn't answer Amanpour's question, but we were interested in his statement that the country has made \"great strides\" in political and democratic reforms.\n\nThat was at odds with reporting we've read, so we decided to dig deeper to see if perhaps the ambassador was correct that Egypt has indeed been moving strongly toward more human rights over the past 20 years.\n\nWe found that numerous human rights organizations have given Egypt low marks for political openness and press freedom. We did find a few examples of improvement, particularly among the press and bloggers. But organizations described these positive developments as limited and at times occurring in spite of the government, not because of embraced reforms.\n\nThe international press freedom group Reporters Without Borders, for example, ranked Egypt as 127th out of 178 countries for press freedom in 2010. \"Since taking power in 1981, Hosni Mubarak has gone all out to curb not just press freedom but also citizens' rights to freedom of information. The authorities have for several years been tightening control over the Internet, but without excessive use of filtering,\" the group reported.\n\nFreedom House, a nonprofit that monitors democratic freedoms around the world, noted that \"Restrictions on press freedom continued in 2009, as Egyptian reporters tested the boundaries of acceptable coverage but were confronted by arrests, lawsuits and state-sponsored assaults.\"\n\n\"The Egyptian blogosphere remains extremely lively, with a large range of opinions freely expressed online and a wide breadth of content available to users of the medium. In response, the government has continued to harass and intimidate those who publish online,\" the report added.\n\nIn 2009, the Committee to Protect Journalists listed Egypt as one of the 10 worst countries for bloggers. \"Authorities regularly detain critical bloggers for open-ended periods. Local press freedom groups documented the detention of more than 100 bloggers in 2008 alone,\" the committee said in its release.\n\nHuman Rights Watch noted widespread instances of police brutality in a 2011 report. \"Police and security forces regularly engaged in torture in police stations, detention centers, and at points of arrest,\" the report said. There also were restrictions on freedom of religion. \"Although Egypt's constitution provides for equal rights without regard to religion, there is widespread discrimination against Egyptian Christians, as well as official intolerance of heterodox Muslim sects,\" the report said.\n\nDiplomatic cables released by Wikileaks show that U.S. State Department officials were equally down on Egypt's human rights record.\n\n\"Police brutality in Egypt against common criminals is routine and pervasive,\" said a\u00a02009 report from the U.S. embassy in Cairo. \"Contacts describe the police using force to extract confessions from criminals as a daily event, resulting from poor training and understaffing.\"\n\nA cable from 2008 reported, \"Our fundamental political reform goal in Egypt remains democratic transformation, including the expansion of political freedom and pluralism, respect for human rights, and a stable and legitimate transition to the post-Mubarak era. Egyptian democracy and human rights efforts, however, are being suffocated ...Mubarak now makes scant public pretense of advancing a vision for democratic change. An ongoing challenge remains balancing our security interests with our democracy promotion efforts.\"\n\nExperts we spoke with had similar comments.\n\nPeter Bouckaert, Human Rights Watch's emergencies director, told us he saw the ambassador's comments on This Week and thought they were \"deeply misleading and inaccurate.\"\n\n\"The level of human rights abuses and restrictions on political space have not significantly changed over the past decades, and this stagnation and the daily humiliations that come with it are at the very core of the popular revolt we are seeing today,\" Bouckaert said via e-mail. \"There are two separate realities in Egypt. That seen by the tourists and the ruling elite and that experienced by ordinary Egyptians. The ambassador was doubtlessly hoping that his audience was only familiar with the former.\"\n\nWe got a concise but telling reply from Steven Cook, a fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"He's a 'bs-er.' You can quote me,\" Cook said via e-mail.\n\nMichael Collins Dunn, editor of The Middle East Journal, said political freedoms might be a little better than they were 20 years ago, particularly in regard to press freedom. But looking at the government, political opposition remains weak, and Mubarak's ruling party has firm control of the government. \"If you're talking about genuine progress to a multiparty democracy, you have to look long and hard,\" Dunn said.\n\nFinally, we should note that Amanpour told the ambassador that the Egyptians protesting in the street didn't seem to agree with his statements. \"As I say, they are saying that what's happening is not enough,\" she said. \"What more should the government do to bring more freedom, political pluralism? There is no meaningful political space here.\"\n\nIn our ruling, we find little to support the ambassador's statement that \"Egypt has been on a road of economic, political, democratic reform for the last 20 years or more, and it has achieved great strides in that regard.\" A few things may have improved, particularly in the area of press freedom, but they are hardly \"great strides.\" In fact, the government continues to arrest journalists, police brutality is widespread, and the ruling party maintains firm control"}

The decades have done little to ease those concerns. In 2013, the Government Accountability Office reported that in the year before, oil and gas companies took in revenues of $66 billion and paid $10 billion to the government. Onshore leases in particular have not kept pace with the times, according to the GAO.\nThe conservation group Center for Western Priorities took up this banner with an intriguing comparison on its website.\n\"Oil companies can obtain an acre of public land for less than the price of a Big Mac,\" the center wrote.\nThe going price for a Big Mac, without the fries and the drink, is $3.99. We decided to check whether you can lease an acre of federal land for less than that.\nGreg Zimmerman, the policy director at the Center for Western Priorities, sent us a link to a September 2014 sales report from the Nevada office of the Bureau of Land Management. The numbers back up Zimmerman\u2019s claim.\nTexas-based Appaloosa Energy paid $6,426 for the rights to drill on 3,212 acres. Buena Vista Holdings out of Colorado paid $11,392 for the rights to 5,693 acres.\nThat comes out to $2 per acre, and even the mathematically challenged can see that is about half the price of a Big Mac. Under BLM regulations, $2 per acre is the minimum possible bid.\nJust to be clear, the company pays this money each year for the right to pump oil or gas from the land over a 10-year period. It doesn\u2019t actually own the land, but it has locked down the oil and gas rights.\nZimmerman acknowledges that there is another wrinkle here. There\u2019s an additional $1.50 per acre fee for the first five years. Zimmerman described it as the cost to hold the land while the company assesses what to do with it. A BLM spokesman told PunditFact that the bidder would pay $1.50 per year for the first five years and then $2.00 a year for the next five.\n\"Nevertheless, even if you add the $1.50 per acre rent to the $2.00 per acre bid, it would still be less than a Big Mac,\" Zimmerman said.\nIf the land ever starts producing oil or gas, the company starts paying royalties to the government on top of the $2 per acre leasing fee.\nIt\u2019s important to note that the statement simply said oil companies can obtain an acre for very little money. It doesn\u2019t say this happens a lot. When we ran the numbers for all of 2014, we found that the average price per acre nationwide was $220. That was for parcels leased through a competitive auction. If a parcel finds no takers through competitive bidding, the government can offer it non-competitively.\n\n"}

Eisenhower\u2019s\u00a0Atoms for Peace program funneled billions of dollars into nuclear\u00a0energy\u00a0development.\u00a0\nBefore the turn of the century, fossil fuel industries\u00a0accounted for up to 70% of the total cost of energy tax\u00a0breaks.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t until around 2008 that renewable energy sources became the primary benefactor of federal support.\n\"Where once the government targeted energy production generally,\u00a0it has shifted its spending focus towards cleaner, lower-carbon sources,\" Energy Institute researchers wrote.\nGenerally, subsidies\u00a0are defined as\u00a0direct payments\u00a0from the government\u00a0to energy producers\u00a0and\u00a0measures like\u00a0tax abatements.\u00a0\nThe most popular subsidy program from which wind energy producers benefit is the production tax credit, which was initially introduced in the Energy Policy Act of 1992.\u00a0Production tax credits reduce a wind producer\u2019s tax burden by\u00a0a certain amount\u00a0for every megawatt-hour of energy produced. In 2016, compensation was set at $23 per megawatt hour, although that amount ratchets down over a 10-year period.\u00a0\u00a0\nWind energy producers also benefited\u00a0from another federal program\u00a0that reimbursed developers 30% of their capital costs in lieu of a tax credit.\u00a0Known as Section 1603 cash grants, the program was introduced in 2009\u00a0and distributed $25.7 billion to\u00a0green energy\u00a0projects before it expired\u00a0three years later.\nBetween 2010 and 2013, Energy Institute researchers found that\u00a0federal\u00a0wind energy subsidies jumped from $5.4 billion to $5.7 billion\u00a0annually\u00a0thanks\u00a0to the Section 1603 grants. Following\u00a0the program's expiration, however, federal wind subsidies dropped to $2.7 billion in 2016\u00a0then were projected to climb back up to $4.6 billion by 2019.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, hydrocarbon-based energy producers, mostly including natural gas, also\u00a0have\u00a0enjoyed their share of\u00a0federal\u00a0subsidies\u00a0\u2014 from $3.1 billion in 2010 to a projected $6.2 billion in 2019, mostly through production tax abatements.\u00a0Subsidies for nuclear sources over the last decade have remained relatively steady at around $1.3 billion\u00a0annually.\n\n"}

It's the No. 1 abuser of this country,\" Trump said. \"And if you look at the way they take advantage, it's through currency manipulation. It's not even discussed in the almost 6,000-page agreement.\"\nThere\u2019s just one problem with Trump\u2019s rant on China, as Sen. Rand Paul emphatically pointed out at the debate: China isn\u2019t actually a part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nTo give Trump the benefit of the doubt, we asked some experts if there is any way China could benefit \"through the back door\" from the TPP. The short answer: no.\nAn overview of the TPP\nWhile you could read the entire trade deal in full, as Trump correctly points out, it\u2019s more than 6,000 pages long. Here\u2019s a quick summary, and you can check out a more detailed guide on Vox:\n\n\nThe TPP involves 12 countries: the United States, Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam and Brunei Darussalam.\n\n\nThe deal is meant to reduce trade barriers between these countries by lowering tariffs on goods, coordinating regulations and more.\n\n\nThe deal could also \"provide stronger legal protections to drug companies, lengthen the term of copyright protection, give foreign investors a new way to challenge countries' laws and regulations, and much more,\" according to Vox.\n\n\nIn June, Congress authorized \"fast-track\" authority for President Obama, meaning Congress will promptly approve or disapprove the agreement Obama has negotiated -- there will be no amendments or filibusters. A vote is expected in 2016.\n\n\nThe deal was negotiated in secret before being released to the public.\n\n\nAgain, we should make it clear: China was in no way involved in TPP negotiations.\nCan China somehow benefit?\nWe asked experts if there was any way China could possibly take advantage of the TPP. The experts all agreed: The trade deal will most likely negatively impact China.\nJoel P. Trachtman, an international law professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, said the deal \"would mean there would be zero tariffs on goods coming to the United States from places that compete with China.\"\n\n\"It certainly wouldn\u2019t be expected to help China,\" he said.\n\n"}

Unemployment is at its lowest level in 16 years, and because of our regulatory and other reforms, we have more people working in the United States today than ever before. Companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time.\"\nWe decided to check his assertion that \"companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time.\"\nWe found that Trump exaggerated the job growth (it's not unprecedented), but there is some truth to his point about companies moving back to the country.\nOverall job growth\nThe most obvious way to look at this claim is to look at recent job growth rates. So we looked up month-to-month increases in jobs since 2011 -- the point at which the national economy started gaining jobs consistently after the Great Recession.\n\nThe monthly gains in red -- those since Trump became president -- don\u2019t look much different from the types of gains seen under President Barack Obama starting in 2011. The highest monthly job gain under Trump -- 232,000 -- was exceeded in 28 separate months on Obama\u2019s watch.\nNext, we looked at the specific job gains under Trump from February 2017 to August 2017. We compared that period to the February-to-August job gains under Obama between 2011 and 2016. Here\u2019s what we found:\n\nThis chart shows that the job gains under Trump were actually lower than each of the last six years of February-to-August job gains for Obama, except for one year -- 2012.\nThis shouldn\u2019t suggest that the pace of job creation this year is a disappointment. While one would expect big job gains in the immediate aftermath of a major recession as the economy catches up, seeing substantial gains this many years after the recession officially ended is far from guaranteed.\nIn reality, August 2017 represented the 83rd successive month of month-to-month job gains -- easily a record. The longest previous spell of positive increases in monthly payroll employment was 48, in the period ending in June 1990, said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\"It is surprising how long (strong job growth) has continued,\" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist.\nAt the same time, she added, \"it's also disappointing that the gain in jobs hasn't also been accompanied by strong wages and productivity growth.\"\nLooking at 'reshored' jobs\nAnother way of looking a Trump\u2019s statement is not in terms of record overall job growth, but specifically about jobs created by companies moving their operations to the United States.\nHere, he has a stronger point.\n\n"}

The answer isn\u2019t so clear.\nWhat\u2019s at stake?\nSo what would Nevada\u2019s proposed background check expansion actually mean for gun owners?\nIf approved by voters, the initiative would create an escalating penalty (starting with a misdemeanor) for people without a license to sell firearms to sell or transfer guns without first going to a licensed dealer and having them conduct a background check.\nThat would be a departure from current state law, where background checks are generally not required for gun sales or transfers between two private parties (lawmakers approved a change waiving fees for voluntary background checks in 2015).\nRepublican Gov. Brian Sandoval vetoed a bill in 2013 that would have enacted a similar background check process on private gun sales and transfers, saying it would impose \"unreasonable burdens and harsh penalties\" on otherwise law-abiding gun owners.\nIf approved, licensed firearm dealers would be required to conduct the background checks, which is done under the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and is generally completed fairly quickly (though delays can last up to three days).\nThere are some exceptions built in to the ballot question, including sales and transfers between family members and for antique guns. Temporary transfers without background checks would be allowed in some specific cases, like on certified shooting ranges, in areas where it\u2019s legal to hunt or while in the presence of the gun owner.\nDebate over the ballot measure echoes the national debate over gun control. Supporters say the majority of background checks are completed quickly and the measure closes an existing loophole, while opponents lambast the measure for being overly vague and unduly burdensome on gun owners.\nTransfers and Exemptions\nApproval of Question 1 would turn private party gun sales and transfers in Nevada into a process that would more closely resemble California\u2019s existing system, but there are some differences that would persist between the two states especially in the area of temporary gun transfers, or loans.\nUithoven told PolitiFact that California generally allows people \"who are personally known to each other\" to infrequently loan firearms for up to 30 days as long as the recipient has a valid firearm safety certificate and the loan is for a \"lawful purpose.\"\n\n"}

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Danny Tarkanian Nevada Republicans \"didn\u2019t do one single thing to cut spending\" in 2015.", "evidence": "House Majority Leader Eric Cantor rarely passes an opportunity to brand President Barack Obama as a reckless spender.\n\nDuring a March 17 interview\u00a0on Fox News, the Virginia Republican said Obama \"missed the opportunity\" to cut spending in the 2012 federal budget he sent to Congress this winter.\n\nCantor complained Obama\u2019s proposal would merely freeze discretionary spending. \"That\u2019s after it\u2019s increased by over 20-some percent over the last two years if you don\u2019t include the stimulus,\" he told host Greta Van Susteren. \"If you put the stimulus in, it\u2019s over 80 percent.\"\n\nWe checked his numbers.\n\nFirst, an explanation: Discretionary spending is the money Congress controls through annual appropriations. It goes for services such as defense, education, health and housing. In contrast, mandatory spending is used for entitlement programs with required levels of funding -- Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nRay Allen, a political adviser to Cantor, said the congressman was referring to non-defense discretionary spending. He also said Cantor, in discussing spending \"over the last two years\" is referring to a period that begins with Obama\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2009.\n\nPolitiFact is no stranger to the set of numbers Cantor used. They also have been cited by Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., chairman of the House Budget Committee. The figures, culled from the Congressional Budget Office, can be traced to a Ryan news release last June.\n\nAlthough several budget experts we spoke to quibbled about the exact figures Cantor used, the raw numbers are not really in dispute. His computations of those numbers, however, have problems.\n\nThe numbers show non-defense discretionary spending rose from $434 billion in fiscal 2008 to $537 billion in fiscal 2010. That\u2019s a 23.7 percent jump -- consistent with the \"20-some percent\" increase Cantor claimed.\n\nCantor does not provide an historical perspective to those numbers, so we will. In the eight federal budgets approved during Republican George W. Bush\u2019s administration -- non-defense discretionary spending increased by an average 9.6 percent each year. During the first two years of the Obama administration, it has grown by an annual average of 11.9 percent.\n\nNon-defense discretionary spending adds up to about one-sixth of expenditures in the federal budget. Even if it was completely eliminated, the nation would still run an estimated $820 billion deficit this fiscal year, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nNow, let\u2019s move to the $787 billion stimulus package, approved by the Democratic-controlled Congress in 2009 with hopes that a federal injection of money would jolt the economy out of recession. \u00a0A third of the money -- $259 billion -- was appropriated for discretionary uses.\n\nCantor adds all of the $259 billion to the $537 billion in discretionary spending for 2010.\n\nThat gives him a total of $796 billion in discretionary spending for fiscal 2010. And if you compare it to the $434 billion in 2008, it\u2019s an 83.4 percent increase -- consistent with the \"over 80 percent\" he claimed.\n\nBut there are a few catches.\n\nFirst, not everyone agrees it\u2019s appropriate to include stimulus money in the calculation since it could be considered one-time emergency spending -- not part of the budget base. Cantor seemed to acknowledge that point by saying, \"If you put the stimulus in, it\u2019s over 80 percent.\"\n\nWe also wondered why Cantor counted the $257 billion in 2010. After all, the stimulus was approved in 2009.\n\nAllen said Cantor lumped the stimulus money into fiscal 2010 because that\u2019s the year most of it was spent. \"When something passed is irrelevant,\" Allen said. \"What matters is when it\u2019s spent.\"\n\nSeveral budget experts said Allen\u2019s point is valid. So we went back to the spread sheets and encountered a problem: We found no one, including Cantor, who could produce data showing the exact yearly expenditures\u00a0of non-discretionary stimulus funds.\n\nBut we did find two tables that suggest Cantor\u2019s contention that all of the money was spent in 2010 is faulty. A 2009 analysis of the stimulus bill by the Congressional Budget Office said the discretionary money would be doled out over a number of years, with 36 percent being spent in 2010.\n\nThe CBO published an updated estimate of stimulus spending in January. It indicates that about 34 percent of the \"budgetary effects\" of the discretionary portion came in 2010. To assume that obligated money has been spent is incorrect.\n\nSo let\u2019s suppose 35 percent is the actual figure. That would mean\u00a0Cantor, under his formula, should have applied only $90 billion of stimulus to last year\u2019s discretionary spending total -- not the full $257 billion.\n\nIt would mean discretionary spending, if you include the stimulus, increased 44 percent during the first two years of the Obama administration -- far shy of the \"over 80 percent\" Cantor claimed.\n\nAllen disputed our calculus, saying only a tiny portion remained unspent at the end of 2010. He referred to CBO documents from earlier this year saying all but about $5 billion in discretionary stimulus money has been \"obligated.\"\n\nThe CBO defines obligations as \"a legally binding commitment by the federal government that will result in outlays, immediately or in the future.\"\n\nContrary to the claim of Cantor\u2019s camp, the CBO documents do not prove most of the money was spent in 2010. One of the reports, in fact, says \"most of the discretionary funding provided by ARRA (the stimulus) has been obligated, although outlays may occur in 2011 and later years.\"\n\nLet\u2019s review:\n\nCantor said discretionary spending has \"increased over 20-some percent in two years if you don\u2019t include the stimulus. If you put in the stimulus, it\u2019s over 80 percent.\"\n\nWithout the stimulus, discretionary spending increased 23.7 percent. So is Cantor right on that part.\n\nBut the majority leader runs into trouble when he starts counting discretionary stimulus funds.\n\n"}

One of the most contested components is $140 million for the \"schools of hope\" program, largely to attract privately managed charter schools to compete with near-failing schools in poor neighborhoods.\nGiven the heated debate on school funding, we wondered whether the 2017-18 state budget really contained \"the greatest investment in education in Florida history,\" or if there\u2019s more to the balance sheet we should consider.\nA marginal increase in base funding\nAs a quick overview, the most common measure of education spending is the Florida Education Finance Program (FEFP), the main source of dollars for K-12 education. When most people discuss K-12 school funding, this is what they are talking about.\nBy law, it\u2019s a combination of state and local funding. Each school district must contribute property tax dollars, called the \"required local effort,\" in an amount dictated by the state. In recent years, the state has also received federal stimulus dollars.\nFor 2017-18, the Legislature increased the base education budget, or FEFP, from about $20.2 billion to $20.4 billion.\nIn the current school year, spending is about $7,196 per pupil. The 2017-18 budget raises that to about $7,221 per student, a 0.34 percent increase. The small change has drawn jeers from educators and parents, and is $200 less than the $7,421 amount Gov. Rick Scott requested in his proposed budget.\nCorcoran is talking about more than the FEFP to reach his total.\nGetting to $24 billion\nHis $24 billion figure includes several allocations for multiple programs outside the FEFP, and technically is the total for voluntary pre-kindergarten, as well as other programs including mentoring services and grants.\nWe requested analyses from both the House and Senate on both sides of the aisle, and they came up with roughly the same figures: The entire education budget for the next fiscal year \u2014 including the FEFP, grants, special programs and more \u2014 is about $14.7 billion in state funds (including $3.2 billion from state trust funds), plus another $9 billion from the required local effort. That\u2019s a total of $23.7 billion, give or take a few estimated millions.\nWhen you add HB 7069\u2019s $419 million to that, you get about $24 billion.\nCorcoran spokesman Fred Piccolo said that $24 billion outstripped all education funding from prior years, topping the current fiscal year\u2019s $23.4 billion. He sent us a list of 10 years\u2019 worth of spending, but would not specify what programs his office was counting when they compiled the figures.\nBut that\u2019s okay, because we don\u2019t need to look at every program. Even with its tiny increase for next year, the FEFP is slated to be the highest it\u2019s ever been. It\u2019s been on the rise the last few years, after Scott cut education spending when he took office after the 2008 recession.\n\n\n\n\nFiscal year\n\n\nTotal K-12 budget\n\n\nPer-pupil spending\n\n\nK-12 enrollment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2007-08\n\n\n$18.7 billion\n\n\n$7,126\n\n\n2.63 million\n\n\n\n\n2008-09\n\n\n$17.9 billion\n\n\n$6,846\n\n\n2.62 million\n\n\n\n\n2009-10*\n\n\n$18 billion\n\n\n$6,846\n\n\n2.63 million\n\n\n\n\n2010-11*\n\n\n$18.2 billion\n\n\n$6,897\n\n"}

His overall point is misleading and, in the words of one expert, \"completely nonsensical.\" \u00a0\u00a0\nBombs and black gold\nWe\u2019ll start with an overview of ISIS\u2019 oil assets and what\u2019s been bombed.\nISIS has hijacked the bulk of Syria\u2019s oil, which has become a major cash cow for the terrorist group\u2019s operations. (Other prominent sources of revenue include taxation and extortion, sales of looted property, bank robberies, kidnapping ransoms and state-run businesses.)\nWith about a half-dozen oil fields under its control, ISIS churns out an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 barrels per day and makes $1.5 million to $2 million daily from oil sales.\nU.S. and coalition military forces have been trying to get at this revenue source by periodically targeting oil assets for over a year. From the start of the operation against ISIS in August 2014 to Nov. 13, 2015, airstrikes have damaged or destroyed 260 oil infrastructure targets, according to the Defense Department. \u00a0\nThese strikes were initially aimed at easy targets like mobile refineries and storage depots, and not entirely successful, a Pentagon official admitted. So attacks were ramped up to focus on more sensitive targets like tanker trucks and wellheads.\nIn October 2015, the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS launched a second campaign specifically aimed to cut two-thirds of the terrorists\u2019 oil revenue. By Dec. 1, military forces had destroyed wells, processing facilities and nearly 400 ISIS oil trucks, according to Defense Secretary Ash Carter.\n\"We've seen the U.S. get a lot more creative and aggressive with its target list,\" said Matthew Reed, vice president of Foreign Reports, a Washington-based consultant firm specializing in Middle East oil politics. \"It has had to overcome a learning curve. It's still learning what to hit and where.\"\nMisquoting Morell?\nDid a top CIA official admit that these attacks were limited because of climate change concerns? The Cruz campaign didn't get back to us. Our search of congressional transcripts did not turn up any instance\u00a0of Morell giving congressional testimony on this point.\nCruz could be thinking of comments by Morell on PBS\u2019 Charlie Rose on Nov. 23. Here\u2019s what Morell said:\nMorell: \"So prior to Paris, there seemed to be a judgment \u2014 I don\u2019t sit in the Sit. Room (sic) anymore \u2014 but there seemed to have been a judgment that, look, we don't want to destroy these oil tankers because that's\u00a0infrastructure that's going to be necessary to support the people when ISIS isn't there anymore.\n\"And it's going to create environmental damage. And we didn't go after oil wells \u2014 actually hitting oil wells that ISIS controls because we didn't want to do environmental damage and we didn\u2019t want to destroy that infrastructure.\"\nRose: \"So we\u2019re hitting oil on trucks.\"\n\n"}

Rick Scott, whose tea party base has been among the most vocal critics, called for three public hearings in October to garner input. Education officials have said that the comments could be used to \"tweak\" the standards, which already are being used in the state\u2019s schools.\nEducation Commissioner Pam Stewart listened during the first hearing on Oct. 15 in Tampa as dozens of people spoke. The first speaker was Sandra Stotsky, an education professor at the University of Arkansas and staunch critic of the Common Core.\nOne of Stotsky\u2019s complaints was that literature and fiction would be replaced with nonfiction informational texts.\n\"Common Core expects English teachers to spend at least half of their reading instructional time at every grade level on informational texts \u2014 a percentage from which students cannot benefit intellectually,\" she said\nWe decided to check the part of her statement about what kind of texts English teachers will be required to use in their classes.\nThere\u2019s plenty of evidence that the Common Core standards emphasize informational texts. The introduction says, \"The standards are not alone in calling for a special emphasis on informational text.\" The Common Core also states that it follows the lead of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) in \"balancing the reading of literature with the reading of informational texts, including texts in history/social studies, science, and technical subjects.\"\nCommon Core follows a NAEP framework that spells out percentages of literary versus informational texts by grade level. It calls for a 50 percent/50 percent split in grade four, with an increasing emphasis on informational texts in later grades. In grade eight, there\u2019s a 45 percent/55 percent split, while in grade 12, the split is 30 percent/70 percent.\nSome news stories suggest that English teachers are using more informational texts in their classrooms as they move to the Common Core. An Oct. 15 story in The Hechinger Report found that some English teachers in Florida have replaced some classic works of literature with nonfiction books or added informational texts to their instruction. One teacher replaced the novel The Great Gatsby, with a memoir, The Glass Castle. Another said she would assign students Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s \"I Have a Dream\" speech alongside the novel To Kill a Mockingbird.\nIn a piece for The Heritage Foundation last year, Stotsky pointed to such stories as evidence that the Common Core is damaging the English curriculum.\n\"Anecdotal reports from high school English teachers indicate that the amount of informational or nonfiction reading they are being told to do in their classroom is 50 percent or more of their reading instructional time\u2014and that they will have time only for excerpts from novels, plays, or epic poems if they want students to read more than very short stories and poems,\" she wrote.\nStotsky said her remarks were based on the number of reading standards in Common Core. There are 10 standards for informational text and nine for literature in every grade level. \"That is approximately 50/50,\" she wrote in an email sent after publication. \"Many departments of education and superintendents have told local school districts to spend 50 percent of their reading time on 'informational texts' and 50 percent on literary study.

His spokeswoman, Andrea Pivarunas, sent us sources for the numbers.\nThe EPA had a staff of 8,358 in 1972 and it grew to 17,359 in 2011, according to data from the agency. That\u2019s an increase of 107.7 percent -- matching what Griffith said.\nWe should note that EPA dropped to 15,913 employees last year as many cashed in on an early retirement incentive offered to federal workers. So if Griffith had used the the most current data available, the increase since 1972 would have translated to 90.4 percent.\nThe total number of federal employees was 5.2 million in 1972 and 4.4 million in 2011, according to the federal Office of Personnel Management. That\u2019s a decrease of 15.4 percent -- again, what Griffith said.\nThe federal workforce figure requires elaboration because it includes civilians and uniformed military personnel, which have experienced different trends since 1972.\nExecutive branch civilian employees numbered 2.82 million in 1972 and 2.76 million in 2011, a drop of 2.1 percent. Meanwhile, uniformed military personnel numbered 2.36 million in 1972 and 1.58 million in 2011, a decrease of 33.1 percent. So the reduction in federal employees has more to do with a smaller fighting force than with a shrinking bureaucracy.\nNow, let\u2019s return to the EPA. What accounted for its sharp rise in employment? The answer is that the agency was barely out of infancy in 1972 when Griffith begins his timeline. \u00a0\nThe EPA was created on Dec. 2, 1970, to consolidate environmental quality programs in several federal departments. For example, the Interior Department worked on water quality and pesticides, while the Department of Health, Education and Welfare worked on air pollution, and the Food and Drug Administration conducted pesticides research. In areas where the federal government didn\u2019t have oversight, state or local governments were left to fill in the gaps.\nCongress passed a number of laws in the 1970s that expanded the EPA\u2019s authority: \u00a0\n\n\nClean Air Act to set national air quality, automobile emission and anti-pollution standards\n\n"}

{"label": "pants-fire", "claim": "Scott Brown The stimulus bill \"didn\u2019t create one new job.\"", "evidence": "A major theme in Republican complaints about the $862 billion stimulus program is that it didn't deliver enough jobs. Republican Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts took that view to an extreme, claiming that it didn't create any new jobs. Here's what he said during a Feb. 4, 2010, news conference, shortly after he was sworn in.\u201cThe last stimulus bill didn\u2019t create one new job, and in some states the money that was actually released hasn\u2019t even been used yet,\u201d Brown said.ABC's Jonathan Karl immediately followed up. \u201cIt didn\u2019t create one new job?\u201d Karl asked.\u201cThat\u2019s correct. We lost another 85,000 jobs again, give or take, last month,\u201d Brown responded.\u00a0 \u201cAnd in Massachusetts, it hasn\u2019t created one new job and throughout the country as well. It may have retained some, but it hasn\u2019t created any new jobs.\"There are two ways to analyze this question -- looking at jobs created directly by the stimulus, and looking at jobs created in the broader economy since the stimulus bill took effect.We'll look first at jobs funded directly by the stimulus.According to Recovery.gov -- the Obama administration's Web site that tracks the stimulus effort -- the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act created or saved 634,042 jobs between Feb. 17, 2009, and Sept. 30, 2009, and it funded 595,263 jobs between Oct. 1, 2009, and Dec. 31, 2009. The data come from reports filed by the primary recipient of stimulus funds such as state and local governments and private-sector companies.These numbers aren't perfect. They meld bits and pieces of part-time jobs into \"full-time equivalent\" jobs, and the two periods use different criteria for job counting, due to a change dictated by the Office of Management and Budget in December 2009. (For the earlier of the two periods cited above, the number refers to jobs created or saved; for the later of the two periods, it refers to the number of jobs funded by the stimulus without reference to whether that funding created or saved a job.) Also, the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, concluded in November 2009 that \"there are a range of significant reporting and quality issues that need to be addressed\" in this reporting system.So these statistics may overstate the actual number of jobs created. But not by enough to make Brown's zero-jobs claim accurate.So there's strong evidence that the stimulus has created lots of jobs directly through federal spending. What about the economy as a whole?Economists have been estimating the impact of the stimulus on jobs by comparing two numbers: current employment statistics and an estimate of what those employment numbers would have looked like had there been no stimulus.In a report released on Jan. 13, 2010, the president's Council of Economic Advisers estimated that between 1.77 million jobs and 2.07 million jobs were created or saved by the stimulus through the fourth quarter of 2009.Separately, the council's report cited four independent analyses of the same question. These estimates were by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, as well by three private-sector economic-analysis firms. Here's what those groups found:\u2022 CBO: Between 800,000 jobs (low estimate) and 2.4 million jobs (high estimate) saved or created.\u2022 IHS/Global Insight: 1.25 million jobs saved or created.\u2022 Macroeconomic Advisers: 1.06 million jobs saved or created.\u2022 Moody's economy.com: 1.59 million jobs saved or created.A couple of caveats: These estimates are based on economic models that vary somewhat from study to study, and not everyone buys the idea that it's possible to measure how the economy would have fared in the absence of a stimulus.Indeed, some economists, including many conservatives, believe that the multiplier effect from the stimulus is small or nonexistent. \"Every dollar Congress injects into the economy must first be taxed or borrowed out of the economy,\" writes economist Brian Riedl of the conservative Heritage Foundation. \"No new purchasing power is created; it is merely transferred from one part of the economy to another. ... Removing water from one end of a swimming pool and pouring it in the other end will not raise the overall water level -- no matter how large the bucket. Similarly, borrowing money from one part of the economy and redistributing to another part of the economy will not create new growth -- no matter how big the stimulus bill.\"We acknowledge that there's some dispute on this question. Still, the independent estimates we've seen have credibility, and they all agree that at least 1 million jobs have been created or saved. That, in combination with the hundreds of thousands of jobs cited on recovery.gov as being funded directly by the stimulus, contradicts Brown's assertion that the bill \"didn\u2019t create one new job.\"But if Brown had chosen his words more carefully, he could have scored better on the Truth-O-Meter.He's right that the economy as a whole has been losing jobs almost every single month since January 2008. According to a chart prepared by the Obama White House, there has been positive job growth in only one month during that period -- November 2009. (In his news conference comment, Brown actually underestimated the net job losses in December 2009, which was the most recent month for which data was available before he spoke; it was about 150,000, rather than 85,000.)So if Brown had said that the national economy hasn't seen any net gain in jobs since the stimulus bill was passed, he would have earned himself a True.A spokesman for Brown, Eric Fehrnstrom, made that point to us in an interview. \"The fact is that we have lost jobs every month since the stimulus passed,\" Fehrnstrom said. \"No amount of political spin can change that fact.\"But that's not what Brown said. He said the stimulus bill \"didn\u2019t create one new job\" and, when asked to clarify, he said it \"hasn\u2019t created any new jobs.\" It's perfectly reasonable to question whether the $862 billion was well spent and whether it is good economic policy. But that money has clearly resulted in tens of thousands of jobs that wouldn't exist otherwise. It's preposterous to claim that no new jobs came out of it. We find his claim Pants on Fire!\n\n"}

Do Texans also oppose a wall?\nPolls show Texans divided on the wall\n\nCastro spokeswoman Jamie Geller said the congressman\u2019s claim was based on an April 2018 poll published by Quinnipiac University which reported that 53 percent of respondents surveyed opposed construction of a wall, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.\nWe decided to take a step back and consider polls released on this subject since 2016 from three non-partisan entities that run surveys in Texas to assess the validity of Castro\u2019s claim: University of Texas/Texas Tribune polls, Texas Lyceum polls and Quinnipiac University polls.\nFour polls showed more respondents opposing the wall than supporting it, with one poll showing the opposite. A sixth survey released Tuesday, after Castro made his claim on Texans opposing the wall, revealed an even split. Only two of the polls showed a clear majority in opposition to the wall.\n\nA University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll of registered voters in Texas published in June 2016 showed that 52 percent of respondents either strongly supported or somewhat supported a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\nThe same poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.83 percentage points, found 40 percent of respondents said they either strongly opposed or somewhat opposed a border wall. Of those polled, 8 percent said they did not know or had no opinion on the wall.\nTwo years later, in February 2018, a University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll showed that 50 percent of respondents said they either strongly opposed or somewhat opposed a border wall and 45 percent strongly supported or somewhat supported a wall.\nTwo polls from Texas Lyceum, a non-profit organization, showed majorities opposing the wall. These polls did not limit the pool of respondents to likely or registered voters and instead surveyed adults in Texas.\nA September 2016 poll from the group showed that 59 percent of adults polled opposed Trump\u2019s proposed border wall, with 35 percent supporting the wall. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\nAn April 2017 Texas Lyceum poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, reported 61 percent of respondents opposing the wall and 35 percent expressing support.\n\n"}

Coulter told host Tucker Carlson that she woke up Saturday morning to\u00a0an email from a friend who said her sister \"almost died because of Obamacare.\"\nCoulter zipped through the backstory:\nThe woman \"had been thrown off her insurance plan, you know Blue Shield completely just pulled out of California.\"\nThe woman tried to \"get on Obamacare, (but) couldn\u2019t get through the website.\" Then she got a fever, but she didn\u2019t want to go to the emergency room without insurance. On Thursday, the woman went into septic shock, Coulter said, and went to the hospital.\nCoulter recounted the story in a Saturday speech. \"I got up to my hotel room after the speech and my friend sent me an email saying, \u2018My sister died from Obamacare,\u2019 \" she said.\nCarlson responded, \"That is completely shocking.\"\nCoulter added that\u00a0she asked her friend if she could tweet the sister's story, and \"She said, 'Julie would be very happy for you to tweet this.' \"\nWe don't know the name of the woman (beyond Julie), the type of coverage she had\u00a0or anything about her medical history, and\u00a0Coulter did not respond to our request for more information. But the claim that someone\u00a0\"died from Obamacare\" because\u00a0Blue Shield \"completely just pulled out of California\" is something we can fact-check.\nIt\u2019s obviously misleading to say someone died from Obamacare in the same way someones dies from cancer or a car accident. Hospitals in the United States are required to treat patients whether they have health insurance or not.\nBut more germane to this particular fact-check is Coulter\u2019s assertion that the woman found herself without insurance because Blue Shield pulled out of the state of California.\nThat did not happen.\nBlue Shield of California: Still in business\nSome insurance companies stopped writing health insurance policies in the individual market in California, but not Blue Shield of California.\nThe not-for-profit insurer competes with for-profit insurer Anthem Blue Cross and Kaiser Permanente. It continues to be a big player in the individual marketplace, which is what we assume Coulter is talking about, as well as the state\u2019s health exchange, Covered California.\n\n"}

David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island and former mayor of Providence, has joined current mayors of cities around the country to fight a gun-permit bill pending in Congress.\n\nThe National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act (H.R. 822), sponsored by U.S. Rep. Clifford Stearns, R-Fla., would require all states to recognize out-of-state permits for carrying concealed weapons.\n\nThe House approved the bill 272 to 154 on Nov. 16, 2011. Cicilline and Rep. James Langevin, also a Democrat from Rhode Island, both voted against it. The bill is before the Senate Judiciary Committee. (A similar measure was narrowly defeated in the Senate in 2009.)\n\nFederal law restricts who can own or possess a firearm, and bans possession by anyone convicted of a felony. But the rules for getting a permit to carry a concealed weapon vary from state to state.\n\nNine states, including Rhode Island, don\u2019t recognize out-of-state gun permits, according to Mayors Against Illegal Guns.\n\nIn a Nov. 18 fundraising letter e-mailed to constituents, Cicilline attacked Republicans and \"Tea Partiers\" for supporting the Right-to-Carry bill. \u00a0\n\n\"Earlier this week, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives -- with the enthusiastic support of Sarah Palin, Texas Governor Rick Perry, and the Tea Partiers -- once again turned their backs on the 14 million unemployed Americans in our country,\" the letter says, \"and instead chose to focus their efforts on expanding the rights of sex offenders, terrorists, child predators, and abusers to carry concealed weapons across state lines.\"\n\nSex offenders? Terrorists? Child predators and abusers?\n\n\"I told you: you wouldn\u2019t believe it,\" the letter continues.\n\nActually, we weren\u2019t sure what to believe. So we decided to check it out.\n\nThe facts\n\nWe focused on the second part of the statement: \"expanding the rights of sex offenders, terrorists, child predators, and abusers to carry concealed weapons across state lines.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe phrase \"expanding the rights\u2019\u2019 suggests that these criminals currently have the right to carry concealed weapons. But do they?\n\nCicilline and his staff offered numerous examples, both hypothetical and real, to argue that, under the bill, criminals in each of the four categories could legally carry a concealed firearm into a state such as Rhode Island, which would amount to \"expanding their rights.\"\n\nWe checked what they offered and will summarize our findings, looking at the categories separately.\n\nDomestic abusers\n\nUnder federal law, anyone convicted of a crime of domestic violence, including misdemeanors, or anyone subject to a court restraining order cannot legally own or possess a firearm.\n\nCicilline\u2019s staff provided us with information from Mayors Against Illegal Guns about four cases (in Missouri, Idaho, Florida and Pennsylvania) in which domestic abusers were granted concealed weapon permits and went on to commit murder.\n\nIn three of the cases (those from Florida, Idaho and Missouri), authorities failed to enforce the federal law banning domestic abusers from possessing weapons, according to the summaries provided. In none of those cases did the abusers have the right to carry concealed weapons. So the Right-to-Carry Act can\u2019t expand a right they don\u2019t have.\n\nBut in the Pennsylvania case, our research confirmed that the killer was granted a concealed weapons permit, despite a prior restraining order for domestic abuse. There were nothing to prohibit the state from granting the permit because the restraining order had been withdrawn.\n\nSo in the domestic abuse category, one of the four examples that Cicilline\u2019s staff provided -- the Pennsylvania case -- supports his claim that some people with a record of domestic abuse can legally carry a concealed weapon.\n\nChild predators\n\nAdults who sexually prey on children are prohibited by federal law from owning or possessing firearms if they have been convicted of a felony.\n\nAnd sex crimes against children are almost always felonies.\n\nBut the term \"child predator,\" Cicilline\u2019s staff said in a follow-up e-mail, speaks more broadly about crimes that \"lead up to or are related to child molestation.\u2019\u2019\nmisdemeanor\nThey referred us to laws regarding sex-crimes against minors in states such as Florida, Georgia and New Hampshire, where there are no laws preventing such criminals from getting concealed weapon permits.\n\nWe believe that some of the examples Cicilline\u2019s staff provided, including a Georgia law that makes unwanted sexual touching of a 16-year-old a misdemeanor, stretch the meaning of the term \"child predator.\"\n\nBut in New Hampshire, an adult who lures a child into engaging in sex for pornography -- a misdemeanor in that state -- is clearly a child predator.\n\nSo that example met the test.\n\nSex offenders\n\nFederal law prohibits sex offenders convicted of felonies from owning or possessing firearms.\n\nBut Cicilline\u2019s staff noted that someone convicted of a misdemeanor sex offense involving another adult would not automatically be barred from getting a concealed weapon permit in some states.\n\nIn New Hampshire, for example, it\u2019s a misdemeanor for correctional officers to engage in sex with someone over whom they have authority.\n\nAnn Rice, a New Hampshire deputy attorney general, said conviction for such a crime would not automatically bar someone from getting a concealed weapon permit.\n\nIn this category, we verified that the type of case cited by Cicilline\u2019s staff supports his statement.\n\nTerrorists\n\nFederal law bars anyone arrested, charged or convicted of acts of terrorism from owning or possessing a firearm. The Right-to-Carry bill clearly would not expand their rights.\n\nBut Cicilline and his staff offered a broader definition of \"terrorist\" to support the congressman\u2019s claim.\n\nThey said people convicted under \u00a0state terrorism laws, adopted in several cases after the Sept. 11 attacks, and people on the federal government\u2019s terrorist watchlist could be considered \"terrorists\" or \"suspected terrorists.\"\n\n"}

According to the FDA, its primary component is elemental mercury. Amalgam fillings are also known as \"silver fillings\" because of their silver-like appearance. The agency says such fillings have been used in hundreds of millions of patients around the world for over a century, and are beneficial because they\u2019re strong and less likely to break than those made of other materials.\nBut there are also risks. Amalgam releases low levels of mercury vapor that can be inhaled and absorbed by the lungs.\u00a0\nHigh levels of mercury vapor exposure can harm the brain and kidneys. The FDA says it reviewed scientific evidence to determine whether low levels of mercury vapor from dental amalgam fillings were cause for concern. Based on the evidence, according to the agency, the FDA considers them safe for adults and children 6 and older.\u00a0\nBut fetuses and young children may be more sensitive to the \"neurotoxic effects of mercury vapor,\" according to the FDA.

The group sought to ban mercury fillings from the U.S. market. As part of the settlement, according to Reuters, the FDA agreed to alert consumers about the potential risks on its website and to issue a more specific rule about fillings that contain mercury.\n\n"}

When the federal rules for children\u2019s games changed to include those 14 and older, the company entered into a May 2010 voluntary recall of all the toys with the original labeling. It went on to create a \"comprehensive safety program\" and began labeling the toys with a warning: \"Keep Away From All Children.\"\n\nThe company also required retailers to agree to rules for placement of its products in their stores, with new signs. It designed a \"Magnet Safety\" website in March and met with three CPSC commissioners and staff in April to discuss the expanded safety program. The company also created a medical advisory group and, along with its competitors, created the Coalition for Magnet Safety.\n\nBut on July 10, the commission voted 3-1 to file the administrative complaint after, it said, \"discussions with the company and its representatives failed to result in a voluntary recall plan that CPSC considered to be adequate.\" The CPSC said that, despite the warnings and labeling, people were still ingesting the magnets, sometimes after placing them on tongues or on cheeks to resemble piercings.\n\nThe CPSC warned that when two magnets are swallowed, they can be attracted to each other through stomach or intestinal walls, resulting in serious injury requiring surgery. CPSC spokesman Scott Wolfson said in an interview that gastroenterologists have said the injuries often resemble \"a gunshot to the gut\" but without entrance or exit wounds. Wolfson noted that both Maxfield & Oberton and a Denver-based company, Zen Magnets, were sued after they failed to provide adequate suggestions for making their products safer. They were the first such complaints since the Arkansas-based Daisy BB gun company was sued in 2001.\n\n\"Due to the number of ingestion incidents received by CPSC staff since the 2010 recall announcement and 2011 safety alert, CPSC staff seeks the remedies outlined in the complaint to stop further incidents and injuries to children,\" the agency said in a statement. Those remedies include stopping the sale of the toys and providing consumers with refunds.\n\nOur ruling\n\nBlackburn, Roe and their fellow letter writers are concerned that the \"nation\u2019s brightest innovators and job creators\" are being penalized by an overzealous consumer protection agency. We\u2019ll leave it to others to determine whether the sellers of Chinese magnetic balls qualify as the nation\u2019s \"brightest innovators,\" and will also decline to determine the truth of the letter writers\u2019 assertion that the agency\u2019s first administrative complaint in 11 years suggest \"excessive and selective enforcement.\"\n\nThose are opinions, but it is possible to see whether the CPSC failed to consult or seek input from the company.\n\nThe lengthy record laid out by the company\u2019s CEO establishes there was, in fact, much consultation leading up the agency\u2019s conclusion that the toys are inherently unsafe"}

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Bike Austin \"Bike lanes and sidewalks have been proven to reduce crashes by up to 38 percent on Austin\u2019s streets.\"", "evidence": "CLARIFICATION, 3:46 p.m., Sept. 9, 2016: Shortly after this fact check posted, we revised a sentence to say that we didn't find research tying the addition of simple bike lanes to specific percentage reductions in crashes. We'd originally said we didn't see research generally tying bike lanes to crash reductions. Our rating of the group's claim didn't change.\nAfter a 14-year-old bicyclist was hit by a car and killed in Austin in June 2016, local nonprofit Bike Austin called on the city to make streets safer for bicyclists and pedestrians.\nIn a statement, the group\u2019s executive director, Mercedes Feris, said: \"Bike lanes and sidewalks have been proven to reduce crashes by up to 38 percent on Austin\u2019s streets.\"\nDoes that hold up?\nGroup cites city report\nTo our inquiry, Feris cited a 2015 City of Austin report, \"Redesigning the Street: A Report on Right-Sizing Projects in Austin, TX 1999-2014,\" analyzing the effects of a certain kind of project, called a road diet, designed to make streets safer by shrinking opportunities to drive too fast.\nIn what the Federal Highway Administration calls the classic example of a road diet, lane lines on a four-lane road that has two lanes in each direction are repainted to create a three-lane road, leaving a single lane in each direction and a center lane solely for left turns.\nA 2014 agency guide to road diets says the concept developed decades ago in response to the expansion-minded road construction of the 1950s and 1960s, when two-lane roads were frequently upgraded to four lanes. One of the first road diets, the guide says, was applied in 1979 to a four-lane road in Billings, Montana. On that road, where about 10,000 cars drove every day, the shrinkage to three lanes was found to reduce crashes without increasing delays.\nWe dug into Austin\u2019s more recent report and checked with experts on road diets and bicycle transportation. From that, we found that such projects often incorporate new bike lanes -- but they don\u2019t typically add sidewalks. Generally, too, the highway administration has found that crashes in which a car hits a pedestrian walking on the side of the road consistently fall by more than 50 percent when sidewalks are installed. We failed to identify research tying the addition of simple, striped\u00a0bike lanes to specific percentage reductions in crashes.\nThe cited city report covers 37 local road diets completed from 1999 through 2014, including the one that Feris pointed out, on a 1.6-mile stretch of Manor Road in Northeast Austin. It resulted, the report says, in a 38 percent drop in crashes.\nA city spokeswoman, Marissa Monroy, responded to our inquiry about the research, saying by email the 38 percent reduction in any kind of crash ties to nearly six years of data collected by the Austin Police Department before and after the road diet took place on the stretch of Manor Road between Theo Drive and East 51st Street in November 2010.\n\nA close-up aerial view from along the noted 1.6-mile segment of Manor Road after the road diet was completed. The road includes bike lanes and the hallmark of a road diet project: a center two-way left-turn lane.\nSOURCE: Google Earth.\nMonroy told us that in the three years before the project, from November 2007 through October 2010, the to-be-reconfigured section had 39 crashes involving any combination of motor vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians--adding up to one pedestrian death and 16 injury crashes involving motor vehicles. In the three years after the project, from December 2010 through November 2013, she said, the stretch had 24 crashes -- or 38.5 percent fewer -- with no fatalities and 14 injury crashes, one involving a pedestrian, two affecting bicyclists.\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning, as the city report says, that bike traffic on the segment increased 180 percent, from 54 bikes tallied in a 24-hour period before the project (and its bike lanes) was completed with 151 bikes in a similar period after.\n\n"}

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Jeff Greene Kendrick Meek was \"#1 in Florida in taking tobacco cash and then opposed a tax on cigars that would have helped pay for children's health care.\"", "evidence": "Congressman Kendrick Meek relishes a good cigar -- Padrons are his favorite, he told Cigar Aficionado\u00a0magazine in a 2008 profile. He hosts an annual cigar party and is known to hand out cigars to members of Congress and their staff, and the cigar industry has helped fund his recent campaigns, the magazine reported. Padron Cigars, a longtime family business, is headquartered in Little Havana in Miami.\n\nMeek's U.S. Senate Democratic primary opponent, Jeff Greene, attacks Meek for his ties to the tobacco industry in a campaign flier accusing Meek of standing with special interests.\n\nSpecifically, Greene wrote in a campaign flier that hit mailboxes around July 23, 2010, that Meek was \"#1 in Florida in taking tobacco cash and then opposed a tax on cigars that would have helped pay for children's health care.\" Greene this week introduced a new TV ad that stated \"Meek lobbied for big tobacco against children's health care.\"\n\nWe decided to examine the campaign flier. Did Meek rake in more money from the tobacco industry than anyone else in Florida and then oppose a tax on cigars that would pay for children's health care?\n\nGreene's campaign cited the Center for Responsive Politics -- an organization that analyzes campaign donations -- as part of its proof, so we turned there first to check tobacco donations for Meek's 2008 Congressional race and 2010 U.S. Senate race. The website shows that Meek received $77,325 from the tobacco industry in his 2010 race and $63,727 in his 2008 race. Those amounts put him at No. 1 among Florida candidates for House or Senate and Florida members of the House and Senate.\n\nBut Greene's flier said Meek was \"#1 in Florida\" and did not specify whether that was only among federal candidates. There is no simple way to thoroughly check tobacco donations to all candidates across Florida including for state Legislature.\n\nNext we checked Meek\u2019s voting record on the U.S. Library of Congress website, particularly in 2007 and 2009, on bills that would raise taxes on the tobacco industry to help pay for children's health care. Meek voted for the bill each time \u2013 but the background is more complex.\n\nWhile Meek touted the law, behind the scenes he helped Miami cigar maker Jorge Padron get a meeting with top Democrats including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi so Padron could lobby against higher taxes, the Miami Herald wrote on March 24, 2008. Padron later hosted a fundraiser for Meek.\n\nThe Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 would have increased excise tax rates on cigars, cigarettes, cigarette papers and tubes, smokeless tobacco, pipe tobacco, and roll-your-own tobacco. Meek voted for the bill, referred to as the Small Business Tax Relief Act in the House, on Feb. 16, 2007. President George W. Bush vetoed the bill. Meek voted again for the bill on Oct. 25, 2007, and again Bush vetoed it.\n\nThe taxes on cigars would have soared from 5 cents to $3, a 6,000 percent increase, the Miami Herald wrote. That tax hike was too high, Meek said in the 2008 article, but he also supported the health care legislation by voting for it.\n\nThe Miami Herald wrote, \"Asked why he would take a seemingly contrary stance by voting twice for the legislation, Meek explained that expanding healthcare was vital, adding, 'We knew it was going to be vetoed. ... My advocacy on behalf of the legislation is well documented in the congressional record. At the same time, I am sensitive to the fact that business owners facing a giant tax increase want to make sure that legislative leaders understand exactly what is going on. [The insurance program] is going to pass one day with my vote, but [I] don't want the small businesses in Florida and in my community run out of business.'\"\n\nMeek also explained his concerns in the Cigar Aficionado magazine profile.\n\n\"The goal of government is not to put small businesses out of business,\" Meek told Cigar Aficionado. \"Speaker Pelosi and Chairman (Charles) Rangel are not about putting small businesses out of business. I thought that the tax increase (from 20.7 to nearly 53 percent) on the handmade cigar industry went a little bit too far. Well, not a little bit too far; it went too far. This would have hurt not only a lot of businesses in South Florida, but also those countries where the tobacco comes from. The Dominican Republic would have felt a direct effect of such a large tax [increase]. Also Honduras. Also Nicaragua.\"\n\nIn 2009, the children\u2019s health care legislation came up again, this time to raise the federal excise tax on cigarettes 61 cents, from 39 cents a pack to $1.01 a pack, and raise taxes on other tobacco products. Meek voted in favor of the bill, along with nearly every Democrat in the house, according to a Jan. 14, 2009, press release from Meek. President Barack Obama signed the bill into law in February 2009.\n\nCigar makers credited Meek with helping reduce the amount of the tax on cigar manufacturers, according to a Jan. 15, 2009, Tampa Tribune article. The article quoted Eric Newman, president of the Cigar Manufacturers Association of Tampa, as saying Tampa Democratic Rep.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, \"offshore wind is a crucial renewable resource to be incorporated in the country's clean energy mix\" because 80 percent of energy use is in coastal states.\nThe federal Bureau of Ocean Energy management has identified three developable sites off the North Carolina coast that contain up to 3,740 megawatts of wind energy potential. That\u2019s nearly twice as much as the solar energy North Carolina produced in 2015, when it ranked third in the nation in solar output. So the potential is there. But is it the best?\nThe best states for wind\nHall didn\u2019t respond to our questions asking for evidence backing up his claim. So we looked up various maps and charts on our own, trying to find \"possibly the best place\" for offshore wind energy.\nA 2010 study by the federal government\u2019s National Renewable Energy Laboratory measured offshore wind power potential in each state. North Carolina ranked fifth behind Hawaii, California, Michigan and Louisiana. Here's a map from the lab:\n\nThe study measured total wind power and did not factor how much space would be realistically unusable due to developmental or environmental issues.\nBut taking reality into consideration, Cristina Archer, a University of Delaware professor who studies renewable energy, said North Carolina is \"a pretty awesome state for offshore wind.\"\n\n"}

Jeff Fitzgerald (R-Horicon), the incoming Assembly speaker.\n\nIn a Nov. 29, 2010 news release under the headline \"Democrats continue closed-door deals,\" Fitzgerald warned against a possible December special session to approve labor deals with state employee unions before Republicans take control in January.\n\nHe then reached back a year to portray a pattern of bad conduct: \"In 2009, (Gov.) Jim Doyle and the Democrats rushed through a budget repair bill with billions in tax increases and held no public hearings.\"\n\nAs devoted Madison watchers, that raised a few obvious questions: Were there really no hearings, not a one? And \"billions\" of tax hikes slipped into a bill meant to fix a mid-budget shortfall?\n\nIn short: Is Fitzgerald rewriting history?\n\nWhen we asked Fitzgerald spokesman Jim Bender about the tax figure, he told us he erred in using \"billions.\"\n\nOops.\n\nThe Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the official scorekeeper, estimated the repair bill would raise $290 million from tax changes. The main source was \"combined reporting,\" in which lawmakers closed what some viewed as a loophole that allowed corporations to shuffle profits to subsidiaries in states that don\u2019t tax them.\n\nIf a new fee on hospital revenue was included, the new revenue total was $1.2 billion over three years, according to the fiscal bureau.\n\nThat element features its own mini debate:\n\nThe fiscal bureau calls the hospital assessment a fee. Media reports commonly referred to it as a tax. Hospitals backed the fee because it allowed the state to tap a large new stream of federal money that boosts Medicaid reimbursement to hospitals; Republicans derided it as a \"sick tax\" that would raise costs to patients.\n\nBender told us he counted the hospital fees as a tax -- but mistakenly used \"billions.\"\n\n\"Normally, I use specifics, but in this instance generalized,\" he said.\n\nSo, the underlying math in the statement is off -- by either $800 million or $1.71 billion, depending on how you view the hospital fee.\n\nBut what about the way the bill was passed?\n\nIt was pushed through the Legislature at warp speed -- two days -- when compared with four previous repair bills dating to 2002. The range on those was from 21 to 150 days. The speed was partly a function of the Democrats controlling both houses and the governor\u2019s office.\n\nAs for the lack of public hearings, Fitzgerald is right -- there were none.\n\nBut a look into the past shows a spotty record on such hearings when it comes to budget repair \u00a0bills -- with Republicans and Democrats both on the hook for blame or credit.\n\nWe looked back at four such bills -- one in 2002 offered by Republican Gov. Scott McCallum -- and three earlier fixes under Doyle, a Democrat. Budget repair bills have become much more common in recent years as the economy sagged.\n\nOn the earlier Doyle bills, the Legislature twice held public hearings. In one case, Republicans controlled both chambers; the parties shared control in the other.\n\nBut in 2007, another year with split control, no public hearing accompanied the action.\n\nUnder McCallum in 2002, lawmakers convened two such hearings on a highly contentious plan. The two parties split control at that time as well.\n\nLet\u2019s consign this discussion to the dustbin of history.\n\nNo matter how you add it up, Fitzgerald misfired badly on the tax figure he used in his news release slamming Democrats. His own aide admitted it. He is correct on the rushed nature of the 2009 budget fix. On the question of public hearings, Fitzgerald is right there were none -- but his rhetoric skipped past the fact such hearings have not always been held.

The error does not change the ruling.\n\nPortland commissioner Amanda Fritz, running for another term, is proud that in her first year in office, she came out against a recommendation by the Water Bureau to build an expensive direct filtration system. Instead, she supported was to build a cheaper ultraviolet system that would zap cryptosporidium from the city\u2019s drinking water.\n\n\"In 2009, I saved ratepayers around $500 million by persuading the Council to pursue a less expensive compliance mechanism if the City is required to treat Bull Run drinking water,\" Fritz writes on her campaign literature. \"I partnered with neighborhood and business advocates to get this done by arranging for a Council work session and public hearing, where citizens made clear that the less expensive option is more responsible. The result was a unanimous vote reversing the Water Bureau\u2019s previous plan.\"\n\nWe here at PolitiFact Oregon take these campaign claims seriously. Was it true that Fritz had single-handedly, with citizen support and a public hearing, persuaded the City Council to go against a recommendation by the Water Bureau? And did she in fact save ratepayers $500 million?\n\nPortland gets its drinking water pretty much untouched from the Bull Run watershed east of the city. It\u2019s delicious and clean and we\u2019re all very proud of it. However, we\u2019re also under orders from the Environmental Protection Agency to protect the water we drink, following a cryptosporidius outbreak that killed at least 69 people in 1993 in Wisconsin.\n\nThat means we need to do something about the open reservoirs where we store some of our drinking water and we have to treat against cryptosporidium, even though the last time we found any was in 2002.\n\nAll the city commissioners think the federal mandate is unnecessary. But they\u2019ve made plans to comply even as they seek a way out of some of the conditions. In 2009, the Water Bureau recommended meeting the cryptosporidium criteria with a $385 million filtration system that they argued would cost more, but be more versatile and forward-thinking in the end.\n\nGroups such as Friends of the Reservoirs and beer makers Rob and Kurt Widmer lobbied against the filtration system. They argued that if anything had to be done, why not opt for ultraviolet light, which would be cheaper to build at $100 million.\n\nCity Council meeting records show that \u00a0Fritz, along with commissioners Dan Saltzman and Nick Fish, voiced concerns about the cost. But Commissioner Randy Leonard, who oversees water, backed his staff, and at City Hall, it\u2019s considered bad form to go against the commissioner in charge.\n\nFritz and Saltzman went on record as opposed to Leonard. As the council vote neared, Leonard realized he didn\u2019t have Fish either. Leonard agreed to go with UV, saying that he doesn\u2019t think anybody \"has ever accused me of being a bad vote counter.\"\n\nSo is it fair for Fritz to hog the leadership limelight? We asked the two commissioners who also expressed doubts about filtration. They said it was absolutely fair. \"She kind of pushed it; she called the question. It\u2019s an accurate claim, for what it\u2019s worth,\" Saltzman said.\n\nFish said Fritz and Saltzman were on the same page, but, \"I think she was the one who was the most outspoken on this one. Ultimately, she persuaded me that UV was the right way to go and \u2026 I became the third vote on UV.\"\n\nFritz doesn\u2019t have a lot of high-profile scores on her record as she defends her seat against Mary Nolan.

Jon Huntsman touted his record on taxes. When he was governor, he said, Utah had \"historic tax cuts.

Our PolitiFact team in New Hampshire\u00a0 checked a similar comment Huntsman made at a July 4th, 2011, house party in Belmont, N.H. At that July 4 event, Huntsman said that when he was governor, he worked with the state Legislature to create a flat tax that \"cut income taxes by 30 percent.\"\n\nSince Huntsman didn\u2019t repeat the claim that this tax changes had \"cut income taxes by 30 percent,\" we will only rate him now on the question of whether his administration \"created a flat tax in the state of Utah.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen we first reported this item, the Huntsman campaign pointed us to published reports from this spring and from 2007 that explained how Huntsman began pushing for the changes soon after he took office in January 2005.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"We need a tax policy that is not only friendly to our citizens, but also creates a competitive environment for business. Business as usual will leave us behind our neighboring states,\" Huntsman said during his first State of the State speech in January 2005.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nHuntsman and the Legislature achieved their goal with two changes in tax law over two years.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen Huntsman took office, there were six income tax brackets ranging from 2.3 percent to 7 percent. Ultimately, Huntsman and the Legislature approved a single rate of 5 percent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThis created a much flatter tax, stripping away most of the deductions and credits. Utah taxpayers still adjust their income in ways such as counting interest earned on bond income or deducting from income the withdrawals they make from medical savings accounts.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe research arm of the Utah Legislature says this was not a flat tax in the purest sense. \"Although the new system has a single statutory rate of 5.0 percent, it is not a proportional or 'flat' income tax system. Rather, Utah\u2019s new income tax system remains progressive through tax credits,'' said a January 2010 report of the Utah Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel. (A progressive tax system is one in which richer people pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than poorer people do.)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nRoughly 90 percent of taxpayers get to claim as a credit from state taxes some of what they claim as deductions and tax exemptions under the federal tax code. The credit phases out and goes away from those making very high incomes in the state.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThis makes the effective tax rate about 3 percent for Utah taxpayers earning $70,000 a year in 2008 and 4 percent for a household with $100,000 in taxable income, according to the legislative group's analysis.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"There's no question this is a single rate tax -- but with the credit, the overwhelming majority of taxpayers do not pay 5 percent of their income,'' said Phil Dean, the policy analyst who authored the 2010 study.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAnti-tax groups have given Huntsman high marks for the overhaul and have said they consider it to be a flat tax.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe libertarian Cato Institute gave Huntsman the highest score of any governor on tax policy in 2006. Likewise, the Club for Growth praised Huntsman's tax reform while adding there were some \"minor blemishes\"' that included other tax increases during his tenure. (It's worth noting that both groups fault Huntsman for increases in state spending that occurred under his watch.)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile we gave Huntsman a Mostly False for his previous statement, most of our downgrade stemmed from our criticism of his claim that his policies \"cut income taxes by 30 percent.\" The system he and the Legislature enacted in Utah wasn\u2019t a pure flat tax, since taxpayers may still make adjustments for certain financial factors. But it is a flatter tax, and it includes one major defining factor of a flat tax -- a single rate for all income groups"}

Sen. Jim DeMint, R.-S.C., for example, said he would not support the plan because he considered the estate tax compromise a tax increase. We ruled that claim Barely True.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont and a self-described democratic socialist, sent out a message via Twitter on Dec. 13, 2010, saying that under the estate tax plan, \"99.7% of American families will not pay 1 nickel in an estate tax. This is not a tax on the rich, this is a tax on the very, very, very rich.\"\n\nAccording to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, Sanders is correct.\n\nThe Tax Policy Center estimated that about 99.7 percent of estates were exempt from the estate tax in 2009 when the first $3.5 million of an estate was exempt. Even fewer people would be subject to the tax if the threshold is increased to $5 million, as proposed in the compromise tax plan.\n\nUnder the compromise plan, less than 2/10 of 1 percent of estates would be subject to the estate tax next year, said Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center. That means more than 99.8 percent would be completely exempt.\n\u00a0\nThe Tax Policy Center estimates that about 3,600 estates would be subject to the tax under the $5 million threshold. Those 3,600 estates would have to pay an estimated $11.4 billion in estate taxes under the compromise tax plan.\n\nEstate tax rates have fluctuated through modern history. In 2001, President George W. Bush signed a plan to gradually reduce the estate tax from 55 percent to 45 percent, while at the same time increasing the exemption value from $1 million in 2002 to $3.5 million in 2009. The estate tax disappeared altogether in 2010.\n\nBut the Bush plan only had a 10-year window because Republicans didn't have the votes at the time to permanently abolish the estate tax. It passed the Senate under budget reconciliation, which requires only a simple majority of 51 votes but which also limited it to a 10-year shelf life. Barring a new tax agreement, the rate was set to revert next year to a 55 percent rate with an effective exemption of $1 million.\n\nLast year, Democrats proposed a plan to permanently set the estate tax rate at 2009 levels -- 45 percent on the value of estates over $3.5 million. But the plan never reached a vote in the Senate. Had that plan gone through, the Tax Policy Center estimates it would have subjected 6,460 estates to a tax (bring in an estimated $18.2 billion). If no tax plan passes, and the rate goes back to 55 percent on the value of estates over $1 million, an 43,540 estates would have to pay (bringing in an estimated $34.4 billion next year).\n\nSanders was correct that in 2009, when the effective exemption was $3.5 million, about 99.7 percent of all estates were exempt and didn't pay anything. The compromise plan -- which would set effective exemption at $5 million -- would push the number of exempted estates even higher, so that more than 99.8 percent of estates would not pay anything"}

We contacted a Westmoreland spokeswoman to get the story.\n\nLeslie Shedd, the spokeswoman, said Westmoreland was referring to three programs that were started to keep the housing market stable and encourage Americans to buy homes: Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the FHA.\n\nHere\u2019s how the feds got involved in the housing market:\n\nAfter the real estate market collapsed during the Great Depression, the feds took steps to encourage banks to make home loans and families to buy houses.\n\nThey created the FHA, which issues mortgage insurance to guarantee that banks will get their money back even if a homeowner doesn\u2019t make payments. This encourages banks to approve mortgages for people who don\u2019t have a lot of money or have mediocre credit.\n\nThey also created Fannie Mae, and later Freddie Mac, to help lenders raise money to make more loans. Fannie and Freddie do this by selling the mortgages lenders\u2019 make in bulk as securities and guaranteeing they will make a return.\n\nOther programs perform similar tasks. For instance, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, like the FHA, insures home loans, but only for houses in rural areas. The Office of Public and Indian Housing backs them for native lands, while the Department of Veterans Affairs guarantees them for veterans.\n\nGinnie Mae, like Fannie and Freddie, guarantees mortgage securities, but its securities are made up of government-backed loans by the FHA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and Public and Indian Housing.\n\nThis is what our research found:\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac\n\nFannie and Freddie were bailed out by taxpayers in 2008. But calling them \"federal housing programs\" is a thorny issue.\n\nThey weren\u2019t controlled by the government until the bailout.\n\nCongress chartered Fannie and Freddie as \"government-sponsored enterprises,\" or GSEs. They are supposed to help the U.S. meet its housing policy goals, but they were designed as for-profit corporations with their own shareholders and boards of directors. The federal government explicitly said it did not back the GSEs\u2019 securities.\n\n\"They are in no way categorized as federal housing programs,\" said Ted Gayer, co-director of the economic studies program at the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe feds estimate the bailout will cost between $220 billion and $311 billion through 2014, though some of that will be paid back.\n\nFederal Housing Administration\n\nThe president\u2019s proposed budget for 2013 says the U.S. Treasury might have to give the FHA $688 million in emergency funds, but whether help will come in the form of a taxpayer-funded bailout is uncertain.\n\nThe FHA hiked the cost of mortgage insurance earlier this month to raise money, and it is set to receive about $1 billion from a legal settlement over fraudulent foreclosure practices. Its officials say these measures will avoid a bailout, but critics say this won\u2019t be enough.\n\nGinnie Mae\n\nGinnie Mae hasn\u2019t been bailed out, and it\u2019s not clear it\u2019s in dire trouble.\n\nA November 2011 General Accounting Office report found that higher-than-expected defaults could force Ginnie Mae to dip into its reserves. It also concluded that Ginnie should do better at predicting future costs and documenting its methods. \u00a0\n\nBut so far, Ginnie has taken in more money than it has spent, the GAO said.\n\nAll the rest\n\nThe remainder of the federal programs are smaller players in the mortgage markets.\n\nAs of the second quarter of 2011, the FHA backed nearly $1 trillion in single-family loans. Veterans Affairs backed less than a quarter of that, while the USDA backed some 7 percent, according to data from the federal agency that took over Fannie and Freddie. \u00a0\n\nThey have yet to run into the kinds of trouble that Fannie, Freddie and the FHA are experiencing. \u00a0\n\nThe USDA and PIH have not needed a bailout so far, but Edward Pinto, a former Fannie Mae executive and scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, warns the USDA might need one, in part because it makes riskier loans. \u00a0\n\nThe FHA requires down payments of 3.5 percent. The USDA allows loans with no money down.\n\nAs for Veterans Affairs, the word \"bailout\" does not apply. Whenever one of its loans defaults, taxpayers automatically pick up the tab. The program is not expected to pay for itself.\n\nConclusion\n\nWestmoreland\u2019s claim that \"there is not one single federal housing program yet that has not needed a bailout to survive\" has shortcomings. \u00a0\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been bailed out. And the FHA is in need of help, though it has not been bailed out at this point.\n\nBut Fannie and Freddie did not come under federal control until 2008. They are strange creatures on the U.S. financial landscape. They were created by the government but operated independently until the housing bust. At that time, they were bailed out by the feds.\n\nThe three other federal housing efforts have not been bailed out. And it\u2019s not clear that they will need taxpayer assistance.\n\nFannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the FHA are much larger players in the housing market. This bolsters Westmoreland\u2019s larger point that organizations designed to help the housing market need help, too"}

Then, he called out what he sees as another unfairness.\n\"It\u2019s our system of health care,\" he said, \"where you see disparities in infant mortality between white Americans and black Americans greater today, in 2019, than in the year 1850 - 15 years before the abolition of slavery.\"\nWe fact-checked whether the racial gap in infant mortality has, indeed, widened over the last 169 years.\nLet\u2019s start with a definition: The infant mortality rate is the number deaths before age 1 per 1,000 live births.\nChris Evans, communications director for O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign, sent us an email saying the candidate got his information from an April 11, 2018, article in The New York Times Magazine headlined, \"Why America\u2019s Black Mothers and Babies Are in a Life-or-Death Crisis.\"\nThe article cites estimates of child mortality in 1850 that were made by economists Michael Haines of Colgate University and Richard Steckel of The Ohio State University. Haines concluded that in 1850, the\u00a0infant mortality rate for blacks was about 340 per 1,000; Steckel estimated the white rate was 217 per 1,000.\nThe Times compared those estimates\u00a0to modern rates computed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2016, the latest year available, the infant mortality rate for blacks was 11.4 per 1,000. For whites, it was 4.9 per 1,000.\nIn other words, in 1850, blacks were 1.6 times more likely to die in infancy than whites. In 2016, blacks were 2.3 times more likely to die in infancy than whites. That shows \"a racial disparity that is actually wider than in 1850, 15 years before the end of slavery,\" The Times article said.\nHaines, who developed the 1850 black estimate, said O\u2019Rourke\u2019s statement is \"right,\" but tells an incomplete story about infant mortality since the decade before the Civil War. \"There has been remarkable improvement for both races; really quite dramatic,\" he said.\nThe estimates roughly show that in 1850, one in three black infants died in the first year compared to one in five white newborns. In 2016, CDC statistics show one in 88 black infants died before the first birthday compared to one in 204 whites.\n\n"}

The resulting November 2016 McClatchy news story\u00a0also quoted\u00a0Williams saying: \"NAFTA allows a lot of trucks from Mexico. ... They can drive through without even being inspected. That concerns me.\"\nWe wondered if Williams, whose district runs from Austin north and west nearly into Tarrant County, was right about uninspected trucks.\nTo be sure, the 1994 trade agreement committed the bordering nations to allowing each other\u2019s trucks to carry goods across the border and make deliveries anywhere inside their respective countries. But implementation proved bumpy, we learned, and few trucks from Mexico lately trundle outside of border commercial zones.\nAlso, trucks from Mexico might not be safety threats in themselves. A federal pilot project -- involving over 900 long-haul trucks traveling from Mexico over three years ending in fall 2014 -- showed \"Mexico-domiciled motor carriers operating beyond the commercial zones\" on the border \"had safety records that were equal to or better than the national average for U.S. and Canadian motor carriers operating in the United States,\" the Department of Transportation told Congress in 2015.\nStill, are a lot of trucks rumbling across the border uninspected?\nWe sent emails inquiring into Williams\u2019 factual backup and asking Customs and Border Protection, the agency most associated with border security, to assess his claim.\nA Williams\u2019 spokesman, Vince Zito, responded by phone that Williams based his assessment on his background as Texas secretary of state, whose duties include border issues, and past membership of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.\nOutside analysis\nBefore hearing back from CBP, we connected with experts including Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.\nWilson advised\u00a0that only a handful of Mexico-based carriers currently haul cargo beyond the commercial zones along the border.\nReason: It\u2019s often unprofitable, Wilson and Juan Carlos Villa, who studies freight traffic across the border for the Texas A&M Transportation Institute,\u00a0told us by phone.\nA key issue is that under \"cabotage\" regulations, a truck that originates in Mexico may drop off goods in the U.S. interior but can\u2019t also move goods solely within the U.S. And, Villa said, while a\u00a0Mexico-rooted truck may haul a U.S. load back to Mexico,\u00a0lining up such cargo can prove difficult, causing costly delays. In contrast, the alternative--driving an empty trailer back to Mexico--\"doesn\u2019t make business sense,\" Villa said. A web search led us to 2012\u00a0Department of Homeland Security guidelines\u00a0confirming the described limits.\nAnother deterrence to long-haul trucks venturing into the interior from Mexico, Wilson said, are the\u00a0typically long delays at border crossings. As a result, Wilson said, it's more commonplace for\u00a0other trucks to trundle cargo into the U.S. commercial zones where transfers are then made to U.S. lines, a practice called drayage.\nWilson, asked to appraise Williams\u2019 claim, said: \"I don\u2019t \u00a0know what kind of inspection he means. We don\u2019t allow anyone into the United States without some level of inspection.\"\n\n"}

PolitiFact Ohio decided to look into Hanauer\u2019s claim to see if she has her facts straight.\n\nBefore we were able to reach Hanauer, Internet research produced news reports from this year about subsidized lunch statistics in Ohio. A story The Columbus Dispatch published February 13, citing statistics from the Ohio Department of Education, reported that four out of 10 Ohio students receive free or reduced-price lunch through a federal program for low-income students.\n\nWe called the Department of Education for the statistics used in the story. A department spokesman handed over data it received from the National School Lunch Program, which is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nThe National School Lunch Program provides cash subsidies to public and private schools across the country to serve free and reduced-price lunches to eligible children.\n\nThe data, collected in October and released in February, shows 825,469 Ohio students received free or reduced-priced lunch out of 1,876,355 students who attend Ohio schools participating in the National School Lunch Program. Of those students participating in the program, 716,084 receive free lunch and 109,385 received reduced-price lunch.\n\nBased on those numbers, about 44 percent of students at Ohio schools participating in the federal subsidized lunch program qualify for the benefit \u2013 exceeding the four-in-10 ratio Hanauer cited.\n\nBut are there Ohio schools that don\u2019t participate in the federal subsidized lunch program? If so, the overall percentage of Ohio students getting free or reduced-priced lunch could drop below 40 percent.\n\nWe checked back with the Department of Education to get the total number of students in the state. There are about 2,042,538 students in Ohio, according to the department. So we plugged the new total into our calculation (825,469 students getting subsidized lunch divided by 2.04 million kids) and the result was 40.4 percent \u2013 equal to a 4-to-10 ratio.\n\nSo Hanauer was correct in citing the ratio of Ohio kids getting a subsidized lunch. She also called the statistic a record. How does that stack up?\n\nSimilar data from the Department of Education was readily available dating back to 2002. Since 2002, the highest percentage of students receiving subsidized lunch was, in fact, in 2010.\n\nIn 2009, which saw the second-highest participation, 42 percent of students at schools participating in the federal program received subsidized lunch (compared to 44 percent in 2010).\n\nHanauer\u2019s speech was spot-on about the ratio of kids receiving subsidized lunch.\n\nAs for calling the ratio a record, neither the Department of Education nor the USDA provided data that showed a higher percentage in the past"}

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Barack Obama Says Romney invested in a firm that made goods in China that \"could have been made here in America.\"", "evidence": "America\u2019s fraught relationship with China seems to creep into every modern presidential election. This time the argument is over which candidate has done more to boost Asia\u2019s largest economy at America\u2019s expense. Mitt Romney slams President Barack Obama for being soft on enforcing trade rules with China. In a television ad, the Obama campaign punches back, saying as an investor, Romney sent American jobs to the very country he promises to boot into line.\n\nThe Obama ad gets personal. It says \"Even today part of Romney\u2019s fortune is invested in China.\" We wondered if that attack was on the money.\n\nTo the extent that some of Romney\u2019s funds can be traced to China, the claim is accurate. In fact, the Romney campaign confirmed it. In an email exchange with us, staff made no bones about it. The candidate has money in Chinese companies.\n\nThe campaign noted that Romney has his assets in a blind trust and the trustee is in charge. Staff described Romney\u2019s role in his Chinese investments as passive; he does not decide which funds will get his money and the fund managers pick the places where to invest. The campaign also had something to say about Obama\u2019s investments, which we\u2019ll get to in a bit.\n\n Romney\u2019s investments\n\nWe can trace some examples of how this plays out.\n\nIn the personal financial disclosure he filed as a presidential candidate, Romney listed an investment in Bain Capital Asia in the range of $100,000 to $250,000. This is a small amount relative to his estimated net worth of $250 million.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Bain Capital Asia purchased a Chinese video surveillance company, Uniview Technologies, in December 2011. The firm supplies cameras and software to police so they can keep watch over public spaces such as universities and commercial centers and share information with their counterparts elsewhere in the country.\n\nBain Capital Asia has multiple investments and multiple investors, so the Romney stake in Uniview Technologies is highly diluted. But in some small way, his money is there.\n\nWhen news of the investment broke in March, Romney told reporters he knew nothing about it.\n\n\"Any investments that I make are managed by a blind trust,\" he said. \"I don't make investments in Bain or anywhere else. That's done by a trustee who makes decisions that he thinks are correct.\"\n\nThat trustee, R. Bradford Malt, issued a statement, cited in the New York Times, that he had put the money into the Bain fund before it purchased Uniview. Malt said the Romneys had no say in the matter and that he himself had no control over the fund\u2019s choice of investments.\n\nAccording to the Boston Globe, Romney reported at least half a million dollars invested in another Bain fund that is a major shareholder in the Chinese retailer Gome.\n\nThe blind trust puts Romney at some distance from his Chinese investments. Presumably, if the New York Times hadn\u2019t written about Uniview, he wouldn\u2019t have known where his money was.\n\nRomney\u2019s blind trust\n\nWe should note that not all blind trusts are created equal. Romney\u2019s meets the requirements in Massachusetts. His trust would not pass muster in Washington.\n\n\"It\u2019s a blind trust only to the extent that Romney calls it that and describes it that way,\" said Meredith McGehee, policy director at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan group focused on government ethics.\n\nRomney is much closer to his trustee, Malt, than federal rules would allow. The two men both have close ties to Bain Capital, Romney as founder, and Malt as a lawer to the firm. Romney retains large investments in Bain. None of this matches the criteria of independence and arm\u2019s length dealings that are spelled out in the federal rules.\n\nFor one thing, the Office of Government Ethics, the agency that oversees the rules, allows only financial institutions to be trustees; individuals need not apply. Second, the rules would block someone with Malt\u2019s history with Romney and Bain. The regulations state that the office will only accept a trustee who \"is not and has not been employed by any interested party, not served as a director, officer, or employee of any organization affiliated with any interested party.\" Romney is the \"interested party,\" and Malt\u2019s work with Bain alone would disqualify him.\n\nObama\u2019s China connection\n\nThe Romney campaign claims that President Obama has money invested in China too, albeit indirectly. The president\u2019s financial disclosure shows he has retirement money in Vanguard mutual funds and the Illinois pension plan.Those funds list investments in some 500 companies, including Apple, Wal Mart, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and General Electric.\n\nThose firms have employees and in some cases, manufacturing facilities in China, which relates to another campaign hot-button issue, outsourcing. However, the companies themselves are based in the U.S. The investments involve domestic, not international, stock purchases.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe Obama campaign ad says, \"Even today part of Romney\u2019s fortune is invested in China.\"\n\nThe Romney campaign confirms this statement. In particular, news reports show as recently as this year, Romney had money invested in funds that owned shares in two Chinese firms. The amount is not likely to be large, certainly relative to Romney\u2019s sizeable assets, and might be minor in absolute terms as well, due to the dilution that comes with funds with multiple investors and multiple investments.\n\nThe claim suggests that Romney had more to do with the investment decision than is the case"}

In 2006, there were 14,267 international companies registered in Bermuda, many of them American owned, according to the U.S. State Department. A 2004 GAO report also listed Bermuda as a tax haven.\n\n\nTo come up with its $50,000 number, the Obama campaign compiled a list of 30 people and one political action committee connected to insurance and reinsurance companies based in Bermuda. We obtained a copy of the list from the campaign and cross-checked with Federal Election Commission records and found it to be accurate.\n\n\nIt seems likely that the Obama campaign's numbers undercounted contributions from lobbyists connected to Bermuda-based insurance companies.

Doctors had been handing out so many narcotic painkillers that some veterans had taken to calling the place \"Candy Land.\"\n\n\nPrior to that, on Aug. 29, 2014, Baldwin\u2019s office received a report from the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 Office of Inspector General following a 2\u00bd-year investigation of Tomah. Baldwin did not make the report public, though she shared it with a constituent who had complained to her about what was happening at Tomah. The report was not given to any other member of Congress at the time.\n\n\nA day later, Simcakoski died of a \"mixed use toxicity\" overdose at the Tomah VA while being treated by doctors there. Simcakoski had checked himself into the facility citing an addiction to painkillers and severe anxiety. He was prescribed 15 drugs, including anti-psychotics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants and the opioid painkiller tramadol.\n\n\nIn fact, after months of criticism about inaction on a whistleblower\u2019s complaints about Tomah, Baldwin acknowledged her office had made mistakes, leading her to fire one staffer, demote another and dock the pay of her chief of staff.\n\n\nVukmir has hammered Baldwin for months over the issue.\nDuring a September 2018 appearance on \u00a0\"Capital City Sunday\" on WKOW-TV, she said Baldwin was the only member of the Wisconsin congressional delegation \"to have a report outlining that a doctor was overprescribing opioids\" at the Tomah VA, \"later a veteran died\" and Baldwin \"covered it up.\"\nWe rated Vukmir\u2019s overall claim Mostly False.\nWe found that Baldwin was the only one with the report and that she didn\u2019t make the report public or go public with her concerns until the scandal made news.

She then said, \"I support, I have always supported the (Conservation) 20/20 program.\"\n\nShe led a unanimous vote to continue funding the program.\n\nSo where did Jackow's accusation come from?\n\n\"It was in The News-Press,\" Jackow said. \"(Hall) said she would consider touching the 20/20 money.\"\n\nA July 7 News-Press article said, \"Commission Chairwoman Tammy Hall said the board should be looking ahead to further cost-cutting measures.

Rather, she claims that cheaper health care will allow businesses to hire more workers, thus creating more jobs. \"Imagine an economy where people could change jobs, start businesses, become self-employed, whether to pursue their artistic aspirations or be entrepreneurial and start new businesses, if they were not job-locked because they have a child who's bipolar, or a family member who's diabetic with a pre-existing condition, and all of the other constraints that having health care or not having health care places on an entrepreneurial spirit,\" she said.We'll start out by noting that both sides claim that health care reform will either create or destroy many jobs.The Democrats assume that their bills will make health care less expensive, meaning that employers will have more money to hire more workers. For instance, Obama's Council of Economic Advisers estimated in December that health care reform could create 320,000 additional jobs. The Republicans, however, are claiming the opposite. They maintain that the House and Senate versions of the bill, as well as a recently released proposal by Obama, would levy such hefty fines on employers -- if they don't offer their employees health insurance -- that employers would end up laying off workers to keep costs down. To back up this claim, they point to a Congressional Budget Office report from July 2009 that cited several older studies. One study from 2007 estimates that 224,000 workers could be unemployed if employers were required to provide insurance that cost, on average, $2 per hour worked. A second study, also published in 2007, found that an employer mandate could cost about 750,000 jobs.

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Mitt Romney President Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid support Rick Perry\u2019s \"decision to give in-state tuition to illegal immigrants.\"", "evidence": "To ominous background music, a video posted online by Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign opens with a narrator asking, \"Who supports Gov. (Rick) Perry\u2019s decision to give in-state tuition to illegal immigrants?\"\n\nNext, photographs of President Barack Obama, U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada appear onscreen, one after the other. That\u2019s followed by a November 2003 video clip of Vicente Fox, Mexico\u2019s president at the time, thanking Perry for Texas\u2019 2001 law enabling some illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at the state\u2019s public colleges and universities. Fox\u2019s thanks, which were videotaped by C-SPAN, were offered during a visit to Austin.\n\nThat moment aside, we wondered if Romney, the former Massachusetts governor vying with Perry and others for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, was correct in saying that the three Democratic leaders support Perry\u2019s action.\n\nThis fall, Romney and other candidates have hammered Perry for the Texas law, which Perry has defended as giving solid students opportunities not to be drags on society. Also, Perry has accurately noted that the proposal cleared the Texas House and Senate with minimal opposition.\n\nUnder the Texas law, undocumented immigrants with a Texas high school diploma or GED who have lived in Texas for at least three years can qualify for in-state tuition if they sign an affidavit saying they intend to apply for permanent residency as soon as they can.\n\nWe asked Romney\u2019s campaign staff for backup on the Sept. 29, 2011, video\u2019s claims. Spokesman Ryan Williams pointed us to news stories and government web pages showing Obama, Pelosi and Reid backing versions of the proposed federal DREAM Act, which would provide a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, if they attend college or serve in the military.\n\nWe\u2019ll explore the DREAM Act aspect in a moment.\n\nFirst, we wondered whether any of the Democratic leaders have spoken explicitly about the Texas law.\n\nRomney\u2019s material offered nothing specific about that, though it noted that as a member of the Illinois Senate, Obama co-sponsored legislation to allow undocumented immigrant students to pay in-state tuition at public colleges and universities. That measure became law in 2003.\n\nLike the Texas law, the Illinois act requires benefiting students to have a high school diploma or GED from an institution in the state and to sign affidavits swearing to apply for permanent legal residency. Texas requires students to have lived in the state for three years prior to receiving a diploma/GED while Illinois requires that the students attended school in-state for the three years before they received a diploma/GED.\n\nAccording to legislative records, Obama was one of 26 senators listed as co-sponsors of the proposal. He does not appear to have been a key advocate; none of 40 news items that we found published on the measure in 2002-03 mentions him.\n\nIn interviews and by email, aides for Pelosi, Reid and Obama each said their boss had not spoken about the Texas law.\n\nWe found no news accounts showing otherwise. More broadly, news reports yielded no flat endorsements by the Democratic leaders of state laws allowing in-state tuition for illegal immigrants, yet also no indications that any of the three object.\n\nDuring a 2007 visit to Arizona, Pelosi made what the Arizona Republic described as a \"reference to the effect of\" a state law barring illegal immigrants from getting in-state tuition rates.\n\nThe paper\u2019s Feb. 20, 2007, news story says Pelosi described meeting a prospective student who could not prove she was a legal U.S. resident and then said: \"Our country does not benefit by our depriving young people of an education.\"\n\nHer comment, though, falls short of calling for in-state tuition for illegal immigrants.\n\nAsked to clarify Obama\u2019s position on in-state tuition laws, White House spokesman Adam Abrams told us that he has not weighed in on the issue as president.\n\nHowever, Obama recently voiced a sentiment similar to Pelosi\u2019s: Speaking in support of the DREAM Act during a May 10, 2011, address in El Paso, Obama said that \"we should stop punishing innocent young people for the actions of their parents. We should stop denying them the chance to earn an education.\"\n\nReid has used similar words. Romney\u2019s campaign cites a 2007 example in which MSNBC quotes Reid arguing for the DREAM Act: \"Children should not be penalized for the actions of their parents.\"\n\nBut does the Democrats\u2019 support for the DREAM Act \u2014 confirmed by their spokesmen \u2014 back up Romney\u2019s claim?\n\nMost DREAM Act versions, including those pending before the U.S. House and Senate, would repeal a 1996 federal provision that some people interpret as a ban on states allowing illegal immigrants to qualify for in-state college tuition rates unless everyone legally in the U.S. can get the same benefit. The provision says: \"An alien who is not lawfully present in the United States shall not be eligible on the basis of residence within a state (or a political subdivision) for any post-secondary education benefit unless a citizen or national of the United States is eligible for such a benefit (in no less an amount, duration and scope) without regard to whether the citizen or national is such a resident.\"\n\n"}

{"label": "false", "claim": "Grover Norquist In Virginia \"there has been a billion dollars in surplus over the last three years. The legislature has spent less than 1 percent of that on roads.\"", "evidence": "Grover Norquist, one of the most influential voices in the United States against raising taxes, is opposed to Gov. Bob McDonnell\u2019s transportation plan.\n\nMcDonnell\u2019s proposal to generate $3.2 billion over five years relies, in part, on ending the state\u2019s fixed 17.5-cent per gallon gas tax and increasing the 5 percent sales tax to 5.8 percent. The plan also would raise the annual $41 registration fee for most vehicles to $56.\n\nNorquist, who is president of the Americans for Tax Reform, says those two parts of McDonnell\u2019s plan qualify as tax increases. He has warned the 30 Republican state legislators who have signed his organization\u2019s pledge to oppose tax increases that support of McDonnell\u2019s plan would break their promise.\n\nNorquist says Virginia should find a way to fix its roads without raising taxes. One way to do that, he said during a Feb. 7 radio interview, would be to earmark the state\u2019s budget surpluses for transportation.\n\n\"There\u2019s been over $1 billion in surplus over the last three years, the legislature has spent less than 1 percent of that on roads,\" Norquist said on the John Fredericks Show. \u00a0\"So if you can\u2019t prioritize unexpected revenue because the economy grew faster than you were planning, when can you begin to prioritize roads?\"\n\nWe wondered whether Virginia really has spent less than 1 percent of its surplus on roads during the last three years.\n\nWe contacted Paul Blair, a spokesman for Americans for Tax Reform. He said Norquist\u2019s statement was based on press clippings and budget presentations the McDonnell administration made to the General Assembly during fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012. The total surplus for three those years came to $1.4 billion.\n\nBlair also cited administration figures for the amount of the surplus each year that went to transportation: $32.7 million in 2010; $67.2 million in 2011 surplus and $0 in 2012 surplus. That comes to a total of $99.9 million in surpluses that went to the state\u2019s Transportation Trust Fund.\n\nBlair acknowledged those figures mean that the amount that went to transportation is not less than 1 percent, as Norquist said. Less than 1 percent would mean less than $14 million of surplus went to transportation over the last three years.\n\n\"Initial information provided by members of the state legislature was incorrect. The actual amount spent on transportation projects is $99.9 million, roughly 7 percent of surplus funds,\" Blair wrote in an e-mail. \"The facts remain: when presented with the opportunity to designate more money to the Transportation Trust Fund from annual surpluses, the legislature generally designates the money to any and everything else.\"\n\nBlair declined to identify the legislators who he said provided the wrong information. He said 7 percent is still a low number, adding that a 2007 state law calls for ensuring that 67 percent of \"undesignated\" surpluses are required to go to transportation.\n\n\"To circumvent state law on the amount of money required to go to transportation from a surplus, the legislature ensures that the 67 percent of \u2018remaining funds\u2019 is very little,\" Blair said. \"In 2012, it was a whopping $0.\"\n\nWe spoke with Neil Miller, Virginia\u2019s deputy finance secretary, who confirmed $99.9 million has gone to the Transportation Trust Fund from the 2010 and 2011 surpluses and no money at all went there from the 2012 surplus.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the sum -- $61.7 million -- was earmarked for the Virginia Transportation Infrastructure Bank, a state program that lends money to localities and private entities to help pay for road, rail, and other transportation projects.\n\nAbout half of the three-year $1.4 billion surplus that McDonnell announced in August comes from revenues that exceeded estimates. Most of the rest comes from allocated money that was not spent.\n\nMiller explained in an e-mail that various state laws mandate where much of the state surplus money has to go.\n\nFor example the state\u2019s constitution requires that a portion of the surplus be deposited in the rainy day fund, used to cushion Virginia through lean budget cycles. The fund was drawn down during the Great Recession and received a combined $211 million from the 2011 and 2012 surpluses.\n\nVirginia law also requires a portion goes to the state\u2019s water quality improvement fund, which got $103.7 million of surplus money over the last three fiscal years. Another $47.7 million went into a reserve fund for disaster relief. The General Assembly often adds to the list by approving budgets that allocate in advance portions of surpluses that might occur for other priorities, such as a bonus paid to state employees last December.\n\nThere have been proposals over the years to boost the portion of surpluses that are funneled to transportation. In 2007, Republican\u2019s unsuccessfully sought to reserve half of all future budget surpluses for road maintenance.\n\nDemocrats have opposed the efforts. One reason is that the surplus comes from the state\u2019s general fund, which draws largely from income and sales taxes to pay for education, public safety and health programs. Transportation is primarily funded by a different set of revenues: federal grants and state taxes on gasoline, vehicle sales and licenses. Many Democrats have insisted that surpluses should be returned to general fund programs.\n\nDemocrats and some senate Republicans also have noted that the state does not always end its fiscal year in surplus, and argued that Virginia needs a long-term, dependable source of new revenues to solve its transportation problems.\n\nA final note: The major parts of McDonnell\u2019s transportation plan have been approved by the House. The Senate has passed a more ambitious plan that would generate $900 million a year by increasing the gas tax and pegging it to inflation, raising vehicle registration fees and empowering localities to impose a local sales tax for transportation projects.\n\nHouse and Senate negotiators are trying to reach a compromise before the General Assembly\u2019s scheduled adjournment on Feb. 23.\n\nOur ruling\n\nNorquist said the state legislature spent less than 1 percent of its surplus over the last three years on roads.\n\nHis organization acknowledges that number is wrong. The correct figure is 7 percent, a difference equaling at least $86 million"}
{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Mitt Romney \"Under the president's plan, he cuts Medicare by $716 billion, takes that money out of the Medicare trust fund and uses it to pay for Obamacare.\"", "evidence": "Florida has become the battleground where Mitt Romney and Barack Obama are dueling over Medicare.\n\nRomney\u2019s favorite attack line: Obama took $716 billion from Medicare to pay for Obamacare.\n\nRomney made the claim in an Aug. 15, 2012, one-on-one interview with Tampa Bay\u2019s WTSP 10 News.\n\n\"Under the president's plan, he cuts Medicare by $716 billion, takes that money out of the Medicare trust fund and uses it to pay for Obamacare,\" Romney said. \"I think this is something that people are just now focused on and find it very, very difficult to understand why he would cut Medicare for our current seniors.\"\n\nRomney\u2019s been repeating that number a lot lately. Is it accurate? And was the money moved to pay for the national health care law?\n\nNeither Obama nor his health care law literally cut funding from the Medicare program\u2019s budget. Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to try to bring down future health care costs in the program.\n\nWhat kind of spending reductions are we talking about? They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law made significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers.\n\nHospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care.\n\nObama and fellow Democrats say the intention is to protect beneficiaries' coverage while forcing health care providers to become more efficient. Romney has said he will repeal the health care law and institute a new overhaul of Medicare that brings more private insurers into a competitive marketplace. Beneficiaries would receive \"premium support,\" a voucher-like credit, to buy their own plan.\n\nWe should point out that the overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future, even with the health care law\u2019s cost-saving measures. The law tries to limit the program\u2019s growth, though, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget. So claims that Obama would \"cut\" Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate. In the past, we\u2019ve rated similar statements Half True or Mostly False, depending on the wording and context.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been following the Medicare debate for awhile, you may have heard previous claims that Obama cut Medicare by $500 billion. How did that become $700 billion? Because Medicare spending gets bigger every year, the cost-saving mechanisms in the health care law also get bigger. And, it takes a few years for the health care law\u2019s savings mechanisms to kick in. In fact, the effects of time are the main reason the $500 billion number has turned into $700 billion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe CBO determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. Ina more recent estimate released this year, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by $716 billion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSo it\u2019s timing that\u2019s making the cuts bigger, not changes to Medicare.\n\nRomney also send that the spending reduction \" takes that money out of the Medicare trust fund and uses it to pay for Obamacare.\"\n\nRomney has a point here, but it\u2019s not about money being moved from one account to another. Let us explain.\n\nAt the time the health care law was being finalized and passed, Democrats said it was important to them that the new law not add to the deficit. So the reductions in Medicare spending were counted against the health care law\u2019s new spending. Some new spending is within the Medicare program, such as increasing coverage for prescription drugs and offering preventive care with no out-of-pocket costs.\n\nMore significantly, though, the law moves to cover the uninsured, by giving them tax credits to buy private insurance. It also expands Medicaid, the state insurance program for the poor. The savings from Medicare offset that spending.\n\nWe should note that the health law also imposes new taxes, primarily on the wealthy and on the health care industry. That too offsets the new spending.\n\nOur ruling\n\nRomney said, \"Under the president's plan, he cuts Medicare by $716 billion, takes that money out of the Medicare trust fund and uses it to pay for Obamacare.\" This wording isn't as troublesome as other statements we've seen on this topic, including from Romney himself.\n\nStill, Romney's most-recent attempt at this claim needs significantly more explanation.\n\n"}

In light of the 2008 financial crisis and the ongoing recession, some might think that would be easy to achieve.But that's not the case, said Lawrence Summers, one of President Barack Obama's top economic advisers.\"I expect that reform is going to pass. It's not easy. You've got a million dollars being spent, per congressman, in lobbying expenses on this issue. (The) industry has four lobbyists per member of the House and Senate working on this,\" Summers said, when asked about the prospects for financial reform on ABC News' This Week.The new regulations are still being formulated. A bill in the Senate would create a council to watch for systemic threats to the financial system, and it would allow the Federal Reserve to oversee different types of financial institutions, not just banks.We wanted to check Summers' statements that a million dollars was being spent per congressman, and that there were four lobbyists for every member of the House and Senate working on it.To analyze his statements, we turned to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group that has spent 25 years tracking money in politics. Much of their work involves the analysis of mandated disclosure documents for campaign finance and lobbying.The most recent documents cover the year 2009; the filings for the first quarter of 2010 are due April 20. The center analyzed spending on lobbyists by sector, with finance, insurance and real estate grouped into one category. For 2009, that sector's spending totaled just over $455 million. There are 435 members of U.S. House of Representatives, so that is more than $1 million per member. One could make an argument that senators are also technically members of Congress, but Summers said \"congressmen,\" which typically means House members.Summers also said that the industry has four lobbyists per member of the House and Senate. The finance, insurance and real estate sector employed 2,597 lobbyists in 2009, according to the center. Add 100 senators to the 435 House members and you get 535; that's 4.85 lobbyists for every member of Congress.We must add a few cautions about these numbers. The insurance category includes a few health insurers, a group not likely to be lobbying on financial reform. Blue Cross/Blue Shield, for example, spent $14.3 million on lobbyists in 2009, and America's Health Insurance Plans spent $8.9 million. But other types of insurers would be interested in financial reform, because the legislation gives new authority to for the government to wind down failing companies that are not banks. Additionally, the financial sector lobbies on some issues that are not strictly related to financial regulations. The American Bankers Association, for example, used seven lobbyists in 2009 to influence a major appropriations bill, according to the center.Still, there's reason to think that the center's numbers come pretty close to the mark, said Dave Levinthal, a spokesman for the Center for Responsive Politics.\"As soon as the Obama administration came into office, it was evident that something was going to happen,\" he said. \"This was a major issue last year and continues to be a major issue this year.\"On taking office, Obama said one of his top priorities was new financial regulations, and legislators were working on them for much of 2009. The House of Representatives approved a bill on Dec. 11; the Senate has yet to vote on a bill.Though the financial sector faced significant setbacks during the crisis of fall 2008, the sector's spending on lobbying in 2009 kept pace with or exceeded spending in previous years, Levinthal said. Getting back to Summers' statement, he said, there is \"a million dollars being spent, per congressman, in lobbying expenses on this issue. (The) industry has four lobbyists per member of the House and Senate working on this.\" There may be cases in which the financial sector did not spend the entirety of its $455 million in lobbying money strictly on financial regulation during 2009, or examples when some of its 2,597 lobbyists did not work financial regulation. But it's clearly one of the industry's top issues. And the analysis here is based on public records and disclosures"}
{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Jim McDermott \"Most\" of the Bush tax cuts went to people \"in the top 3 percent of this country.\"", "evidence": "During an interview with MSNBC host Ed Schultz, Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., took aim at a series of tax cuts enacted by President George W. Bush -- tax cuts that backers say energized the economy but which critics assailed as a giveaway to the rich.\n\nSchultz and McDermott were discussing Republican opposition to extending unemployment benefits without reallocating money already included in the economic stimulus package passed in 2009. McDermott, like other Democrats, decried that rationale for\u00a0blocking unemployment insurance, saying that Republicans have consistently supported tax cuts that benefit richer Americans.\n\n\"Those tax cuts, most of it, went to people above -- at the very top, in the top 3 percent of this country, and they simply are unwilling to be even-handed,\" McDermott said. \"Treat the workers like you treat the rich in this country, but they don't. They give to the rich and take it away from the poor, and then cluck their fingers and say, we shouldn't give you an unemployment check because you might sit at home and wait for this little check and not go out and look for a job. You can't find a job today in most parts of this country. You've got six people looking for every job that's out there, and to put the blame on the workers is absolutely wrong.\"\n\nWe thought it was worth checking his claim that a majority of the benefits from the Bush tax cuts flowed to the richest 3 percent of Americans.\n\nTo do this, we looked at figures compiled by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. In one chart, the center compares how big a share different economic groups got from the series of tax cuts enacted under Bush between 2001 and 2008.\n\nThe center didn't look specifically at the top 3 percent, but it did look at the top 1 percent and the top 5 percent. The top 1 percent took 29.5 percent of the benefits, and the top 5 percent took 44.2 percent.\n\nSo if the top 5 percent took less than 50 percent of the benefits, the top 3 percent certainly didn't reach that 50 percent threshold. A rough estimate that splits the difference would be that the top 3 percent got 37 percent to 39 percent of the benefits.\n\n\"They did get a lot of the cuts, but not quite that much,\" said Bob Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.\n\nWhile McDermott's 3 percent figure is wrong, it's on the right track. While the tax cuts did benefit lower-income taxpayers as well, they benefited wealthier Americans disproportionately, based both on their share of the population and their share of income. In 2009, the top 1 percent earned 16 percent of cash income and the top 5 percent earned 29.5 percent of cash income.\n\nIndeed, if McDermott had simply refrained from citing the 3 percent figure, he would have been correct in saying that most of the Bush tax cuts went to \"people ... at the very top\" -- as long as you define the very top as the top 20 percent of earners. The top 20 percent took roughly two-thirds of the benefits from the tax cuts, according to the center's calculations.\n\nStill, McDermott did try to bolster a reasonable argument with an incorrect figure"}

Seven years is tomorrow. That's not acceptable.\"\nTrump is incorrect about the expiration date.\nThe deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, puts a cap on enriched uranium until 2030, or 12 years from now. After that, other agreements limit nuclear weapons development in Iran.\nA focus on fuel\nA full nuclear weapons program needs fuel for a bomb, a warhead, and a way to deliver the warhead, such as a missile or a plane.\n\"By far the most important and the most difficult step is producing the fuel,\" said Matthew Kroenig at Georgetown University\u2019s School of Foreign Service. \"That\u2019s why the Obama administration wanted to limit Iran\u2019s capacity to enrich uranium. And it\u2019s why it was so important to Iran to have the limits end after 15 years.\"\nUnder the deal, Iran gave up 97 percent of its stockpile of enriched uranium. It also lost 14,000 of its 20,000 centrifuges, the machines used to enrich uranium, and it agreed to only enrich uranium to a level unsuitable for weapons for 15 years.\nFor plutonium, the other possible fuel for a nuclear bomb, the agreement bans plutonium reactors for 15 years and stipulates that Iran must dismantle its current one.\nThe White House pointed to an Associated Press article about a confidential side agreement that, according to the article, allows Iran to \"install centrifuges up to five times as efficient as the 5,060 machines it is now restricted to using.\" That would kick in at Year 11, or 2026. The article warned that this could reduce the time needed to produce weapons-grade uranium after the deal expired.\nThe White House also noted a Brookings Institution summary that said that after 2025, Iran could \"test large numbers of, and conduct enrichment R&D with, advanced centrifuges,\" and get a space ready for running the most advanced centrifuge after 2030.\nSo starting seven years from now, Iran could begin developing and then using better centrifuges.\n\n"}

This time around, the health pundits have spent considerable time spelling out the differences between the two scary diseases.\nEbola, which has a low risk of spreading through the United States, is passed through direct contact with bodily fluids and not through the air.\nMeasles, which was eliminated from the United States in 2000 due to wide vaccination, is a very different virus, explained CNN senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen. Unlike Ebola, \"you don\u2019t need to be that close to someone or kiss someone or anything like that\" to pass it around.\n\"It\u2019s airborne,\" she told Anderson Cooper on Feb. 2. \"If someone is in a room that has measles and leaves and you walk in two hours later, you could get measles from that person.\"\nWe thought her example sounded alarming.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Iowa ranked 11th of the 50 states in February 2020 for unemployment, with a rate of 2.8 percent.\u00a0\nIowa\u2019s unemployment rate has seen historic lows recently as well. According to data from Iowa Workforce Development, the lowest nine months in the past 20 years for unemployment have been since 2018. The lowest unemployment rate over the past two decades was 1.9 percent in October 2018. The Iowa report for March is to be released April 17.\nAre Iowa employers \"scrambling\" to find workers?\nWe reached out to Whitver to ask what sources he was citing but he didn\u2019t respond. This claim often is made by business and political leaders in Iowa, however, so we did our own sourcing by checking with those who would know and existing data.\nMatthew Kodis, a data analyst at the Iowa Economic Development Authority, said in an interview economists generally define full unemployment as below 3 percent, which Iowa had been under since August 2017.\u00a0\nThe interview with Kodis was in February, as we were researching Iowa\u2019s unemployment history. Kodis also said then that companies were having trouble finding employees, as Whitver claimed. In a 2019 report Kodis developed for Iowa Economic Development Authority, nearly half of surveyed companies reported that there was a low availability of workforce in their area, and 74 percent said they were experiencing workforce recruitment problems.\u00a0\nThis hyper-competitive job market has led to slow growth for business hiring and overall state GDP compared to other states, Kodis said. One problem that arises is businesses aren\u2019t able to expand without a solid pool of potential employees.\u00a0\n\"Right now, we aren\u2019t necessarily seeing a negative impact on the economy, more so as we\u2019re seeing slower growth than some states that have higher unemployment rates,\" he said in that February interview.\nIn the same report, 46 percent of companies said they had plans to expand in the next three years, but 22.2 percent of those companies said expansions in Iowa may not be possible because of workforce shortages.\nHave wages gone up?\nThe scarcity of employees contributed to an increase in wages, Iowa Association of Business and Industry president Mike Ralston said in an interview.\u00a0\n\"Employers understand that they have to have competitive pay and benefits,\" he said. \"I wouldn\u2019t want to be an employer paying the lowest wage in an area, because I\u2019m not going to get the employees, that\u2019s for sure.\"\u00a0\n\n"}

They have voted the same way all but a handful of times since 2013. Broun, though, has been the most vocal of the three men against some GOP initiatives, usually arguing they are not conservative enough.\nSince 2013, Broun is the only Republican House member from Georgia who has voted with his party less than 95 percent of the time, according to the website Open Congress. Broun has voted along party lines 87 percent of the time. Gingrey and Kingston have both voted along party lines at a 95 percent clip.\nBroun directed us to a handful of votes among the more than 700 votes taken by the House since the beginning of 2013 to make his case.\nThrough spokesmen, both Gingrey and Kingston said Broun\u2019s claims were absurd. But this fact-check really got interesting when we interviewed another member of Congress who told us a story about a recent vote concerning Broun and Kingston.\nOn March 6, the House was preparing to vote on an aid package for Ukraine when Broun told his seatmate, U.S. Rep.

With one minute left, Broun followed through with his vote against the bill. As time expired, Massie\u00a0said he looked up at the electronic board tracking how each member voted and noticed that Kingston voted against the legislation, House Resolution 4152.\n\"Hey, look at the board!\" Massie\u00a0said.\n\"I told you so,\" Broun replied.\nMassie\u00a0said he decided to share his story about the March 6 vote with PolitiFact Georgia after Gingrey and Kingston said that Broun was wrong in his assertion.\n\"To say Paul Broun is misleading would be false,\" Massie\u00a0told us.\nBroun and Kingston did vote no, records show. Gingrey voted in favor of the legislation that day.\nVideo is not allowed of the electronic board that records the votes, so there is no way to see if Kingston first voted in favor of the legislation. Video of the vote tally is permitted, and it shows the Republican vote count changed as the time expired from 195 in favor of the bill and 21 against it to 194 to 22.

Multiple Democrats are also running in their own primary.\nThe ad was referring to votes DeSantis took on budget resolutions between 2013 and 2015.\nDeSantis did vote on nonbinding budget resolutions that called for raising the retirement age and slowing the rate at which future spending would grow.

David Cicilline was interviewed on WPRI's \"Newsmakers,\" which aired May 12, 2013.\n\nCicilline expressed support for one proposal that would eliminate the limit on the Social Security payroll tax. Currently, employees stop paying the 6.2-percent tax for the year once their income hits $113,700. Applying the tax to everyone regardless of their income would keep Social Security solvent for the next 75 years, according to the Office of the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration.\n\nOn \"Newsmakers,\" Cicilline said more and more income is now exempt from the tax.\n\n\"Social Security used to be a tax which was assessed on approximately 90 percent of the income generated in this country, which was where it has sort of been historically.

In fact, 83 percent is the average proportion of wages subjected to the tax from the founding of Social Security through 2009.

And there are going to be lots of ... We're going to have a lot of different options. Right now, you have no options. You know why? Because the insurance company controls (President Barack)\u00a0Obama, because they gave him a lot of money. That's why you have lines around the states. And you can't get competitive bidding.\"\nTrump was referring to the Republican idea of allowing insurance companies to sell in multiple states in one fell swoop, rather than through the state-by-state permitting process that happens today. Trump also believes in health savings accounts and some sort of program for the very poor.\nWhen NBC host Chuck Todd asked him about his view on mandates, Trump said no one would be forced to buy health insurance, unlike the law says today.\nBut we were struck by his statement that \"right now, you have no options.\"\nWe reached out to the Trump campaign to learn what he specifically meant and did not hear back. Trump\u2019s comments seemed misleading because a major part of the health care law\u00a0is set up to encourage competition and give people options.\nDoes the law achieve that? The short answer is, for most people it does. However, in more rural counties, residents might have to choose between only one or perhaps two insurance companies. Those people have few options.\nThe exchanges\nThe new health care law sets up exchanges or marketplaces, primarily online but also accessible through various government offices, where people can pick from roughly comparable insurance plans for which the main difference is price. The law puts each plan into one of four tiers -- bronze, silver, gold and platinum. The more generous, and costly, the plan, the higher the tier.\nThe government\u2019s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported that for 2016, about two-thirds of the counties have three or more insurers offering plans at the silver level. (This only has to do with plans on the exchanges, and primarily the exchange run by Washington. Employer-provided insurance is altogether separate.)\nA more detailed analysis for 2016 by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a research center widely seen as a source of objective data, found wide variation across the country. In Indiana, for example, residents in every county have at least\u00a0four carriers to choose from. In contrast, in Oklahoma, no county has more than two companies competing with each other.\n\n"}

He also notes that he \"served his country as an Army officer for over five years on active duty and was recognized for distinguished performance as the most outstanding second lieutenant commissioned in the US Army through the ROTC program nationally.\"\n\nThe most outstanding in the entire country?

But the public affairs officers at Fort Knox, where the documents are housed, said it kept only \"service records of soldiers who were in service in 2000 and later.\"\n\nThey forwarded our request to the Military Personnel Records Center, part of the National Archives and Records Administration in St. Louis. The wait time, they told us, would be at least three months unless the request came from the veteran himself.\n\nRobitaille agreed to file a request; the records finally arrived in the second week of October complete with a letter from the Records Center verifying their authenticity.\n\nThe\u00a0 answer was clear: Robitaille won the Ralph Mershon award for the 1969-1970 school year. The documentation proving his claim includes several letters from then-Secretary of the Army Stanley R. Resor. It reads:\n\n\"Robitaille attained the highest composite score of all distinguished military graduates who applied for and accepted a commission in the Regular Army.\"\n\nThat was 40 years ago, but Robitaille said he recalled that each university with an ROTC program nominated the student with the top combined score in academics, ROTC activities and a summer basic training camp. Robitaille got Providence College's nod and was selected as the top candidate from any school.\n\nHe said he learned of the award months later, in 1971, when his commander approached him in the officer's club in Germany to extend his congratulations. The way Robitaille remembers it, the commanding general of the 1st Armored Division presented him with the prize that night. The details are hazy, he said, but there was also a check for $400 which for a young soldier, seemed much more exciting than a plaque.\n\nA second letter from the secretary of the Army offers a bit more detail where Robitaille's memory leaves off. It orders the commanding general of the U.S. Army Europe and Seventh Army to present the award \"at an appropriate ceremony and that his personal congratulations be conveyed to Lieutenant Robitaille for his achievements along with best wishes for his continued to success.\"\n\nWe give this one a definite True and offer our own congratulations.

The majority of states have\u00a0some type of voter IDrequirement, and the trend over recent years has been more strict procedures.\n\"Across all states there are some additional hurdles women have to jump over if they get married and change their name,\" said Tammy Patrick, an elections expert at the Democracy Fund. \"It\u2019s just a question of how easy that transition is and how many hurdles.\"\nFor transgender women, the research we found estimates the number of adults who lack IDs that reflect their current name or gender \u2014 not how many were blocked from voting as a result.\u00a0\nBrennan Center found many women lack document with current legal name\nThe White House pointed to a 2006 telephone\u00a0survey\u00a0of 987 voting-age citizens conducted for the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School, one of the top national advocates for expanding voting rights. The survey asked voters questions about their IDs, such as if their photo ID had their current name, as opposed to their maiden name.\nThe Brennan Center found that 66% of voting-age women with ready access to any proof of citizenship had a document with their current legal name. (The survey didn\u2019t ask women if they were prevented from voting as a result of lacking an ID with their current name.)\nThe Brennan Center has not repeated that survey since 2006, but it did point to more recent examples of women who changed their names and were flagged at the polls as a result of voter ID rules.\u00a0\u00a0\nA TV station reported in 2013 that a Texas district judge,\u00a0Sandra Watts, had to sign an affidavit affirming her identity after a poll official noticed that she had one name shown as her middle name on her driver\u2019s license and a different middle name on her voter registration card. One of the middle names was her maiden name.\u00a0\n\"What I have used for voter registration and identification for the last 52 years was not sufficient yesterday when I went to vote,\"\u00a0Watts said.\u00a0\nWatts told PolitiFact: \"My legal name is Sandra Lee Watts; however, when I married in 1964, Texas automatically changed the name on my driver\u2019s license using my maiden name as my middle name. Since 1964, my driver\u2019s license reflects the name of Sandra Mathison Watts.\u00a0 That name was not identical to my name on my voter registration and that presented a problem at the time I went to vote.\"\u00a0\nWendy Davis, a Texas state senator and candidate for governor in 2013, also had to sign an affidavit because her driver\u2019s license included her maiden name while her registration record did not. Davis had authored the amendment to give voters the affidavit option if their names were substantially similar.\nBut women were not the only ones who were directed to sign an affidavit.\u00a0Greg Abbott, then the Texas attorney general and now governor, also signed an affidavit in 2013 when he voted, because his driver\u2019s license showed that his name was Gregory Wayne Abbott while on voter rolls he was listed as Greg Abbott.\nWhat state laws say about name changes\nSome states have a more efficient process than others for name changes, said Amber McReynolds, founding CEO of the National Vote at Home Institute & Coalition.\nThe process can be relatively smooth for automatic voter registration states \u2014 places where citizens can register to vote while getting their driver's license. In other states, voters need to take separate steps to update their voter registration.\u00a0\nSome voters may face a time crunch to update their records if they get married close to Election Day.\n\n"}

Barbara Comstock says five U-turning Democrats ran over her bicycle safety bill in the state Senate last month.\nComstock, who represents Fairfax County and is running for the 10th District congressional seat being vacated by Republican Frank Wolf, complained on her campaign\u2019s Facebook page.\n\"Democrat senators were for my bipartisan \u2018following too closely\u2019 bicycle bill (HB 82) before they were against it!\" she wrote on Feb. 21. \"It was the same bill that Democrat senators voted for last year but this year, after I got it through the House (unlike the previous House patron) the senate killed it! Welcome to the new Democrat-controlled Virginia Senate.\"\nComstock was referring to the Senate Transportation Committee\u2019s 9-5 vote on Feb. 19 to kill her bill that would have made it illegal for a motorist to tailgate a bicycle.\nTwo of Comstock\u2019s political supporters posted Facebook replies accusing the Democrats of switching to undermine Comstock in her congressional race. A third supporter urged to her reveal the flip floppers.\nSo Comstock posted the names of five Democrats: Sens. Creigh Deeds of Bath County, Henry Marsh of Richmond, Ken Alexander of Norfolk, Phil Puckett of Russell County and John Miller of Newport News.\nRecords show that each of the five did vote to kill the bill. So we looked into Comstock\u2019s claim each changed his previous position.\nComstock\u2019s one-paragraph bill would have barred motorists from following bicycles \"more closely than is reasonable and prudent.\" In recent years, bills with the same language have passed the House and Senate, but they\u2019ve never been able to muster a majority vote from both chambers during the same year and make it to the governor\u2019s desk.\nLast year, the Senate passed an anti-tailgating bill containing an additional provision that would have extended the 2-foot width motorists must allow when passing bicyclists to 3 feet. Deeds, Alexander, Puckett and Miller supported the legislation. Marsh voted against the measure.\nMarsh, however, did support legislation in 2012 that solely contained the tailgating provision. So did Deeds, Puckett and Miller. Alexander was not in the Senate that year and did not cast a ballot on the bill.\nWe asked the Democrats why they changed their votes this year.\n\n"}

He then dismissed the concerns of a reporter who asked Trump whether he would be releasing his tax returns to prove it.\n\"I\u2019m not releasing the tax returns because, as you know, they\u2019re under audit,\" Trump said. The reporter pointed out that presidents have been releasing their returns since the 1970s. Trump interrupted her and said, \"Oh, gee, I never heard that.\"\n\"You know, the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters, okay? They\u2019re the only ones,\" he said, saying he thought the American public isn\u2019t concerned about it. \"I won; I mean, I became president. No, I don\u2019t think they care at all. I don\u2019t think they care at all. I think you care.\"\nMedia outlets have called for Trump to release his returns throughout his campaign, and have increased calls since his election. Trump and his surrogates have offered myriad excuses as to why he won\u2019t release any information. But are they the only people who care whether he does it?\nPolling data consistently shows that overall, a majority of Americans want to know what\u2019s in Trump\u2019s tax records.\nThe vocal majority\nIt\u2019s been common practice for decades for presidential candidates to release their tax returns. Despite Trump\u2019s argument that he isn\u2019t releasing his because he\u2019s being audited, the IRS has said he\u2019s allowed to release them whether he\u2019s under an audit or not (as Richard Nixon did).\nTax returns show a lot of details about a president\u2019s business dealings and financial background, much more than, say, campaign finance disclosures, which Trump has offered as an alternative. That explains the media interest, which Trump has attacked before.\nTrump\u2019s transition team did not elaborate on his statement when we contacted them, but he is wrong to say that the public doesn\u2019t care, by most polls.\nOne such poll taken before Trump's news conference confirms most Americans said he should release the returns.\u00a0\n\n"}
{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Kathleen Sebelius \"One of three patients hospitalized (is) harmed by the care they receive.\"", "evidence": "It\u2019s no secret that health care costs are rising, but comments by a White House Cabinet member about the quality of care surprised us.\n\nU.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said at a recent Atlanta Press Club luncheon that \"one of three patients hospitalized (is) harmed by the care they receive.\"\n\nSebelius made the claim while discussing the need to provide better health care under the federal government\u2019s Medicare program. The White House has begun a program to reduce preventable medical errors.\n\nThe secretary attempted to drive home the seriousness of the issue by telling the story of a Stone Mountain woman who got an infection during ankle surgery. The woman, Sebelius said, needed another surgery to remove screws previously put in her ankle. She had to take antibiotics at home, needed weekly visits from a home health nurse and additional treatment from a doctor to make sure the infection went away.\n\nSebelius said such tales are not rare. Still, we wondered about the frequency. Is it really one of three?\n\nThe secretary\u2019s office said her claim came from a recent study in the journal Health Affairs. The study\u2019s headline said that adverse effects from medical care in hospitals may be 10 times greater than previously believed.\n\n\"Overall, adverse events occurred in 33.2 percent of hospital admissions,\" the nine-page study said.\n\nSeveral newspapers reported the findings.\n\n\"[Medical errors] are a big issue,\" said Dr. Peter Pronovost, director of the Johns Hopkins University Quality and Research Safety Group, who has received praise for his research on the topic.\n\nBut is the statistic that Sebelius quoted correct?\n\nDoctors and medical experts began paying more attention to medical errors during care after a landmark 1999 study by the Institute of Health, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences. Researchers concluded that as many as 98,000 Americans die each year as a result of medical errors.\n\nIn November, a team of doctors released its findings on five years worth of medical records from 10 randomly selected hospitals in North Carolina between 2002 and 2007. They chose that state because it has worked hard to improve patient safety in recent years. The research found \"25.1 patient harms per 100 admissions.\" Nearly one out of five patients had an adverse effect from medical care, the study found. The greatest percentage of harms came from medical procedures. Medications were a close second. Infections were third on the list.\n\nDr. Christopher Landrigan, the lead author of the North Carolina study, said the adverse effect from medicine could range from a condition that requires a hospital stay to something as simple as a rash. Landrigan, associate professor of medicine and pediatrics at Harvard Medical Center, said medical errors occur because care and treatment are imperfect.\n\n\"The root cause of it is medicine is very complicated,\" Landrigan said, explaining why medical errors are so alarmingly high. \"There is a high risk of something going wrong.\"\n\nThe April report that Sebelius referenced focused on three hospitals of different sizes located in different parts of the United States. The researchers, led by Dr. David C. Classen, randomly selected patients from all adult age groups admitted to those hospitals during the month of October 2004 and reviewed the records of 795 patients.\n\nThe largest forms of problems, nearly 40 percent of them, were related to medicine given for a surgery or procedure. The second-leading cause, nearly 30 percent, was procedure-related. Infections were the third-leading cause, the study found. About one third of the problems required a longer hospital stay. Nearly 8 percent resulted in permanent patient harm, a lifesaving procedure or death.\n\nLandrigan said he didn\u2019t dispute the research in the Health Affairs report. He said Classen and his fellow researchers were more experienced in using some of the tools now used to detect medical errors. Classen and his team did use a broader definition of adverse events than in other studies, saying they did not restrict themselves to whether they were preventable or led to a major disability.\n\n\"Fundamentally, the methodology was very sound,\" Landrigan said.\n\nTo date, other reviews of the study have been well-received.\n\n\"This is one of the best studies that now gives us a sense of how much harm is happening to patients in American hospitals,\" Dr. Robert Wachter, chief of medical service at the University of California, San Francisco, Medical Center, told American Medical News.\n\nWachter was not involved in the research.\n\nTo sum up, Sebelius repeated information from a report that falls in line with other research showing that the problem of medical errors is progressively getting worse. Although the report has not been disputed, there are a few caveats, such as the researchers used a broader definition of adverse events, some of the effects were not life-threatening and the short length of the research of the study"}
{"label": "false", "claim": "Herman Cain The 9-9-9 plan \"does not raise taxes on those that are making the least.\"", "evidence": "Herman Cain has offered what he calls a simple tax plan to take the place of the current tax code, which he says is too complicated. Cain, a Republican candidate for president, touts a 9-9-9 plan: a 9 percent income tax, a 9 percent sales tax and a 9 percent business tax.\n\nCain\u2019s plan has gotten more attention in recent days -- and more criticism.\n\nAt the debate for the Republican nomination in Las Vegas on Oct. 18, 2011, moderator Anderson Cooper of CNN summarized those concerns. \"Mr. Cain, a lot of prominent conservatives now are coming forward saying that your 9-9-9 plan would actually raise taxes on middle-class voters, on lower-income voters,\" Cooper said.\n\n\"The thing that I would encourage people to do before they engage in this knee-jerk reaction is read our analysis. It is available at HerrmanCain.com,\" Cain said. \"It was performed by Fiscal Associates. And all of the claims that are made against it, it is a jobs plan, it is revenue-neutral, it does not raise taxes on those that are making the least. All of those are simply not true.\"\n\nHere, we wanted to check Cain\u2019s answer to Cooper\u2019s question, that the plan \"does not raise taxes on those that are making the least.\"\n\nWe\u2019ve been looking at\u00a0Cain\u2019s\u00a0plan\u00a0as part of our ongoing work fact-checking the Republican nomination contest. Based on what Cain and his campaign have said about the plan, the only exemptions on the income tax will be for charitable deductions and for undefined \"empowerment\" zones that would encourage development in inner cities. The 9 percent sales tax would apply to all new goods but not to used goods. Payroll taxes on workers would go away.\u00a0\n\nIf you pay no income tax currently -- and about half\u00a0the country doesn\u2019t -- Cain\u2019s plan means you would pay more income tax. \u00a0\n\nThe day of the debate, a new analysis was published examining Cain\u2019s tax plan. The analysis was published by the Tax Policy Center, an independent policy analysis group that includes tax analysts who have worked in both Democratic and Republican administrations.\n\nThe Tax Policy Center analyzed Cain\u2019s plan using the same type of models it has used to examine other national tax proposals.\n\nThe analysis found that Cain\u2019s tax plan would result in tax cuts for many of the wealthiest tax payers and tax increases for the poorest tax payers.\n\nThe center found that 83.8 percent of tax filers would get a tax increase under Cain\u2019s plan, compared with current tax policy.\n\nOn the other hand, most of the tax filers who make more than $1 million would get a tax cut under the Cain plan, about 95.4 percent of this high income group. And the average tax cut for millionaires would be $487,300.\n\nThe center also offered analysis of Cain\u2019s plan by income level compared with current tax policy. Most people earning lower incomes would see a tax increase.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash income\n\nPercentage of filers with a tax increase\n\n\n\nLess than $10,000\n\n84.1\n\n\n\n$10,000 to $20,000\n\n97.8\n\n\n\n$20,000 to $30,000\n\n97.3\n\n\n\n$30,000 to $40,000\n\n94.9\n\n\n\n$40,000 to $50,000\n\n92.1\n\n\n\n$50,000 to $75,000\n\n83.7\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe should note that the Tax Policy Center said it had to make a few assumptions about Cain\u2019s plan in order to analyze the plan according to its standard economic model. So it\u2019s possible Cain may release more details that could cause these estimates to change.\n\n"}
{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Rick Scott \"Estimates say individuals who escaped these high tax states have taken with them around $2 trillion in adjusted gross income.\"", "evidence": "Rick Scott began his second term as Florida\u2019s governor in much the same fashion as he started his first -- by railing against high taxes.\nIn his inaugural address on Jan. 6, 2015, Scott boasted that scads of people had moved to Florida in recent years, allegedly lured by the state\u2019s lack of income tax and low cost of living.\n\"Over the last 20 years, millions of people have escaped from states with climbing tax rates to move to states with lower taxes,\" Scott said. \"For starters, estimates say individuals who escaped these high tax states have taken with them around $2 trillion of adjusted gross income. They\u2019re voting with their feet.\"\nScott went on to point out that between 1992 to 2011, New York and Illinois had lost billions in adjusted gross income, and that \"their No. 1 destination was Florida.\" The Sunshine State, meanwhile, had \"inherited\" more than $100 billion in adjusted gross income from other states in the same time period.\nConsidering Florida just last year passed New York as the third-most populous state in the union, it\u2019s obvious people are moving into the state. We wondered about the larger point here, whether $2 trillion in adjusted gross income transferred into Florida and other states to avoid higher taxes.\nFeet not really voting\nScott\u2019s office told us the estimate came from author and tax wonk Travis H. Brown\u2019s book How Money Walks: How $2 Trillion Moved Between the States, and Why It Matters, which touts adjusted gross income movement as proof that states with high taxes persistently lose population and money to low-tax states.\nBrown\u2019s publicist did not respond to our request for comment, so we couldn\u2019t ask him specifics about his theory. His essential argument, according to his book, is that \"it appears that there is a direct correlation between state personal income tax rates and income\u00a0migration. Money is walking, and we can see exactly where it\u2019s going.\"\nBrown combined Internal Revenue Service and Census data of the adjusted gross income (defined as all the money a person makes minus adjustments) of people who moved between states in a 15-year period between 1995 and 2010, using available records. He argued these stats show how these migrations affected states, including Florida, which is the largest net income beneficiary using this point of view, to the tune of $86.4 billion over 15 years, according to Brown.\nSimilar conclusions about taxpayer migration have been drawn by the business-backed Tax Foundation and the New York-based Empire Center. The argument has become a popular anti-tax talking point, just as Scott used it.\nWe ran Brown\u2019s methodology by a number of experts, and we didn\u2019t find many economists who know of Brown\u2019s work well enough to comment on it. Brown identifies himself as a \"political consultant and legislative lobbyist by trade\" in his book. Cristobal Young, a Stanford sociologist who has co-authored studies on millionaire migration in New Jersey and California that found tax rates had little impact on migration, said he was familiar with Brown\u2019s book and website but paid little attention to them because Brown\u2019s conclusions are \"not an academic or scientific work.\"\nOne economist who did critique Brown was Michael Mazerov of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\nMazerov said that it\u2019s not clear from Brown\u2019s book whether the $2 trillion number is meant to represent all the money moving out of high tax states into low tax states, or whether it\u2019s simply the sum of all adjusted gross income moving across states, i.e. all the money that didn\u2019t stay in the same state over a 15-year period.\nThat\u2019s a critical distinction, and we found contradictory wording in the book on that point. We tried to reach Travis to clear up this point, but we didn\u2019t hear back. We\u2019ll update this fact-check if we do.\n\n"}

Ron DeSantis, a Republican who refused to order mask wearing and, in September 2020, generally lifted all restrictions.\nSnyder, during a March 12 radio interview on WRVA in Richmond, recalled how DeSantis was criticized in spring 2020 for taking a reckless approach to COVID.\n\"Nearly a year later, there is no discernible difference between the spread and deaths of COVID in Virginia than there is in Florida,\" Snyder said, adding that Virginia\u2019s economy \"is in the tank\" because of Northam\u2019s \"horrendous\" policies.\nWe fact-checked Snyder\u2019s statement that there\u2019s \"no discernible difference\" between the two states in COVID spread and deaths - a claim he also made during a Feb. 25 radio interview on WCHV in Charlottesville.\u00a0\nSnyder\u2019s campaign said his information came from the \"COVID Data Tracker\" kept by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Our review of the data, however, found Florida has had significantly higher COVID case and death rates than Virginia since spring 2020.\nBecause Snyder used the time frame of \"nearly a year,\" we compared the states from the starting point of the CDC\u2019s data on April 1, 2020 to the date of Snyder\u2019s WRVA claim on March 12, 2021. During that span, Florida had 8,994 COVID cases per 100,000 people, and Virginia had 6,954 cases per 100,000. Florida\u2019s per capita caseload was 29% higher than Virginia\u2019s.\u00a0\nDuring the same span, Florida saw 150 deaths per 100,000 people, compared 117 per 100,000 in Virginia. Florida\u2019s death rate was 28% higher than Virginia\u2019s.\u00a0\nPut another way, Virginia had 593,562 COVID cases during the time span. Florida\u2019s per capita rate would have meant an additional 173,900 cases in Virginia. Virginia had totaled 9,985 COVID deaths when Snyder made his WRVA statement. Florida\u2019s per capita rate would have meant an additional 2,820 deaths in Virginia.\u00a0\nSo, contrary to Snyder\u2019s claim, Florida has seen discernibly higher COVID case and death rates than Virginia during the last 12 months.\u00a0\nOn the day of Snyder\u2019s statement, Virginia had the 9th lowest cumulative per capita case rate; Florida ranked 22nd among states. Virginia had the 13th lowest COVID death rate; Florida ranked 24th.\nThe only change to the rankings if we carry them out to this writing on March 29 is that Virginia has moved up one spot, to 8th, in per capita deaths.\u00a0\n\n"}

Over the past 2-3 years Texas has tripled our dependence on wind energy to 23-25 percent of our energy distribution system.\"\nThose figures appeared high at first glance, but we wanted to check with experts. Here\u2019s what we found.\nTaxpayer subsidies\nWind energy generators have received subsidies on the federal, state and local levels, as have other types of generators. West claimed that the state has given out $19 billion since 2006. The party\u2019s spokesman Luke Twombly did not respond to multiple requests for an explanation of the number\u2019s source.\nCarey King, research scientist at the University of Texas and assistant director at the university\u2019s Energy Institute, who wrote a paper on state energy subsidies, said he could not see how West was coming up with that figure.\nThe 2018 white paper that King co-authored looked at state-sponsored subsidies for various types of electricity generation.\nThe paper found that renewables do receive a lot more financial help than conventional technologies. Wind receives between $16 to $30 per megawatt-hour while conventional power sources receive\u00a0up to $2 a megawatt-hour.\nThe wind number is so high because it includes the cost of $7 billion Competitive Renewable Energy Zone transmission lines, a ratepayer-funded project that helps bring power from West Texas wind and solar generators to large Texas cities hundreds of miles away.\nBecause the transmission line project is not a traditional subsidy and there is debate over whether it should be counted as such, the researchers opted to calculate state subsidies with and without it.\nOne argument for excluding it is that subsidies are usually meant to incentivize investment; however, in the case of the Competitive Renewable Energy Zone lines, consumers, not generators, are paying for an investment, the paper points out.\nIt adds that the wind farm developers aren\u2019t the ones benefiting from cost savings here, but rather transmission and distribution utilities.\nKing added that the lines, which are also hooked up to traditional energy generation units, transmit more than just electricity produced by renewable generators.\nIf that project is removed from the calculation, researchers found that wind receives a comparable amount to other generators with $2 to $3 per megawatt-hour.\n\n"}

Overall, demand has exceeded supply since 1965, especially from Mexico, whose 1.3 million applicants on the waiting list made up 30 percent of the list as of November 2012.\n\nAll told, more than 4.4 million people are \"in line\" for immigrant visas, though an unknown number of those people may already be here without authorization.\n\nThere are also per-country caps in place. That has meant especially long waiting times not only in Mexico, but in China, India and the Philippines.\n\nSensenbrenner\u2019s claim\n\nIt is the case, for some categories of aspiring Americans from a few countries where hundreds of thousands want to settle here, that wait times just to get in are 20 years or more. Then it\u2019s another 3 to 5 years to obtain citizenship.\n\nMexican nationals who are the adult children of U.S. citizens experience waits of 20 years before they can file for permanent-residence visas commonly known as green cards, Bergeron wrote in a March 2013 immigration primer for the institute.\n\nThe same waits apply to Mexicans who are the adult unmarried children of lawful permanent residents of the United States.\n\n\"The longest backlog -- for siblings of U.S. citizens coming from the Philippines -- is currently about 24 years,\" Sumption told us. \"That means that people currently getting these green cards have waited 24 years for them.\"\n\nSo for a large number of people from countries where interest in living in the United States is high, Sensenbrenner is right that waits of \"up to\" 25 years are a reality.\n\n"}

Bush's Cabinet in 2001 and later going to work for a Washington legal and lobbying firm.\n\nThe Madison city clerk was not able to provide us a list of all elections that Thompson could have voted in.

Both sets of records date back to the fall 2002 primary elections and they are identical, in terms of which elections Thompson voted in.\n\nThompson campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir pointed out to us that the state board says its database for records from 2005 and earlier may not be complete.

The April ballot also included statewide referendum on the right to hunt and fish.\n\n2005: February primary -- state schools superintendent; April general -- schools superintendent and Dane County circuit judge. Also on the April ballot was a statewide referendum on four-year terms for certain county offices.\n\n2006: February spring primary -- Madison Metropolitan School Board, Dane County Board of Supervisors; April spring general -- school board, Dane County circuit judge; November fall general -- governor (Democrat incumbent Jim Doyle defeated Republican Mark Green), U.S. senator (Democrat incumbent Herb Kohl defeating Republican Robert Lorge), state attorney general and others.\n\n2010: February spring primary -- state court of appeals judge; April general -- appeals judge, county supervisor.\n\n2012: May recall primary -- Gov. Scott Walker was opposed by protest candidate Arthur Kohl-Riggs.\n\nSo, the records show that, since fall 2002, Thompson did not vote in 10 elections -- five primaries and five general elections in five different years.\n\nAsked to respond, Nemoir said in an email that Thompson \"makes all efforts to vote and the results provided by the (city) clerk do not take into consideration what was actually on the ballot in terms of contested elections and seemingly fail to represent his participation in the electoral process.\"\n\nBut he offered no evidence of any inaccuracies in Thompson\u2019s voting record.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 15, 2018\n\n\nWe wondered: Does the United States have a trade deficit with Canada? And does the United States have a trade deficit with \"almost all countries\"? We found that Trump\u2019s statement was somewhere between incomplete and misleading.\nDoes the United States have a trade deficit with Canada?\nTrump seems to be referring to a deficit in goods, which tells only part of the picture. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry.)\nIn 2017, the United States had a $23.2 billion deficit with Canada in goods. In other words, the United States in 2017 bought more goods from the Canada than Canada bought from the United States.\nHowever, the United States had a $25.9 billion surplus with Canada in services \u2014 and that was enough to overcome that deficit and turn the overall balance of trade into a $2.8 billion surplus for the United States in 2017. The same pattern occurred in 2016.\nThose unhappy with current trends in trade, such as Trump, tend to highlight the balance of trade in goods, since that subset of trade is the one that shows just how much manufacturing activity the United States has lost to foreign countries in recent years. By contrast, the United States has fared much better in services, which includes finance, insurance, legal services, business consulting and entertainment.\n\"Over the past 30 years, we have lost jobs in manufacturing, which produces goods, but gained a large number of very good jobs in service sectors and intellectual property,\" Matt Gold, an adjunct law professor at Fordham University, told PolitiFact in February. In services, by contrast, \"the U.S. dominates the world,\" Gold said.\nThere\u2019s a political connection here. Trump garnered significant support in the Rust Belt, which has been hit hard by trade deficits in goods, and he fared poorly in coastal and metropolitan areas that have benefited from the surge in services.\nIt\u2019s worth adding that a significant historical driver of the U.S. trade deficit in goods with Canada has been crude oil \u2014 a commodity that the United States has usually preferred to buy from Canada when possible, rather than from overseas suppliers that might be subject to greater political instability. It\u2019s also a product for which the United States is increasingly less reliant on foreign sources overall.\n\"After you take out oil products from Canada\u2019s exports to the U.S., the U.S. runs a massive trade surplus plus against Canada,\" to the tune of $49 billion in 2016, Daniel Trefler, a professor of economic analysis and policy at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management, told PolitiFact in February. \"If we are talking about manufacturing jobs, the U.S. is a huge winner.\"\nDoes the United States have a trade deficit with \"almost all countries\"?\nBy our calculations, this is incorrect.\nWe looked at the full list of countries and country equivalents that are tracked by the United States on trade balances to see whether the United States had a surplus or a deficit with them.\nWe found 129 countries or country equivalents with whom the United States had a surplus in 2017, out of 234 entities listed overall. This means that the United States had a surplus in 55 percent of those countries, or a majority.\nNotably, this data refers to goods only; if we had the data for both goods and services, the percentage might go even higher, given the United States\u2019 general advantage in services.\nWe did find at least six major trading partners with whom the United States had a surplus in 2017 in goods and services: Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and the United Kingdom. The United States also had a sizable surplus with the entire region of South and Central America.\nThat said, it\u2019s reasonable to point out that for the United States, the biggest trade deficits are larger than the biggest trade surpluses.\nHere\u2019s a rundown of the top 15 surpluses by country for 2017.

{"label": "false", "claim": "John Boehner The United States has seen \"a net loss of people with health insurance\" because of Obamacare.", "evidence": "For a law that will be judged, in part, by how many uninsured Americans gain coverage, it\u2019s a pretty bold statement when the most powerful Republican in Washington claims the Affordable Care Act is leading to more people without coverage.\nIn a press conference on March 13, 2014, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, claimed \"there are less people today with health insurance than there were before this law went into effect.\"\nA reporter later asked him if he really meant that. Boehner doubled down.\n\"I believe that to be the case,\" Boehner said. \"When you look at the 6 million Americans who've lost their policies, and (government officials) claim 4.2 million who've signed up \u2014 I don't know how many have actually paid for it \u2014 that would indicate to me a net loss of people with health insurance. And I actually do believe that to be the case.\"\nThere are a lot of holes in the administration\u2019s data for new signups. Further clouding the stats are fluctuations in the existing insurance market caused when insurance companies canceled plans that didn\u2019t meet Obamacare\u2019s coverage standards.\nBut to say that has resulted in a net loss is a stretch.\nThe Washington Post Fact Checker beat us to the punch on this. He gave Boehner\u2019s comment Four Pinocchios, his worst rating.\nWe have looked at similar claims before. We mostly heard it late last year, when several million Americans received notices from their insurance provider that their current policies would no longer be offered.\nSince it came from Boehner, though, we decided it was worth looking into again.\nPolls and projections\nWe took the issue first to Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck. He offered this explanation: \"The speaker explained the statement at the presser: More people have had plans canceled than signed up, especially when considering how inflated the enrollment numbers appear to be.\"\nBut that's not what Boehner said. He twice claimed that the number of people with insurance overall is down since the health care law went into effect, a considerably more audacious statement.\nWhile there isn't a final tally that looks at those numbers yet, Boehner's assertion goes against a recent Gallup poll, which said the number of uninsured Americans declined from 17.1 percent at the end of last year to 15.9 percent in the first quarter of 2014, the lowest level since 2008. Also, the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan policy scorekeeper, estimates over time that the percentage of insured Americans will rise as a result of the health care law.\nBoehner claimed the math, though, is simple. According to him, there were 6 million people told their policies were canceled because they didn't meet the health law's minimum benefits and coverage. And the administration announced that through February, 4.2 million had purchased insurance through the state and federal marketplaces. (A few days after Boehner spoke, the administration announced enrollment through the marketplace surpassed 5 million.)\nBy that logic, 1.8 million people must have lost insurance.\nBut Boehner misses a lot of important factors. We'll go through them one by one.\nWhat happened to canceled plans\nThere were many Americans notified that their insurance plans were canceled because they did not meet Obamacare's standards of coverage, despite promises that wouldn't happen. Boehner puts this at 6 million. It's a hard figure to pin down exactly.\nThrough an extensive reporting project, the Associated Press found at least 4.7 million Americans received notices about canceled policies; it could be higher.\nSome of those policies, about half, were restored when Obama administratively allowed canceled plans to continue for another year and later through 2016.\nMany others were moved to new plans, either through their insurance company or by purchasing a new policy on the marketplaces set up for Obamacare. The administration estimated that of the people with canceled plans, just 500,000 were left without coverage, and catastrophic coverage was extended to those individuals.\n\n"}

Say you're a U.S. oil company. You go to a foreign country to extract oil. You pay a 20 percent tax to that country on what you extract.

Vanity Fair published a list of things that \"could fit inside Mitt Romney\u2019s new house,\" including a Memphis-area Enterprise-Rent-A-Car facility,\u00a0Jennifer Aniston\u2019s old house and \"the world\u2019s largest whale.\"\n\nBut is the tale accurate?\n\nThere\u2019s a bit of disagreement over two issues -- the square footage involved, and whether the project is actually going\u00a0forward. We\u2019ll tackle those two issues individually.\n\nThe dimensions of the \"tear-down\" project\n\nThe home in question is located in La Jolla, Calif., an affluent oceanfront neighborhood adjoining San Diego, Calif. A recent article by the San Diego Union-Tribune makes the Romneys\u2019 immediate neighborhood sound positively dreamy. \"The area\u2019s winding lanes are lined with Tudor-style mansions, shingled California bungalows and cottages that could have been airlifted from the Cotswolds,\" the article said. (The Union-Tribune noted that Romney trails both President Barack Obama and the Democratic National Committee in donations from the 92037 ZIP code.)\n\nMitt Romney and his wife Ann bought their property, located on what is described as a quiet cul-de-sac, in 2008 for $12 million; two years later, it was assessed at $8.7 million. The Union-Tribune reported that it was built in 1936 and has three bedrooms and four-and-a-half baths. It has\u00a0a lawn that slopes down to a white sand beach.\n\nColumbia Journalism Review\u2019s \"The Audit\" blog\u00a0noted that the vast majority of the property\u2019s value stems from its location, rather than its structure: \"The county assessed the value of Romney\u2019s house at $8.7 million last year,\" The Audit reported. \"Eight million bucks of that value was in\u00a0the land and just $750,000 was in the 3,000 square-foot house and other improvements.\"\n\nWill Carless, a staff writer with the Voice of San Diego who lives nearby and often surfs in the vicinity, said the expanse of the Romneys\u2019 parcel is notable, with structures placed far enough back not to get hit by even the biggest swells. \"Half his yard is ice plant,\" he said,\u00a0referring to\u00a0a non-native species of flora. \"I\u2019ve often looked up and thought it was such big waste of space.\"\n\nApparently the Romneys did, too. The size of their family was also a factor. A campaign spokesman told the Chicago\u00a0Tribune that the reason for nearly quadrupling the size was to make room for visits by the couple's five married sons and 16 grandchildren.\n\nWhen the Union-Tribune initially reported the proposed renovation on Aug. 21, 2011, it cited a permit application Romney had filed with the City of San Diego to bulldoze the existing, 3,009-square-foot, single-story home and replace it with a new, two-story, 11,062-square-foot structure.\n\nThat\u2019s the source of the information used in the Winning Our Future video. But that description has been contested by Romney himself, in an interview with\u00a0New Hampshire Union Leader publisher Joseph W. McQuaid on Aug. 29, 2011.\n\n"}

But he got his job back after an arbitrator ruled he had been improperly fired. And that decision was upheld by two courts.\nThe Republicans contend, in effect, that even though the legal system returned the teacher to his job, Evers had the power to stop him from teaching at all -- anywhere in the state -- by revoking his teaching license.\nThey made essentially the same attack in a radio ad released Sept. 6, 2017.\nAs we\u2019ll see, this fact check turns largely on what state law said at the time about revoking a teacher\u2019s license for \"immoral behavior\" -- a law that was changed, in part, because of this case.\nThe governor\u2019s race\nRepublican Gov.

Dana Wachs of Eau Claire.\nThe case of Andy Harris\nThe Republican attack centers on Andy Harris, who started teaching in the Middleton-Cross Plains Area School District, west of Madison, in 1993. He had no disciplinary history before his December 2010 firing. At the time, Harris taught seventh-grade science at one of the district\u2019s two middle schools; now he has the same job at the other middle school.\nHere are the major events in the case, based on news reports, the arbitrator\u2019s decision and a state appeals court decision:\n\n\n\n\nDec. 2009\n\n\nSchool district announces Harris had been placed on leave because he received from his sister 23 emails containing pornography and other adult content. Many were jokes that showed images of nude or partially nude women, one of which Harris shared with a co-worker who complained to the principal. None were seen by students.\n\u00a0\nAn investigation by the school district finds that more than 30 teachers and administrators had accessed inappropriate jokes or sexually explicit materials on their school computers. Seven educators in addition to Harris were disciplined: five teachers received unpaid suspensions, one substitute teacher was dismissed and an administrator resigned.\n\n\n\n\nMay 2010\n\n\nSchool board fires Harris. The district notifies the state Department of Public Instruction, per a state law requiring school districts to report dismissals that are based on immoral conduct.\n\n\n\n\nFeb. 2012\n\n\nActing on a grievance filed by the teachers union, arbitrator Karen Mawhinney, a Burlington attorney, overturns Harris\u2019 firing and reduces his penalty to 15 days of unpaid suspension.\n\u00a0\nHarris\u2019 behavior did not meet the state law\u2019s definition of immoral conduct because \"there was no endangerment of the health, safety, welfare or education of any pupil,\" she wrote. She also said \"his worst offense is forwarding one inappropriate e-mail to two friends and not exercising the good judgment to discourage his sister from sending these types of e-mails to him.\" She added: \"The fact that he was discharged while others were suspended or received written reprimands or nothing at all, the discharge cannot stand.\"\n\n"}

In its 2008 ruling, the Supreme Court found that Washington\u2019s gun regulations \u2014 essentially amounting to a ban on handguns in the home \u2014 were unconstitutional.\nThis ruling was significant because it was the first time the court held that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual\u2019s right to own a firearm for self defense. Up until Heller, the widespread understanding of the Second Amendment was that the right to bear arms did not necessarily extend beyond militia service.\nBefore the case went to the Supreme Court, though, it appeared in the federal court of appeals for the D.C. circuit, where Garland has been a judge since 1997, as Parker vs. District of Columbia. In a 2-1 decision, a panel of three D.C.

She\u2019s now almost certain to succeed longtime Rep. Elliott Naishtat after the November election; no Republican filed to run.\nTo help Texas \"reverse course,\" as the mailer said, Hinojosa would focus on youth initiatives to keep young people out of the criminal justice system, her campaign director, Patti Everitt, told us by email. Hinojosa favors decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana, supporting youth jobs programs and backing educational reforms such as universal all-day pre-kindergarten.\nAnd was Hinojosa right that Texas has a higher incarceration rate than Russia or Iran?\nU.S. incarceration numbers\nAsked the basis of Hinojosa\u2019s comparison, Everitt said by email the campaign relied on a report by the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit that does research with the aim to \"expose the broader harm of mass criminalization,\" according to its website.\nThe cited report, \"States of Incarceration: A Global Context,\" includes a graphic showing incarceration rates by state alongside incarceration rates of many countries.\nTexas is listed with the fifth-highest incarceration rate, of 1,063 per 100,000 in population. Russia has the 44th-highest rate, at 475 per 100,000; Iran is listed with the 68th-highest, at 284.\nThen again, many states look bad in the report. Russia is only the third foreign nation on the list, behind Cuba and Rwanda. Otherwise, the 42 places with higher incarceration rates are U.S. states or the United States as a whole, partly a result of the nation\u2019s \"tough on crime\" policies of the 1980s and 1990s, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Louisiana is referred to as the \"the world\u2019s prison capital,\" with the highest incarceration rate of any country or U.S. state.\nThe Prison Policy Initiative drew the U.S. figures for correctional population counts from the 2010 U.S. Census, the group\u2019s director, Peter Wagner, told us by phone.\nAccording to the 2010 Census, Texas\u2019 total correctional population that year was 375,392. Of that number, 267,405 of the people counted lived in adult correctional facilities. Facilities included in that definition were federal detention centers, federal and state prisons, local jails, military disciplinary barracks and jails as well as correctional residential facilities, like halfway houses. The rest were spread among juvenile facilities, nursing facilities and an \"other\" category.\nAnother U.S. indicator\nBut the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, which tracks data like this, reports lower state-by-state incarceration rates. In 2014, it says, Texas imprisoned 600 people for every 100,000 residents, including minors, and 816 per every 100,000 adults.\nThat\u2019s because those numbers only include sentenced prisoners. They exclude prisoners who are unsentenced, prisoners serving less than one year, and local jail inmates. That limited definition, Wagner said, is why the Prison Policy Initiative turned to the 2010 Census to measure by correctional population count, getting 1,063 incarcerated per 100,000 people in Texas.\nUpshot: Hinojosa\u2019s source backs her up.\nA Texas skeptic\n\n"}

But a meme circulating this summer suggests otherwise.\nThe claim has been around in some form since 2002. One of the most recent versions, sourced from an anonymous blogpost on Raw For Beauty, says \"McDonald\u2019s hamburgers are only 15 percent \u2018real beef,\u2019 the other 85 percent is meat filler cleansed with ammonia, which causes stomach and intestinal cancer.\"\nWe wanted to know more about this \"meat filler,\" what place, if any, it has in McDonald\u2019s burgers, and if it is linked to cancer.\n\nBig Mac smack\nFirst, McDonald\u2019s says it no longer uses the \"meat filler\" in question.\nThis claim has been debunked numerous times since 2011, and it has also been addressed multiple times by McDonald\u2019s. In an FAQ about its meats, the fast food giant acknowledged that it once used \"pink slime\" -- or the industry preferred term, \"lean, finely textured beef\" -- in its products but has since stopped the practice:\n\"McDonald\u2019s USA had begun the process of removing it from our supply chain prior to widespread media coverage on its use and it was completely removed from our supply in 2011. While select lean beef trimmings are safe, we decided to stop using the product to align our global standards for beef around the world.\"\nAs for what exactly is in the patties, McDonald\u2019s writes, \"Our burgers in the US are made using only 100 percent USDA-inspected beef. There are no preservatives, no fillers, no extenders and no so-called \u2018pink slime\u2019 in our beef. The only thing added to our burgers is a bit of salt and pepper during grilling.\"\nThe \"pink slime\" rumor oozed its way to Down Under, too, forcing McDonald\u2019s Australia to release a video and tell a concerned customer, \"Rest assured, Dana, it\u2019s not true. Our beef patties are all 100 percent export quality Aussie beef, free of preservatives, additives, fillers and binders.\"\nDespite rising costs of beef, McDonald\u2019s has no plans to reintroduce lean, finely textured beef (the preferred industry term term for what critics call \"pink slime\"), said McDonald\u2019s spokeswoman Lisa McComb.\nPrimer on \"meat filler\"\nBut what exactly is lean, finely textured beef, and is it considered \"real beef\"?\nWhen Beef Products Inc., began making the product in 1991, the industry cheered it as revolutionary.\nEssentially, the goal is to get every piece of meat off of the bone, and then sanitize it so it is safe to eat. Here\u2019s how the process works:\nAbout 25 percent of the carcass remains after taking whole muscle cuts (sirloins, briskets, ribs, etc). The remaining fat trimmings with bits of meat still attached are then put through a heat and centrifuge process, which separates the fat and produces 93 to 97 percent lean meat, according to BPI.\nBecause the trimmings often are more susceptible to contamination, the meat is then treated with ammonium hydroxide gas to kill pathogens, like salmonella and E. coli. The U.S. Department of Agriculture does not require ammonium hydroxide to be included in the ingredients, considering it part of the process rather than part of the meat.\n\n"}

The reason? Year by year, federal revenues haven\u2019t been keeping up with spending, due to the struggling national economy (which has held back tax revenues) and a continuation of tax cuts. And each year there\u2019s an annual deficit, the national debt grows.\n\nThat led to the frequently cited -- and wrongly exaggerated -- claim that the debt has increased more under Obama than under all previous 43 presidents combined.\n\nIt also led to this blog posting by Rep.

Betty Sutton in Ohio's newly redrawn 16th congressional district:\n\n\"In less than one term, (Obama has) racked up more debt than any president in history \u2014 over $5 trillion.\"\n\nThe statement interested PolitiFact Ohio because it was less sweeping and more specific than\nmany others.\n\nResponding to our inquiry, Renacci's staff cited a CBS News story from March, which compared the debt growth under Obama's three years and two months in office to eight years under George W. Bush.\n\nOn Jan. 20, 2009, the date Obama took office, the debt stood at $10.6 trillion. At the time of the CBS story, it had increased by $4.9 trillion.\n\nBy \u00a0the day Renacci's statement was posted, the Treasury Department's online \"Debt to the Penny\" calculator showed the debt at more than $15.7 trillion -- an increase of $5.1 trillion.\n\nDuring the two terms of the Bush presidency, whose debt exceeded all predecessors, the debt rose $4.899 trillion.\n\nSo Renacci's numbers checked out.\u00a0\n\n"}

Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and asked why it included a major restructuring of Medicare but protected tax cuts for upper-income Americans.\n\n\"If that's on the table, then why shouldn't the burden be equally shared?\" Lauer asked. \"Why shouldn't we put some of that burden on the wealthy and corporations?\"\n\nBachmann responded, \"Well, remember, again, already the top 1 percent of income earners pay about 40 percent of all taxes into the federal government. So if you want to talk about fairness, the top 1 percent are paying 40 percent of all of the income.\"\n\nWe wondered whether she was right that \"the top 1 percent of income earners pay about 40 percent of all taxes into the federal government.\"\n\nThe most recent hard data on this question comes from the 2007 tax year. It can be found in a Congressional Budget Office report released in 2010. CBO\u2019s report shows what share of the federal tax liability was carried by various income groups.

She\u2019s even further off if you use an estimate for 2010 by the centrist to liberal Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, which pegs the share of all federal taxes for the top 1 percent at 22.7 percent.\n\nBachmann would have been right if she\u2019d said, \"the top 1 percent of income earners pay about 40 percent of all income taxes into the federal government.\" But she didn\u2019t say that -- and even if she had, her decision to focus on income taxes, rather than looking at the whole federal tax picture, would have presented the numbers in such a way that wealthier Americans would look more heavily taxed than they are.\n\nAs a general rule, the burden of the income tax is tilted heavily toward the upper end of the income spectrum. The payroll tax burden is also tilted toward the upper end, but the payroll tax differential for rich vs. non-rich \u00a0is not quite as great as it is for the income tax. For instance, the top 20 percent paid 86 percent of the income tax, but 42.9 percent of the payroll tax. Also, the Social Security portion of payroll tax applies only up to $106,800 in income. Meanwhile, the middle 20 percent of earners paid 4.6 percent of federal income taxes in 2007, but 16.6 percent of payroll taxes.\n\nSo for critics of taxes -- and Bachmann certainly is one -- it packs a greater wallop to cite income tax burdens for the wealthy than it does to cite their overall tax burden.

In this case, we wondered if Chafee\u2019s claim measures up.\nFalling short\nIn 1975, Former President Gerald Ford signed the Metric Conversion Act, which created the United States Metric Board, charged with leading the planning and educational efforts for switching over to the metric system. (Check out this delightful cartoon about converting to the metric system from 1975.)\nSo when Reagan took office in\u00a01981, a government-backed push for metric conversion -- also known as metrication -- was already well underway. However, the Metric Board had limited effectiveness in that there was no mandatory conversion timeline, and the board included some members who actually opposed conversion.\nIn 1982, Reagan effectively dismantled the metrication effort by stripping funding from the Metric Board. The group morphed into the Office of Metric Programs, under the Department of Commerce, with much less responsibility and less than a fifth of the budget.\nThat year\u2019s federal budget also cut a $2 million Department of Education program for metric education, according to the New York Times.\nThe Reagan administration justified the Metric Board cut as part of a general reduction in federal spending, rather than opposition to conversion -- preferring to leave conversion to the private sector. Reagan\u2019s budget proposal said, \"The board has accomplished its mission to familiarize the public with the metric system. Voluntary metrication will continue through market adjustments.''\nThe U.S. Metric Association, a current group dedicated to metric conversion, dug into this issue with Reagan Library materials.

It carried extra weight because Mitchell is head of the Wisconsin firefighter union.\n\nOn June 12, 2012, Romney claimed that President Barack Obama wants to add more government jobs and said the nation doesn\u2019t \"need more firemen, more policemen, more teachers.\"\n\nThe same day, the Wisconsin Democratic Party issued a news release in response, quoting Mitchell and a national Democratic Party spokesman.\n\nMitchell claimed in the release that Romney used a line-item veto to cut \"millions of dollars for firefighting equipment,\" including firefighters' \"coats, pants, helmets and boots.\"\n\nHis claim was similar to one made a day earlier by an Obama campaign official and another made days later by Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nIs Mitchell right?\n\nMitchell\u2019s evidence\n\nAsked for evidence, Mitchell referred us to Gillian Morris, spokeswoman for Obama's re-election campaign in Wisconsin.\n\nShe cited a July 2006 veto Romney issued for line item 8000-0050 in Massachusetts\u2019 2007 budget, his last during his single four-year term as governor.\n\nThe item, which was restored \u00a0by the legislature, provided for $2.5 million in grants to local fire departments for firefighting equipment that would \"include, but is not limited to, turnout gear.\"\n\nTurnout gear, said Edward Kelly, Mitchell\u2019s counterpart with the Massachusetts firefighters union, generally includes a firefighter\u2019s coat and pants.\n\nThat\u2019s also how turnout gear is described by the National Fire Protection Association.\n\nBut Kelly said turnout gear could also be interpreted to include a helmet and boots. And in any case, the line item allowed local governments to spend the grant money on any type of fire safety equipment.\n\nOther views\n\nFor context, we wondered whether Romney\u2019s veto was indicative of his treatment of fire departments and firefighters when he was governor.\n\nKelly said Romney cut aid to local governments, which resulted in cuts in fire department funding and led to firefighter layoffs.\n\nA February 2012 Boston Globe article also mentioned the aid cuts in recounting how, as governor, \"Romney fiercely protected a costly and controversial perk for police officers after seeking and receiving the endorsement of the politically influential police unions.\"\n\nWe also contacted Jim Stergios, executive director of the Pioneer Institute, a Boston think tank that values \"free market principles, individual liberty and responsibility, and the ideal of effective, limited and accountable government.\" He said the Romney administration generally \"limited grant programs to municipalities because their view was that such programs represented a relatively unaccountable entry into local affairs.\"\n\n\"There was also a political principle at work,\" Stergios said in an email. \"Resist the usual small, targeted grants to local constituencies because they opened up all kinds of political fights among those constituencies (the firefighters got a grant, so shouldn't the police officers?) and localities (Bourne, Lawrence, and Worcester all wanted grants for fire stations, why shouldn't other communities?).\"\n\nWe asked Romney\u2019s campaign for a response to Mitchell\u2019s claim. Spokeswoman Allie Brandenburger provided a video clip of comments Romney gave in response to an interview question about his statement that the nation didn\u2019t need more firefighters.\n\nThat had nothing to do with Mitchell\u2019s claim, so we emailed Brandenburger again, but got no reply.\n\nOur rating\n\nMitchell said that as Massachusetts governor, Romney used a line-item veto to cut \"millions of dollars for firefighting equipment,\" including firefighters' \"coats, pants, helmets and boots.\"\n\nIn 2006, Romney vetoed $2.5 million in grants for all types of fire safety equipment, including those Mitchell cited"}

Al Franken, D-Minn., took to the airwaves to defend the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, policy the Obama administration put in place in 2012 after Congress failed to pass immigration legislation.\nDACA defers the deportation of certain illegal immigrants who initially entered the United States as children. President Trump has said he would rescind it and that former President Barack Obama exceeded his authority by signing it.\nNot so, Franken said.\n\"The executive order that President Obama gave on this was actually lawful,\" Franken said in a Sept. 5 interview on MSNBC. \"President Reagan did a similar thing. George H.W. Bush did a similar order.\"\nWe decided to look more closely at whether Reagan and the elder Bush took actions similar to DACA.\nWas Reagan\u2019s 1987 action similar to DACA?\nBecause Reagan and Bush are each credited with issuing multiple executive grants of immigration relief, we asked Franken\u2019s staff to clarify which Reagan and Bush actions the senator had in mind.\nFranken was referring to a 1987 action Reagan took on the heels of the Immigration Reform and Control Act. That sweeping 1986 immigration overhaul granted legal status for many, but not all, illegal immigrants.\nCrucially, the law did not automatically apply to the spouses or children of newly-legalized immigrants, which meant families across the country were vulnerable to being split based on differences in legal status.\nAfter Congress failed to pass a bill to reduce family disruptions, Reagan drew upon his executive authority to do so on his own. His 1987 executive action to legalize the status of minor children of parents granted amnesty under the immigration overhaul affected an estimated 100,000 families. (Note that spouses and children of couples where one parent, but not both, qualified for amnesty\u00a0were not included in Reagan's policy.)\nReagan\u2019s 1987 action parallels Obama\u2019s DACA in some key ways, but differs in others.\nBoth are examples of a president wielding his power not to apply U.S. immigration law in cases where he deems this necessary or appropriate, said David Shirk, a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.\nUsing executive authority this way is not so unusual among modern presidents. As Kenneth R. Mayer, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told us in a previous fact-check, \"Presidents going back to at least Reagan have made unilateral adjustments to immigration law -- adding exemptions, extending protection to classes not covered by existing statutes such as children and spouses, making discretionary decisions about what constitutes \u2018unlawful presence\u2019 or what categories of people here illegally will be the focus of enforcement action.\"\n\n"}

A federal trial court judge in Seattle ruled Feb. 3 that the federal government could not enforce the executive order while the case is pending.\nSo lawyers for the administration appealed that decision to the 9th Circuit, which hears cases from most of the western United States and Alaska and Hawaii. On Feb. 9, a panel of three judges ruled unanimously to affirm the Seattle judge\u2019s decision. (The court didn\u2019t rule on whether the executive order is legal. That will happen later.)\nIt\u2019s possible the administration will try to appeal their case again, this time to the Supreme Court. Right after the judges handed down their decision, Trump tweeted, \"SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!\"\nAs Hannity noted, the 9th Circuit has a reputation for being liberal. But we wondered if he was correct when he said the Supreme Court overturns more cases from the 9th Circuit than any other appeals court in the country \u2014 the implication being that the 9th Circuit is out of step with the Supreme Court.\nIn our research, we found that the 9th Circuit has a higher-than-average reversal rate, but not the highest. Additionally, experts told us that counting reversals doesn\u2019t necessarily say much about the quality or substance of the 9th Circuit\u2019s work.\nThe numbers\nTo evaluate this claim, we turned to SCOTUSBlog\u2019s Supreme Court statistics archive, specifically their Circuit Scorecards, which track how often the Supreme Court justices agree or disagree with the lower court decisions.\nThe Supreme Court hears cases from the 50 state courts and 13 federal appeals courts, known as circuit courts. The cases that the Supreme Court chooses to take on are often disputed among the lower courts, complex, and problematic, so there\u2019s a reasonable chance that the Supreme Court will decide that the lower court\u2019s decision was wrong.\nIn fact, the Supreme Court reversed about 70 percent of cases it took between 2010-15. Among cases it reviewed from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, it reversed about 79 percent.\nThe 9th Circuit\u2019s reversal rate is higher than average, but it\u2019s not the absolute highest among the circuit courts. That distinction goes to the 6th Circuit, which serves Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee, with an 87 percent average between 2010-15. \u00a0The 9th Circuit is in third place.\n\n\n6th Circuit - 87 percent;\n\n\n11th Circuit - 85 percent;\n\n\n9th Circuit - 79 percent;\n\n\n3rd Circuit - 78 percent;\n\n\n2nd Circuit and Federal Circuit - 68 percent;\n\n\n8th Circuit - 67 percent;\n\n"}
{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Kasim Reed The recent process of awarding $3 billion worth of airport vending contracts was the \"most open and transparent procurement process in the city\u2019s history.\"", "evidence": "Critics dogged the city of Atlanta every step of the way during its long slog to award $3 billion worth of contracts at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport.\n\nBusinesses vying to sell food and gifts to travelers howled in protest last year when the city rebooted the process after too many hopefuls fouled up their paperwork.\n\nSome complained decisions were made in haste, or favored businesses with political connections. Others protested when a major vote took place after a closed-door City Council session. Companies that lost out, including Virginia-based SSP America, filed suit. \u00a0\n\nMayor Kasim Reed\u2019s administration waged a public war against them. An April 25 press release issued by his office called SSP out by name. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\"The city is hopeful that SSP America . . . \u00a0will finally cease its litigious and wasteful efforts to overturn the fairest, most open and transparent procurement process in the city\u2019s history,\" said the release, which was sent out by Reed\u2019s representatives.\n\nThe most \"open and transparent\"? That sounds out of character for Hartsfield-Jackson, where dealings have a history of being anything but these things.\n\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, concession operators paid more than $1 million in bribes to elected officials, according to a federal investigation. Seven people, including two former city councilmen, were convicted or pleaded guilty to related crimes.\n\nFormer Mayor Bill Campbell famously served federal prison time in the mid-2000s for failing to pay $160,000 in taxes. Prosecutors said he secretly used airport and other city contracts to make himself and his friends rich.\n\nAnd last year, the city agreed to a $3.9 million legal settlement with Atlanta businessman Billy Corey and his business Corey Airport Services. He argued that the procurement process was rigged when he lost out on an airport advertising contract in 2002.\n\nNow, we\u2019ll cover why Atlanta officials think this latest round was the most open and transparent in city history.\n\nCity spokeswoman Sonji Jacobs, whose name was listed on the press release, gave four major arguments:\n\nCity officials put a big bundle of airport concessions contracts out to bid at once.\n\nBusinesses competed for 11 concessions contracts: nine for restaurants and two for shops. They were worth about $3 billion in revenue over 10 years.\n\nSomething similar took place in February 1995. The city tried to wipe the slate clean by opening bidding on \"almost every concessions space at Hartsfield,\" including restaurants and gift shops, according to a story in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nCity officials released names of project evaluators.\n\nReed announced in June 2011 that he would release the names of evaluators on a panel that reviews and recommends proposals. He said this transparency would head off accusations of conflicts of interest.\n\nInstead, the city waited until January -- after the City Council approved the contracts. Jacobs said in the mayor\u2019s defense that this was earlier than state open records law requires.\n\nBut council members Michael Julian Bond and Felicia Moore told PolitiFact Georgia that under prior administrations, they received evaluator names and related information before the bids went before the full council.\n\nAnd Jacobs\u2019 point about public records law is debatable. \u00a0\n\nNothing in state law says names of committee members appointed by a public agency can be kept secret, Hollie Manheimer, executive director of the Georgia First Amendment Foundation, told PolitiFact Georgia.\n\nReed returned legally obtained campaign contributions from those vying for contracts. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nReed stopped receiving campaign donations from these businesses in late June 2011, and returned some money. We found no evidence that prior Atlanta mayors have taken this step.\n\nHowever, this is more of an anti-influence peddling measure than a transparency effort. \u00a0\n\nThe city released more than 1 million pages of records detailing the procurement process.\n\nWe found no evidence that other administrations have gone through the expense and effort of releasing this many documents. But at first, they didn\u2019t do it willingly.\n\nOfficials released these documents in January after losing concessionaires sued, saying the administration violated public records law by withholding them.\n\nThe Fulton court\u2019s chief judge wrote in a March order that \"only after entry of several court orders\" did the city begin to produce more public records related to the bid process. Since then, though, it has provided many of them.\n\nSSP\u2019s lawyer accused the city\u2019s chief procurement officer of directing city workers to destroy them, but George Maynard, the hearing officer assigned to SSP\u2019s appeal, determined there was no evidence of \"fraud, corruption or abuse.\"\n\nWatchdog groups and some elected officials want more. They noted Maynard was appointed by the mayor, and were concerned that the city\u2019s transportation committee had 12 hours or less to inspect key concessions contract documents before they voted to approve them. \u00a0\n\nTo conclude:\n\nThis latest round of airport contract proposals was not as open as it could have been, and three of the four arguments the city used to claim unprecedented transparency fall short. \u00a0\n\nStill, it may well have been more transparent than all others in Hartsfield-Jackson history. We could find no other instances where more than 1 million pages of documents were put out for public review.\n\nThat said, the city was legally obliged to provide those pages.\n\nThe statement is likely accurate, but meaningless. It\u2019s no great achievement for a city to do what the law requires. Unless that city is Atlanta"}

In fact, on his campaign website, Toomey has an entire section of his \"issues\" page dedicated to \"eliminating corporate welfare.\" So we decided to check the claim.\nIn 2007, Toomey was a congressman from Allentown and the president of the Club For Growth, a conservative group\u00a0that advocates for the reduction or elimination of corporate taxes.\u00a0Toomey appeared on CNBC to discuss tax reform and cutting the corporate tax rate (the top marginal tax rate is 35 percent) which, he says in the interview, would stimulate the economy.\n\"I would disagree with the idea that we want to have a corporate tax burden at all,\" he says in the interview, going on to say: \"All it really does is it creates this insidious opportunity for politicians to play games, to create winners and losers, to have manipulative deductions and loopholes and write-offs. We shouldn\u2019t have any of that. Let\u2019s have a transparent system. Let\u2019s not tax corporations.

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "John Kitzhaber Says his state budget will \"provide an increase in state funding\nfor the 2011-12 school year.\"", "evidence": "Before Gov. John Kitzhaber released his budget proposal for the next two-year cycle, he gave a few hints at how he\u2019d budget some of the biggest pieces of state government. In an e-mail sent out before the Feb. 1, 2011, budget announcement, he says he\u2019ll allocate some $5.56 billion for the state\u2019s K-12 public school system.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. He gets even more specific. Kitzhaber plans to make 52 percent of the total (about $2.89 billion) available in the first year of the cycle.\n\nThis, he says, is the \"equivalent to a $5.78 billion budget for school funding. The effect is to provide an increase in state funding for the 2011-12 school year.\"\n\nThat, naturally, piqued our curiosity given that most of what you hear down in Salem is worrying comments about how education will have to take a cut going forward. And yet, here\u2019s Kitzhaber talking about increased spending.\n\nCould he really be offering the schools more money next year? We decided to find out.\n\nTo start off, it\u2019s helpful to have a clear understanding of where funding is currently. The thing is, the budget for public education has fluctuated several times over the past couple of years. The state revenue forecast is consistently down, which has led to reductions in the budget. Meanwhile, there\u2019s been movement on the federal level to kick funds to states, which have helped balance, in part, some of those earlier cuts. But not all of them.\n\nTo get the most recent number, we called Oregon's Legislative Fiscal Office. According to the office\u2019s most recent calculations, K-12 education is operating on a budget of $5.756 billion. Thatincludes the promise of $35.5 million from a state education stability fund, which may or may not come through. But, for the purpose of this article, we\u2019ll keep it in the total.\n\nOf that $5.75 billion, $342 million has come from the federal government in various forms and $5.41 billion has come from the state. To parse it even more (who doesn\u2019t love lots of numbers?), $2.94 billion went to schools during the 2009-10 school year, while the remaining $2.82 billion went to schools for the current year.\n\nSo, let\u2019s compare these numbers to what Kitzhaber is proposing. \u00a0According to the e-mail statement, Kitzhaber is suggesting a K-12 budget of $5.56 billion for the next two-year period. But for next year in particular, he is suggesting $2.89 billion go to schools. That\u2019s a clear increase in funding (not just state funding, but overall funding) this year over next, by about $70 million.\n\nStill, it\u2019s important to note here, that funding, overall, will take a hit. Sure, the state is throwing in more cash for the upcoming biennium than it did the current -- about an extra $150 million. And yes, the school system will have more cash to work with next year than it did this year. But overall the biennium\u2019s budget is down, $5.756 billion to $5.56 billion. That\u2019s because the state\u2019s increase in funding still doesn't offset lost federal dollars.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, under Kitzhaber\u2019s proposal, that reduction will be felt strongest come the 2012-13 school year. Whereas there will be a $70 million more to work with next year, as compared to the current school year, there will be a $150 million decrease the following year, if you use the current year as the baseline.\n\nBy front-loading 2012, you necessarily leave 2013 with a smaller slice of the funds.\n\nKitzhaber explains his logic in the e-mail: \"Front-loading the funding also provides a year to find cost savings through consolidation and other efficiencies to maintain this level of classroom support during the 2012-13 school year.\"\n\nWhether those cost savings will be realized, nobody can say, so we\u2019ll stick the initial statement, which is that this proposed budget represents an increase in state funding for the upcoming 2011-12 school year. Kitzhaber is right, it does. That said, it\u2019s important to recognize that even with the increase in state funds, the school system will have to make do with less sooner or later. Kitzhaber seems to have chosen later"}

Steve Oroho (R-Dist. 24). He cited that statistic in a May 26 Star-Ledger news story about how the Legislature will fit a Supreme Court-ordered $500 million payment to New Jersey\u2019s 31 Abbott districts in the state budget. Lawmakers have to reach an agreement before July 1, the beginning of the new fiscal year, on how to spend approximately $30 billion.\n\nOroho said in that story that he won\u2019t vote for a budget that sends the $500 million just to the Abbott districts.\n\n\"We have the highest per-pupil cost in the country,\" he said. \"No one can say there\u2019s not enough money in education.\"\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey decided to check whether Oroho was right.\n\nThe senator, a certified financial planner who serves on the Senate\u2019s Budget and Appropriations and Economic Growth committees, told us he researched National Center for Education Statistics data going back to the 2004-05 academic year. He said his statement was based on data for 2006-07, which showed that New Jersey\u2019s per-pupil cost -- for grades K-12 and including all school districts -- was $17,794.\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey contacted the nonpartisan National Center for Education Statistics to vet Oroho\u2019s statistic. We studied nearly 10 years\u2019 worth of data and found that among states, New Jersey has had the highest per-pupil cost in the nation since at least the 1999-00 school year. It\u2019s worth noting that Washington, DC -- not a state -- had higher per-pupil costs than New Jersey from 1999-03 and from 2006-07.\n\nCathy Clement, operations officer for the National Center for Education Statistics, explained that the center\u2019s data comes from information reported by local jurisdictions to states, which then report the data to the U.S. Department of Education. The national center is part of the Education Department\u2019s Institute of Education Sciences.\n\nThe New Jersey Education Association, however, disputes Oroho\u2019s claim.\n\nSpokesman Steve Baker shared with PolitiFact New Jersey the Public Education Finances: 2009 report issued May 20 by the U.S. Census Bureau. It shows that New Jersey was third in per-pupil spending for the 2008-09 year, at $16,271. New York was highest, at $18,126, followed by Washington, DC, $16,408.\n\nThe National Center for Education Statistics told us the discrepancy stems from slight differences in what costs get reported and factors such as whether public charter schools are included.\n\nWe also checked with the New Jersey Department of Education to see which agency\u2019s figures they would rely on for accurate per-pupil cost data.\n\n\"We often cite National Center for Education Statistics,\" said Alan Guenther, department spokesman.\n\nSo why is education so expensive in New Jersey?\n\nBoth Oroho and Baker say there are multiple factors involved. Oroho points to administrative costs and regulatory requirements as possible factors. The NJEA\u2019s Baker, referring to the School Finance 101 blog by Bruce Baker, no relation, an associate professor in the Graduate School of Education at Rutgers University, cited special-needs programming and interventions, as well as education needs for children in poverty, as elements that contribute to per-pupil costs.\n\nLet\u2019s return to Oroho\u2019s statement. The senator says New Jersey has the highest per-pupil costs in the country, but admits basing that statement on data for the 2006-07 and 2007-08 school years. Still, our analysis of data from a nonpartisan arm of the U.S. Department of Education shows that among states only, New Jersey has held the title of highest per-pupil costs in the nation for nearly a decade.

Children were put into the custody of U.S. Health and Human Services and the parents referred for prosecution.\nPast administrations also separated children from the adults they arrived with in the United States. But immigration experts said those separations were relatively rare and nowhere near the scale under the Trump administration.\n\n"}

{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Michael Turner Some \"20,000 Delphi salaried retirees lost up to 70 percent of their pensions\" as a result of \"political favoritism and backroom deals.\"", "evidence": "In April 2012, PolitiFact Ohio issued a \"Mostly False\" rating to a claim by a congressman from Dayton, Michael Turner, over the loss of pension benefits of salaried retirees from Delphi, the auto parts maker.\nTurner had said that some \"20,000 Delphi salaried retirees lost up to 70 percent of their pensions\" as a result of \"political favoritism and backroom deals.\"\nA rating of Mostly False means that the statement contains some element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\nIn this case, the loss of pensions was not in question. The pensions were cut after Delphi, which once was part of General Motors, hit deep financial problems.\nBut the rest of the claim, ascribing blame to political favoritism and Obama administration backroom deals, was not supported by facts. We based the ruling on the available evidence, which included Government Accountability Office reports and congressional testimony.\nWe also noted that eventually, a fuller accounting of the Delphi matter would come out from a special inspector general. When it did, we said, we\u2019d consider taking another look.\nThat report is out. And based on it, we are upgrading the rating a notch to Half True.\nSome background: In 2009, GM was in financial trouble and the federal government bailed it out with a financial package worth more than $50 billion, including a loan and an equity stake in a post-bankruptcy, restructured company. There were others in the auto industry also in trouble, including Delphi. And GM and Delphi were the corporate equivalent of step brothers, if not blood relatives. Delphi was a division of GM until the parts maker was spun off as an independent company in 1999.\nBefore the spinoff, Delphi maintained separate pension funds for its unionized and non-unionized workforces. The non-unionized workers were salaried, many in white-collar or support jobs, and their pension fund was flush. The union pension fund, however, was not.\nIn other cases, this might have meant that the unionized workers would eventually get smaller pensions than planned. But in this case, GM made a deal that kept the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, or UAW, happy, which helped facilitate the Delphi spinoff. The deal was this: GM would make up, or \"top-up,\" the difference between the underfunded pension payments and the amounts the workers would have gotten if their pension fund were in fine health.\nThis was not just benevolence. By agreeing to the top-up, GM was able to hand off Delphi operations without union opposition and keep its outside supply chain running. And so the parties codified the top-up provision and kept it in force.\nBut a decade later, the twin bankruptcies of GM and Delphi created a wrinkle. GM had the right in bankruptcy to void its contracts. That could have meant the end to the top-up agreement.\nIt so happened that by now, the fortunes of Delphi\u2019s nonunion workforce and retirees had turned. The once-full pension fund for non-union, or salaried, retirees was underfunded as well.\nBut unlike their unionized colleagues, the salaried or non-unionized retirees had no top-up deal.\nSo what would happen?\nTwo things: First, the Obama administration would agree to bail out General Motors and give it money to keep operating. But before the final sign-off, \u00a0the administration through its Treasury Department-appointed auto task force would need to review GM\u2019s obligations and make decisions about what and whether it owed Delphi retirees.\nBankruptcies typically involve many parties being told to accept the fact that they are never going to get every penny they are owed. Yet that\u2019s not what happened in the case of the Delphi unionized-worker pensions. GM, with considerable help from the Treasury auto team, agreed that even as it exited bankruptcy as a new organization, it would continue to top-up the UAW pensions from its parts supplier. It also agreed to continue top-ups for the International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers, and the United Steelworkers of America.\nBut GM and Treasury\u2019s auto team left the salaried retiree pensions alone. The non-union retirees would get no top-up. As a result, those retirees would only collect 30 percent to 70 percent of their expected pensions, which would be paid by the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp., or PBGC, the federal agency that takes over failing pension plans.\nWas this fair?\n\n"}
{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Ted Cruz Saturday Night Live executive producer \"Lorne Michaels could be put in jail under this amendment for making fun of any politician.\"", "evidence": "In his brief time in Congress, first-term Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has attracted national attention for his rhetoric. On Sept. 9, 2014, Cruz gave a stemwinder of a floor speech, criticizing a proposed constitutional amendment backed by Democrats.\nThe backers of the proposed amendment, S.J.Res.19, say it\u2019s intended to overturn Citizens United, the Supreme Court decision that loosened campaign-finance laws for corporations. They argue that the court\u2019s ruling has opened a floodgate of campaign spending that threatens the democratic process.\nCruz, however, argues that the proposed amendment severely threatens First Amendment protections that date back more than two centuries.\nPerhaps the most attention-getting portion of Cruz\u2019s lengthy speech (which you can read in its entirety here) came when he suggested that Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of NBC\u2019s long-running show Saturday Night Live, would be put at risk of imprisonment if the amendment were enacted:\n\"When I asked the senator from Minnesota (Al Franken, a former Saturday Night Live writer and actor) in the Senate Judiciary Committee, \u2018Do you believe that Congress should have the constitutional authority to prohibit Saturday Night Live from making fun of politicians, the good senator promptly reassured me he had no intention of doing any such thing. But what we are debating is not the intentions of 100 senators. What we are debating is a constitutional amendment that 49 Democrats are proposing to be inserted into the Bill of Rights. ...\n\"What the amendment says is for any corporation, Congress would have the constitutional authority to prohibit it from engaging in political speech. Well, NBC, which airs Saturday Night Live, is a corporation. \u2026 \u00a0Congress would have the power to make it a criminal offense. Lorne Michaels could be put in jail under this amendment for making fun of any politician.\"\nPolitical observers expect the amendment to fall well short of the two-thirds vote in the Senate that would be required before it went to the House (where it would need a two-thirds vote) and the states (where it would need to be ratified by three-fourths of the states). So the fears Cruz expresses are probably moot.\nStill, many readers asked us to take a closer look at Cruz\u2019s claim about Lorne Michaels and Saturday Night Live. \nWhat the amendment says\nLet\u2019s start by looking at the proposed amendment. Here are the key passages:\n\"Congress and the States may regulate and set reasonable limits on the raising and spending of money by candidates and others to influence elections. \u2026 Congress and the States shall have power to implement and enforce this article by appropriate legislation, and may distinguish between natural persons and corporations or other artificial entities created by law, including by prohibiting such entities from spending money to influence elections. \u2026 \u00a0Nothing in this article shall be construed to grant Congress or the States the power to abridge the freedom of the press.\"\nCruz\u2019s argument\nCruz, both in his speech and in a subsequent telephone interview with PolitiFact, made the case for why Michaels might have reason to worry for his freedom if the amendment were to be ratified. Among his points:\n\u2022 Reading the amendment literally, the SNL scenario closely fits its language. That is, a corporation (NBC) is spending money (to produce and air SNL) that could influence an election (it arguably has in the past, as in its characterization of 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin).\n\"By any measure, NBC is a corporation,\" Cruz said in the interview. \"And the amendment says the government can prohibit such entities from spending money to influence elections.\"\nIn fact, Cruz also argued in the speech and the interview that a literal reading of the amendment also would permit restrictions on the speech of entities as diverse as movie studio Paramount Pictures, publisher Simon and Schuster, the NAACP, the National Council of La Raza, and the Sierra Club. \"Every one of these is a corporation,\" Cruz said.\n\u2022 SNL is unlikely to benefit from the proposal\u2019s press-freedom exemption. While the amendment contains an exemption for freedom of the press, SNL is an entertainment show, Cruz noted, not part of NBC\u2019s news division. \"I agree (the amendment) carves out a specific press exemption, but SNL is by no measure the press,\" Cruz told PolitiFact.\n\u2022 It doesn\u2019t matter that the amendment\u2019s backers promise that the amendment is narrowly targeted at campaign finance rather than political satire. What matters, Cruz counters, is how future generations of lawmakers will view it, once they have such powerful tools embedded in the Constitution.\n\"Lots of Democrats argue passionately, \u2018We don\u2019t intend to prohibit books or movies or Saturday Night Live,\u2019 \" Cruz said in the interview. \"In all likelihood, Congress would not try to do so. But things can change. I am not content to entrust our free-speech rights to the good graces and whims of Congress and hope that politicians don\u2019t abuse their power.\"\nIndeed, Cruz noted that the facts at issue in the Citizens United case involved the ability of a non-profit corporation making a movie critical of Hillary Clinton. \"Democrats say it\u2019s unrealistic, but we\u2019ve already seen government go after a corporation making a movie about a politician.\"\n\n"}

{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Richard Besser \"It used to be that the only children at school who weren't vaccinated were those who had true medical\" conditions. \"Now there are 19 states that allow personal belief exemptions.\"", "evidence": "The measles outbreak linked to Disneyland provided an uneasy backdrop Sunday for talk about another southwestern venue hosting thousands of people from around the country with varying immunization histories: Super Bowl XLIX in Glendale, Ariz.\nOn the news shows, medical experts stressed that the right of parents to choose whether their children vaccinate should not trump the risk that unvaccinated people pose to public health.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention director Tom Frieden said on ABC\u2019s This Week that \"study after study\" has shown there are no long-term hazards with vaccines even though pockets of the population are unwilling to get them. ABC News\u2019 chief health and medical editor Dr. Richard Besser lamented how there was once a time where the only children who wouldn\u2019t get vaccinated had immunity issues.\n\"It used to be that the only children at school who weren't vaccinated were those who had true medical contraindications. They may have an immune problem and couldn't get vaccinated,\" Besser said. \"Now there are 19 states that allow personal belief exemptions. And I think that that is wrong.\"\nThere are two parts to Besser\u2019s statement worth considering. One is that 19 states permit parents to exempt their children from vaccinations because of their personal beliefs. The other is that there was a time when the only children who weren\u2019t vaccinated had true medical conditions.\nThe 19 states\nDocumenting the state-by-state situation is a simple task, so we\u2019ll handle that first. Information compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures, among other sources, backs up Besser\u2019s point.\nWhile there are laws in every state that spell out vaccination requirements for children entering public school, it is easier to avoid them in some states over others. Every state except for Mississippi and West Virginia provides an exemption for religious reasons. Mississippi\u2019s tough vaccination laws result in high immunization rates in its school children.\nAnd as Besser said, 19 states also have exemptions for philosophical, personal reasons. They are Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin. Missouri also has an exemption that applies only to daycare, preschool and nursery school.\nExperts attribute the growth of personal belief exemption laws to pressure from anti-vaccine organizations on policymakers. They use as one benchmark the year 1998, when a study since condemned by peers and retracted by The Lancet, connected the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine with \"leaky gut\" and maybe autism. Another popular year is 1982, when NBC ran the story \"Vaccine Roulette,\" which raised concern about the pertussis vaccine. Historian Elena Conis, author of Vaccine Nation, traces the origins of the movement back to the 1960s and '70s, at a time when people were arguing for tighter environmental regulations, additional women's rights and broader consumer protections.\nIn California, a state well-known for its vaccine resistance, more than 17,200 children enrolled in kindergarten with exemptions from vaccinations based on either religious or personal reasons in the 2013-14 school year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (There is no difference in the CDC reporting for personal or religious reasons.) That was the most of any state by far.\nCalifornia lawmakers tried to tighten up the exemption for personal reasons in 2014 so that instead of just signing a piece of paper, they had to first show they met with a physician who described the risks of going without vaccinations. A Los Angeles Times analysis found an overall decline in the state\u2019s rate of vaccine waivers, dropping from 3.1 percent in 2013 to 2.5 percent in 2014 -- the first drop in a dozen years.\nData-crunching by the Washington Post found that the rate of parents applying for personal belief exemptions was strikingly high in Disneyland\u2019s Orange County, the southern coast up to San Luis Obispo, and parts of the northern edge of the state. Vaccine opposition was lower in less-affluent parts of the state, Los Angeles, San Francisco and the Silicon Valley.\n\"It used to be that the kids that were not vaccinated were from poor families,\" said Catherine Troisi, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center. \"Now we\u2019re seeing the opposite. These are educated parents who are choosing not to vaccinate their kids.\"\nLooking back on vaccine exemptions\n\n"}

And PolitiFact couldn\u2019t reach anyone from ConservativeByte.\n\nBefore our ruling, let\u2019s begin with some basics. Congress resets itself every two years, which means the current edition is the 112th Congress, not the 111th. Why does that matter? \u00a0\u00a0Because the new Congress that begins in January every two years always follows an election and some of the people on the list are no longer in office.\n\nCofall acknowledges this but then continues to list names from the 111th Congress anyway. Those listed as \"card carrying\" socialists who are no longer serving include Robert Wexler (Florida), Phil Hare (Illinois), John Hall (New York), Alan Grayson (Florida), and Neil Abercrombie (Hawaii).\n\nThen there\u2019s this: Real card-carrying Socialists say those members are not Socialists.\n\nThe list that Cofall and dozens more rely upon \"is completely fraudulent,\" said Frank Llewellyn, who served as national director of the Democratic Socialists of America for 10 years until stepping down July 5.\n\nThere is not one member of Congress who is a formal member of the DSA, Llewellyn said. In order to join, a person must fill out a form and pay dues. Even Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, is not a formal member of the DSA, Llewellyn said.\n\nThe last member of Congress who was an actual card-carrying member, he said, was California Democratic Rep. Ron Dellums, who served 28 years in the House until leaving in 1998.\n\nLlewellyn and DSA\u2019s new national director, Maria Svart are chagrined for two reasons. First, they have to spend time knocking down reports that never seem to go away.\n\nSecond, Llewellyn said, \"if we had formal political relationships with 70-odd members, we would be making a lot more money\u2019\u2019 from dues.\n\nFor the record, Fudge, Kaptur and Kucinich say they\u2019ve never been associated with the Democratic Socialists of America.\n\nFudge's spokeswoman, Belinda Prinz, said the same claim came up last year, when the congresswoman's office contacted one website and asked that her name be removed from its list.\n\n\"We're sorry to see this erroneous information get repeated,\" Prinz said. \"She has never been a member of the Democratic Socialists of America and never endorsed their activities or policies.\"\n\nKaptur denied the accusation and said, \"As a Polish-American, I know very well the difference between totalitarian communism and fascism on the one hand and social-democratic governments in Europe that include our NATO allies.\"\n\nHer spokesman, Steve Fought, said the claim \"is part of this unfortunate trend in our country where if you don't agree with someone politically, you vilify and villainize them.\n\n\"A lot of people who throw the word socialism around don't even know what it is and couldn't distinguish the different varieties,\" he said. \"It's a facile way for people who don't understand shades of gray to talk about political movements.\"\n\nKucinich said: \"I'm a Democrat.\"\n\nBad information gets spread all the time. But where did the number, or numbers, come from?\n\nThe list purported to have originated with the DSA says this on page two:\n\nQ: How many members of the U.S. Congress are also members of the DSA?\n\nA: Seventy\n\nIt then lists them by name. What it does not say is that the names are simply lifted en masse from the membership of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a collection of liberal-leaning lawmakers that includes not a single socialist.\n\nAccording to its website, the Progressive Caucus is one of the largest in Congress and works for such causes as economic justice, civil rights and civil liberties as well as global peace and security. Llewellyn said that DSA supports some of the policy positions of the caucus.\n\nVoicing support for positions embraced by a group of lawmakers is a routine part of business on Capitol Hill and is employed by organizations as disparate as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Rifle Association and NORML, a group devoted to legalizing the use of marijuana. But agreeing with some positions doesn\u2019t make a member of Congress a card-carrying Socialist.\n\nLlewellyn says similar accusations of Socialism (with a capital S) have surfaced every election year since 1991 when the Progressive Caucus was created.\n\n\"There\u2019s nothing we can do to stop it, Llewellyn said. \"I can\u2019t tell you the number of times we\u2019ve tried to stop it.\"\n\nMisinformation and smear campaigns also are part of political life.

Joni Ernst of Iowa urged bipartisan cooperation to pass a longstanding agenda item for Republicans and some Democrats -- the Keystone XL pipeline.\nThe project has been in the works since 2008, and its current version involves a 875-mile pipeline that would run from Morgan, Mont., to Steele City, Neb. Building this link would allow 830,000 barrels of oil per day to move from the tar sands fields in Alberta, Canada, to refineries on the Gulf Coast.\nOpponents of the pipeline say it will increase greenhouse gas emissions and increase the risk of water pollution from spills.\nSupporters speak of improved energy security and jobs, and blame the Obama administration for stalling what they consider critical infrastructure supported by many business leaders and labor unions.\nHere\u2019s what Ernst said during her State of the Union response on Jan. 20, 2015.\n\"The new Republican majority you elected started by reforming Congress to make it function again.

On July 16, Bahrain\u2019s Gulf Daily News reported that \"Edward Snowden has revealed that the British and American intelligence and the Mossad (Israel\u2019s intelligence agency) worked together to create the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).\" This operation, they said, was codenamed \"Hornet\u2019s Nest.\"\nAnd as recently as Aug. 18, the Palestinian Authority insisted that the Islamic State is a Zionist plot by the United\u00a0States\u00a0and Israel. The United States, though, has been bombing the Islamic State in Iraq for more than a week; not quite ally behavior.\nIt would have been easy to dismiss this theory off-hand as another hoax emerging from the general lack of information about the Islamic State -- like the allegations that President Barack Obama released Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi in 2009, which we rated False.\nBut we wanted to trace this conspiracy theory to its source to see whether or not it has legs.\nThe taxonomy of a hoax\nIn their refutation of the Hornet\u2019s Nest story, Time points out that as early as June, Iranian sources have been accusing America of creating the Islamic State. On June 18, the Iranian Fars News Agency quoted Iran\u2019s top commander, Hassan Firouzabadi, blaming\u00a0the Islamic State on the West.\n\"The (Islamic State) is a move by Israel and the U.S. to create a safe margin for the Zionists against the resistance forces in the region,\" Firouzabadi said. The U.S. and Israel, he continued, are reacting to \"the recent victories of President Bashar Al-Assad in Syria\" and \"in Iraq.\"\nTime -- along with major American news sources, Al Jazeera, Daily News Egypt, the UN, and several other Middle Eastern countries -- say that\u00a0the Islamic State is an offshoot of al-Qaida. In fact, we wrote last week about how al-Qaida rejected the Islamic State in part because of ideological differences and disputes over authority.\nThat\u2019s not to say America is completely blameless when it comes to the Islamic State -- the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the weapons deals it struck to try to bring down Assad may have all played a part in ISIS\u2019s rise. But there\u2019s no evidence of an American, British\u00a0and Israeli plot to create ISIS.\nYes, this is a conspiracy theory\nThe only lucid defense of the idea that Western intelligence agencies created the Islamic State intentionally comes from the Center for Research on Globalization (CRG), a Canadian website that bills itself as an alternative news source, but has advanced specious conspiracy theories on topics like 9/11, vaccines\u00a0and global warming.\nKurt Nimmo, writing for the CRG through InfoWars, had four points defending the plausibility of the idea that America and Israel helped create the Islamic State.\n\n"}

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Jon Kyl Obama's position on nuclear arms is a \"march toward global zero.\"", "evidence": "In a discussion of the new START treaty on NBC's Meet the Press on Nov. 29, Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) outlined several reservations he has with the proposed treaty to control nuclear arms.\n\nKyl said he had concerns with provisions related to such things as missile defense and modernization of the nuclear arsenal.\n\nBut more than that, Kyl said he has a major philosophical difference with President Barack Obama's administration with regard to arms control -- namely whether the goal should be for a world free from all nuclear weapons.\n\n\"You have questions extraneous to the treaty but within the context, which is, is this all that's standing between us today and the administration trying to negotiate even deeper, further cuts, which it's indicated that it wants to do in its march toward global zero, something that a lot of us disagree with,\" Kyl said.\n\nWe looked into several comments made by Kyl about the new START treaty, but here, we are weighing whether it's accurate to characterize the Obama administration's position on nuclear arms as a \"march toward global zero.\"\n\nThere's little question that Obama's stated goal -- even before he became president -- has consistently been a world free of nuclear weapons.\n\nSome examples:\n\n* A presidential campaign position paper on foreign policy promised that Obama \"will make the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons worldwide a central element of U.S. nuclear policy.\"\n\n* In his defining speech on nuclear weapons as president, Obama on April 5, 2009, told an audience in Prague, \"So today, I state clearly and with conviction America's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.\"\n\n* And in remarks at the United Nations Security Council Summit on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Nuclear Disarmament on Sept. 24, 2009, Obama said, \"The historic resolution we just adopted enshrines our shared commitment to the goal of a world without nuclear weapons. And it brings Security Council agreement on a broad framework for action to reduce nuclear dangers as we work toward that goal.\"\n\nIn that United Nations speech, Obama quoted former President Ronald Reagan, who said, \"A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. And no matter how great the obstacles may seem, we must never stop our efforts to reduce the weapons of war. We must never stop until all -- we must never stop at all until we see the day when nuclear arms have been banished from the face of the Earth.\"\n\n\"That is our task,\" Obama said. \"That can be our destiny. And we will leave this meeting with a renewed determination to achieve this shared goal.\"\n\nSo there is no debate that a \"march toward global zero\" has been Obama's stated goal. But just how fast does Obama plan to march?\n\nIn every case, Obama's statements about working toward a world without nuclear weapons are closely followed by a major qualification:\n\n\"America will not disarm unilaterally,\" Obama stated in the campaign literature. \"Indeed, as long as states retain nuclear weapons, the U.S. will maintain a nuclear deterrent that is strong, safe, secure and reliable.\"\n\n\"I'm not naive,\" Obama said in Prague. \"This goal will not be reached quickly -- perhaps not in my lifetime. It will take patience and persistence. But now we, too, must ignore the voices who tell us that the world cannot change. We have to insist, 'Yes, we can.'\"\n\nThat's why, in 2008, PolitiFact gave a False rating to a claim in a chain e-mail that Obama wants to \"unilaterally disarm our nation.\"\n\nIn fact, Obama's nuclear policy closely mirrors that espoused by George P. Shultz, William J. Perry, Henry A. Kissinger and Sam Nunn in two opinion pieces published in the Wall Street Journal in 2007 and 2008. In the second piece, titled \"Toward a Nuclear-Free World,\" they wrote that, \"Progress must be facilitated by a clear statement of our ultimate goal. Indeed, this is the only way to build the kind of international trust and broad cooperation that will be required to effectively address today's threats. Without the vision of moving toward zero,\nwe will not find the essential cooperation required to stop our downward spiral. In some respects, the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons is like the top of a very tall mountain. From the vantage point of our troubled world today, we can't even see the top of the mountain, and it is tempting and easy to say we can't get there from here. But the risks from continuing to go down the mountain or standing pat are too real to ignore. We must chart a course to higher ground where the mountaintop becomes more visible.\"\n\nThe authors have significant foreign policy experience: Shultz\u00a0was secretary of state under Ronald Reagan; Perry was defense secretary under Bill Clinton; Kissinger was secretary of state under Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford; and Nunn was chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee. And their policy was supported by numerous foreign policy experts at the time. But not all. Some foreign policy experts argued that their proposal would be difficult, if not impossible, to implement.\n\nKyl's statement about Obama's \"march toward global zero\" may have been a bit of a bumper sticker slogan, but it was also \"completely accurate\" and an \"unusually candid\" assessment of the differing philosophies on nuclear arms reduction, said John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, a Web site that specializes in information about defense, the military, weapons of mass destruction and homeland security.\n\n\"There are two different churches that people go to on this issue,\" Pike said. \"I think Kyl worships at the church that nuclear weapons are a good thing,\" he said. Kyl's position is that nuclear weapons can't be uninvented, he said, and that the U.S. wouldn't be as safe without them. \"And that's not the church that Mr. Obama attends.\"\n\nSome may argue over how quickly Obama intends to \"march toward global zero\" -- Obama has said he's not even sure it's possible in his lifetime. Obama has always noted that as long as other countries retain nuclear weapons, the United States will maintain a strong nuclear arsenal. Nonetheless, Obama has consistently and repeatedly stated that his ultimate goal is to enact policies that bring the world closer to his ultimate goal: a world without nuclear weapons"}

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Sheldon Whitehouse \"An April study found that about 70 percent of ads in this election cycle have been negative [due to SuperPACs], up from only 9 percent through the same period in 2008.\"", "evidence": "Negative campaign ads: most people say they hate them, but studies show that many people are swayed by them.\n\nThus, major races can get pretty nasty, and there's a fear that the presidential contest this year will break all records for nastiness, thanks to the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 Citizens United decision. \u00a0The court upheld the right of persons, organizations and corporations to spend as much as they would like on political advertising -- while hiding their involvement -- through the use of organizations known as super political action committees (Super-PACs).\n\nTo shed some light on who is behind such attack ads, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-RI, \u00a0has been promoting the DISCLOSE Act. The name is an acronym for Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in Elections.\n\n\"When you don't have accountability, there's no limit to the things that people will say,\" Whitehouse said during a debate on the floor of the Senate. \"One of the restraints on the vitriol and the filth that so often is part of the American political debate is that candidates have to stand by their ads.\n\n\"And if you say something that is awful, if you engage in relentless negative attacks, voters may charge you a price for that,\" Whitehouse said. \"Well, that of course disappears when the name behind the ad is attached to no living person or corporation. It's just an entity, it's a sham, it's a phony, it's a shell.\"\n\nThe DISCLOSE act would require some tax-exempt groups that engage in political advertising to reveal individual donors who gave $10,000 or more.\n\nCritics say the act discriminates because it wouldn't apply to unions. They also say disclosure might open donors up to intimidation and ridicule, inhibiting free speech.\n\nDuring an unsuccessful push to bring the proposal to a vote in the Senate -- a drive blocked twice by Republicans, on July 16 and 17 -- Whitehouse said the Citizens United decision was already sparking a giant increase in negative political advertising.\n\n\"An April study found that about 70 percent of ads in this election cycle have been negative, up from only 9 percent through the same period in 2008,\" he said.\n\nThat's a big jump in negative advertising. We wondered if it were true.\n\nThe context\n\nWhen we contacted Whitehouse's office, spokesman Seth Larson sent us to a study released May 2, 2012, by the Wesleyan Media Project at Wesleyan University. It defined a negative advertisement as an ad in which the candidate's opponent is mentioned.\n\nThe study looked only at TV ads in the presidential races and only ads broadcast from January 1 through April 22 of 2008 and the same period in 2012.\n\nIt turns out that Whitehouse quoted the study accurately. The researchers said that 70.0 percent of all ads in 2012 were negative during that period, compared with 9.1 percent in 2008.\n\nBut Whitehouse also said that the Citizens United decision is responsible for that increase in negative ads, so let\u2019s look at that aspect.\n\nThe political scientists we spoke with said the Supreme Court decision is having a huge effect on the tone and rhythm of the 2012 campaign.\n\nThe Wesleyan study suggests that the effect was already clear in the first four months of this year.\n\nConsider the ads purchased by special-interest groups or SuperPACs.\n\nOf the 10,062 special-interest group ads aired during the first quarter of 2008, 75 percent were rated positive and 25 percent were rated negative.\n\nBy 2012, the number of special-interest ads had exploded, jumping more than 12-fold to 123,062. In addition, the mix of ads had reversed, with only 14 percent positive and 86 percent negative.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of ads bought by candidates themselves plummeted, from 289,622 in the first quarter of 2008 to 74,267 this year, an indication that they were letting the special interest ads carry the ball for promoting their candidacies.\n\nAs Michael Franz, co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project, said in the report, \"That's a lot of money and airtime backed by undisclosed sources.\"\n\nOther factors affect rate\n\nBut Franz and the other experts we consulted cautioned that additional factors are also at work.\n\nThe first four months of the 2008 race were very different from the same period in the 2012 contest.\n\nIn early 2008, \"one reason the number was so low was because the [Barack] Obama and [Hillary] Clinton campaigns didn't really attack each other on TV that much,\" said Franz, now at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine. \"They did off the air, and they were obviously quite ruthless. But in the ads themselves, there wasn't a lot of sniping back and forth against each other. They promoted themselves primarily.\n\n\"That changed for Obama in the general election,\" Franz said. \"He was a very negative candidate and once the general election started, it became an overwhelmingly negative campaign, as it usually is in the general election.\"\n\nDuring the first four months of 2012, SuperPACs drove up the percentage of negative ads, he said, \"but also candidates have been overwhelmingly negative against each other in the [2012] Republican primary.\"\n\nSo let's look at the types of ads placed by the candidates themselves.\n\nIn 2008, only 9 percent of the ads placed by all the candidates in the first four months of the year were negative.\n\nBy 2012 that number had grown to nearly 53 percent.\n\nThe first four months of a presidential election year are not necessarily the best guide to the rhythm of the rest of a presidential campaign. \"I really don't think they're indicative of what's to come,\" said Mary Ellen Balchunis, a political scientist at LaSalle University in Philadelphia. \"It's how close the polls are, it's whether your opponent is going negative, it's whether you are responding.\"\n\nEarly in the contest, \"the ads are generally more about who the candidate is and what the candidate would do. That's particularly true for a challenger,\" said Stephen Farnsworth of the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Va., a key swing state. \"There are always some negative ads, but they are really sprinkled in the mix. In the fall, when people are really turning their attention to the election, that's when the number of negative ads escalates.\"\n\n\"In this election cycle, things are already so negative, it's hard to imagine that there's much room for them to get more negative between now and November,\" said Farnsworth, author of \"Spinner-in-Chief: How Presidents Sell Their Policies and Themselves.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nSheldon Whitehouse said, \"An April study found that about 70 percent of ads in this election cycle have been negative, up from only 9 percent through the same period in 2008.\"\n\nHe is correctly quoting the study, but the context of his comment makes it clear that he blames the SuperPACs, which were freed up by the Citizens United decision.\n\nThose special-interest groups are certainly playing a much larger role this year, in part because they have become the major source of TV ad purchases.\n\nBut the data also reveal that the candidates are being far more negative earlier in the campaign than they were four years ago, and that also drove up the percentage of negative ads in the beginning of 2012.\n\nBecause his statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate the claim as Mostly True.\n\n(Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter: @politifactri.

Here\u2019s what he said:\n\"I was elected to the Senate in 1983. So I've been here more than 32 years. It's still two Selmas. The unemployment rate for African-Americans is roughly three times that of whites. But the poverty rate is roughly nine times that of whites. So there are two Selmas.

All the blacks go to their churches and all the whites go to their churches, most of the children are in separate schools.\"\nIt didn\u2019t surprise us that there is a racial gap between rich and poor in Selma. But is the poverty rate really nine times as high for blacks as it is for whites? We turned to figures from the U.S. Census Bureau to find out.\nTo cover our demographic bases, we looked at the poverty measures for not one but two jurisdictions -- the city of Selma, and the county to which it belongs, Dallas County.\nIn the city of Selma, the Census Bureau counted 3,562 white residents and 15,908 black residents on average between 2009 and 2013. The poverty rate for the white population was 14.4 percent, compared to 48.4 for the black population.\nThat\u2019s a stunningly high percentage of people in poverty -- nearly half of all African Americans in the city are counted as impoverished. Still, Sanders exaggerated the degree of difference between black and white poverty rates in the city. The black rate is about 3.4 times the white rate, not nine times higher.\nDallas County, meanwhile, had 12,413 white residents and 29,402 black residents. The poverty rates were 13.6 percent for whites and 44.9 percent for blacks. That makes the ratio almost identical to Selma itself -- 3.3 times higher for blacks.\n\n"}

Host Chuck Todd aimed to clarify Trump\u2019s views. Here\u2019s the key exchange:\nTodd: \"Should the federal government set a floor, and then you let the states --\"\nTrump: \"No, I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do.

Instead, he was among a bipartisan group of 28 co-chairs who signed off on the document after consulting with business and community leaders across the state.

And we love that he loves Twitter, not least of all because it leads to an interesting PolitiFact Oregon item now and again.\n\nLast week, Adams took to the social networking service to bemoan the decline of arts education in city schools.\n\n\"Clarification: Only 18% of Portland ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS have art instruction compared to 83% nationally.\"\n\n(He initially tweeted the same statistic but failed to note that it applied only to elementary schools.)\n\nHe offered a link to the website of the Creative Advocacy Network, a group that is pushing for a strong arts curriculum. (His spokeswoman Caryn Brooks confirmed this was the source of the Tweet as well.)\n\nWe spoke with Executive Director Jessica Jarratt Miller, who said the national number came from a study done by the U.S. Department of Education. That study looked at the percent of public elementary schools that have instruction designed for various arts subjects. According to that study -- which found its numbers through a representative survey process -- about 94 percent of elementary schools have music education and 83 percent have visual arts education.\n\nThe Portland-specific numbers came from CAN\u2019s own research. Jarratt Miller said those numbers reflect the percentage of Portland-area schools that reported employing an art teacher in a specific field even if it was only part time. According to their figures, 58 percent of Portland-area schools employ a music teacher and 18 percent employ a visual arts teacher.\n\nNow, we had no reason to doubt CAN\u2019s figures. We\u2019d PolitiFacted the group before when it said 77 percent of elementary school students in Portland graduate without taking an arts class and found its numbers reliable. What we couldn\u2019t be sure about was whether the group was actually examining the same thing the federal department was examining. Could the two statistics be compared?\n\nThat\u2019s always difficult, Jarratt Miller said. \"In any case, I believe that at the 30,000 foot level (how many schools provide some level of instruction in art or music), we have successfully pulled comparable data from Portland and from this national study,\" she wrote in an e-mail.\n\nOur concern was that the national study simply asked whether schools were \"offering instruction designated specifically for various arts subjects\" whereas the Portland figures were looking at the number of schools employing a teacher specifically for an arts field. The difference is important because a school could offer art instruction in a classroom -- as many Portland schools do -- without explicitly employing an art teacher.\n\nLucky for us, the national study looked at who was teaching those subjects. It found that specialists were teaching the music classes 91 percent of the time and the arts classes 84 percent of the time. Other schools had classroom teachers doing art instruction or brought in outside volunteers and artists-in-residence.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t necessarily clarify how closely CAN and the fed\u2019s numbers can be compared. But it does seem to demonstrate that a gulf exists.\n\nIf you do the math, you find that about 70 percent of U.S. elementary schools offer visual arts classes that are taught by a specialist (someone with a teaching certificate in an arts discipline), whereas only 18 percent of Portland schools have a dedicated teacher for visual arts. And, in truth, that 18 percent might have to be shifted lower to match the federal statistic perfectly because CAN didn\u2019t ask schools to note whether their art teachers were certified in any way, though Jarratt Miller suspects most are.\n\nEven an 18 to 70 percent split seemed too big to be true to us. We asked Jarratt Miller what some of the causes could be. Part of it, she said, was the simple fact that Oregon has no statewide art education requirements, unlike most other states. (That seemed strange to us -- but the Oregon Department of Education confirmed it.)\n\nThat brings us to our ruling. The figures Adams used in his tweet both come from reliable sources. We\u2019re not sure they can be perfectly compared, but even if you do your best to chip away at the national number, you\u2019re still left with a dramatic gulf in which 70 percent of elementary schools nationally say they offer art education with a certified art teacher while only 18 percent of Portland-area schools can likely say the same.\n\nThe general point here, that Portland is falling behind the national average for art education is as accurate as it is startling"}

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Sean Spicer There has been a \"dramatic expansion of the federal workforce in recent years.\"", "evidence": "One of President Donald Trump\u2019s very first acts was to place a hiring freeze on the executive branch, in a promised show of fiscal responsibility.\n\"This memorandum counters (the) dramatic expansion of the federal workforce in recent years,\" press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters in his first-ever daily press briefing Jan. 23.\nThe memorandum, which Trump signed earlier that day, says federal agencies will not fill any vacant positions or create new ones for up to 90 days, or until a plan for reducing the number of federal government employees goes into effect. Military personnel are exempt from the plan, as are any positions deemed necessary for national security and public safety.\nSeveral news outlets quickly jumped on Spicer\u2019s assertion that the federal workforce has expanded dramatically in recent years, saying it was incorrect. We looked at the data ourselves and found that Spicer\u00a0is cherry-picking.\nThe White House press release about the hiring freeze memorandum offered more detail, saying the federal workforce expanded \"from approximately 1.8 million federal civilian employees during the (Bill) Clinton administration to approximately 2.1 million as of 2016 (an approximately 17 percent increase).\"\nThe news\u00a0release figures appear to come from the Office of Personnel Management, whose data shows an increase from 1.78 million civilian employees in the executive branch (excluding the postal service) at the end of 2000 to 2.08 million at the end of 2014. That\u2019s an increase of about 17\u00a0percent. At an increase of roughly 1 percent a year, it sounds like Spicer is exaggerating when he calls it \"dramatic.\"\nHowever, in choosing to compare the end of the Bill Clinton administration to the end of Barack Obama\u2019s, the new White House is pitting the year with the lowest federal employment since 1950 against a relatively normal year \u2014 exaggerating the significance of the growth.\nCounting the employees\nFederal government employment has hovered around 2 million for decades, as shown in the graph below. In fact, the federal government had more employees for about half of the past 70 years than it did in 2014.\n\nDuring the Korean War in the 1950s, the government capped employment\u00a0in the federal workforce at 2 million employees. Even though the cap was eventually lifted, it has remained politically popular to keep the government around the same size, said Paul Light, a professor of public service at New York University.\nThe size of the federal government workforce stayed about the same as the country\u2019s population grew. The size of state and local governments ballooned, however, and so have the number of contractors working for the federal government.\nThe last concerted effort to shrink the federal government workforce happened under former President Bill Clinton. The end of the Cold War enabled his administration to reduce the workforce from 2.2 million in 1992 to 1.78\u00a0million in 2000, with most of the drawdown happening among Defense Department civilian employees. \u00a0\n\"The Clinton administration was an aberration,\" \u00a0Light said.\n\n"}

The remark came in the context of Gingrich\u2019s suggestion that poor students should be given the opportunity to fill duties currently handled by school janitors, calling it a way to instill a work eithic while also saving money.\n\n\"As to schools, I think every person up here worked at a young age,\" Gingrich said. \"What I suggested was kids ought to be able to work part time in school, particularly in the poorest neighborhoods, both because they could use the money. If you take one half of the New York janitors who unionized and paid more than the teachers -- an entry level janitor gets paid twice as much as an entry level teacher. You take half those janitors you could give -- you give lots of poor kids a work experience in the cafeteria, in the school library, in the front office and a lot of different things.\"\n\nWe received a flurry of requests from readers that we fact-check the claim that in New York City, \"an entry level janitor gets paid twice as much as an entry level teacher.\"\n\nWe suspect that Gingrich\u2019s claim originated with an April 18, 2011, report by the local NBC News affiliate titled, \"School Custodians Earn More Than Bronx Teachers.\" Here\u2019s an excerpt:\n\n\"Teachers in at least one Bronx school earn less money than the building custodian, a stat that has surprised students and parents.\n\n\"Although it is commonly assumed teachers' wages top the salaries of custodians, an NBC New York analysis of public payrolls shows many custodians make more money than even the highest paid city teachers.\n\n\"According to the union contract governing New York City Custodian Engineers, the men and women responsible for keeping school buildings clean and operating can make up to $114,000 a year in base pay. The highest paid teacher, with a masters degree and decades of tenure, can hope to make just over $100,000 in base pay. \u2026\n\n\"The pay-scale differences are even more pronounced for rookie teachers and custodians. First-year New York City school teachers without graduate degrees, make about $45,000 a year. The minimum pay for a first-year custodial engineer is almost $80,000 a year.\"\n\nThe NBC story was correct about the starting salary for teachers in the New York City Department of Education, at least those with only a bachelor\u2019s degree and no prior teaching experience. Such teachers start at $45,530. Teachers\u00a0who have a master\u2019s degree but no teaching experience start at $51,425.\n\nBut what about the people Gingrich called \"janitors\"?

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Tim Kaine Under former President George W. Bush\u2019s administration \"while the population in that period grew by 10 percent, the number of jobs in the nation grew by 1 percent.\"", "evidence": "Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine may not have given the crowd at the Feb. 19 Jefferson-Jackson Dinner in Richmond the scoop on whether he\u2019s running for the U.S. Senate, but he made no secret of his disdain for former President George W. Bush\u2019s record on job creation.\n\nKaine said in a speech\u00a0that during the Bush administration \"while the population in that period grew by 10 percent, the number of jobs in the nation grew by 1 percent.\"\n\nWe wondered if that was really the case. Alec Gerlach, a DNC spokesman, couldn\u2019t identify the source on which the former Virginia governor based his claim. So we tried to find it on our own, comparing census records from January 2001 - the month Bush was sworn in - to January 2009, when Bush left office.\n\nThat can be a bit tricky because the U.S. Census Bureau only does actual counts at the start of each decade, and that doesn\u2019t exactly line up with Bush\u2019s term, which ran from Jan. 20, 2001 to Jan. 20, 2009. Between each census, however, the bureau provides monthly estimates on the number of people in the country.\n\nThe figures show that on Jan. 1, 2001, the U.S. population was 283.7 million. By Jan.1, 2009, that number had risen to 305.8 million.\n\nThose estimates show the population increasing by about 7.8 percent, below Kaine\u2019s claim that the population jumped by 10 percent under Bush.\n\nWhat about the second half of Kaine\u2019s claim that the number of jobs only grew by 1 percent under Bush\u2019s tenure?\n\nWe turned to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which show that in the month that the former president took office, there were about 132.5 million non-farm employees in the U.S.\n\nIn January 2008, the month after the official start of the Great Recession, the total number of non-farm workers peaked at 138 million.\n\nBut as the economic downturn took hold, that number declined, and by the time Bush left office in January 2009 there were 133.6 million non-farm employees.\n\nSo over the course of Bush Administration, the number of non-farm workers rose by about 1.1 million, or .83 percent. That\u2019s just shy of Kaine\u2019s claim that the number of jobs rose by 1 percent under Bush.\n\nWhile Kaine\u2019s numbers are a little off on employment and census, he\u2019s right in suggesting that that U.S. population grew 10 times faster that jobs during George W. Bush\u2019s presidency.\n\nEven so, several economists told us comparing raw population growth and job numbers is not a preferred way to examine job creation versus demand. That\u2019s because not all of the new people -- such as babies born during the Bush administration -- need jobs.\n\nWe were told a more meaningful measure is labor force participation: the percentage of the population between 16 and 64 that is either employed or looking for work. According to BLS, participation was at 67.2 percent when Bush took office and 65.7 percent when he left.\n\nHere\u2019s another thing to keep in mind: Economists have told us time and again -- on this claim and others -- that the policies of presidents and governors have only minor impact on economic cycles and job creation. \"They get too much credit and too much blame,\" said Sylvia A. Allegretto, economist at the Institute for Research on Labor & Employment at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nKaine\u2019s comment didn\u2019t address job growth in Virginia during the Bush administration. But it you\u2019re curious, Virginia did better than the nation on Kaine\u2019s scale.\n\nThe number of nonfarm employees in the Virginia rose from 3.53 million in January 2001 to 3.7 million in January 2009 -- an increase of 4.8 percent.\n\nThe U.S. Census estimate for Virginia that was closest to the start of Bush\u2019s term was a July 1, 2001, \u00a0figure showing the state had 7.19 million. \u00a0A July 1, 2009, estimate shows the state\u2019s population had grown to 7.88 million -- a 9.6 percent increase.\n\nTo summarize, Kaine said that during former President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, the U.S. population increased by 10 percent while the number of jobs went up only 1 percent.\n\nEstimates from the U.S. Census and the BLS show that during the Bush years, the population increased by 7.8 percent while the number of jobs rose by .83 percent.\n\nKaine\u2019s numbers are a little off his and spokesman doesn\u2019t know where they came from"}

John Kitzhaber offered his thoughts on several subjects during an address to the Oregon School Boards Association -- everything from PERS and No Child Left Behind to third-grade reading levels and his upcoming budget.\n\nBefore wrapping up his speech, he said he wanted to touch on one more item: The \"disconnect\" between \"what is bargained for at the local level and the actual fiscal condition of the state.\"\n\nThe state, he said, has 197 school districts but nearly 350 local bargaining units and contracts. \"These one- to three-year contracts that are bargained at the local level in many cases are disconnected from the revenue that's available in the state's school fund -- yet the state is required to come in on the back end and pick up 70 percent of the cost.\"\n\nThere\u2019s a fair point to be made there -- the state picks up part of the tab for spending that it doesn't have any hand in negotiating. Yet, the assertion that the state picks up 70 percent of what school districts spend caught us off guard.\n\nWe did a quick check of the math from 2009-10 (that\u2019s the most recent year that we have data available from the federal government) and found that total spending by K-12 school districts and education service districts was about $5.5 billion. The total state contribution to K-12 education that year was $2.95 billion. With a little division, you find that the state really only covered 53.4 percent of the bill -- not the 70 percent Kitzhaber referenced.\n\nThat\u2019s a ways off, so we got in touch with Amy Wojcicki, the governor\u2019s spokeswoman, to see what was up. The governor, she said in an e-mail, was referring to \"funding for schools that comes through the State School Fund. This includes local revenues (primarily property taxes) and state funding. The state funding equals about two-thirds of the State School Fund.\" \u00a0\n\nIf you go back to the 2009-10 figures, you can tease apart three pots of money in the total $5.5 billion going to K-12 education. About $4.4 billion comes from Oregon -- $2.95 billion from the state and $1.5 billion from local property taxes and whatnot. Another $1 billion or so comes from the federal government in various forms. To get that 70 percent figure, the governor looked at just the money originating in Oregon: $2.95 billion is about 66 percent of $4.4 billion. (He then rounded up.)\n\n"}

Can you just assume consumers would be out $366 billion since that's how much the program would raise from fuel companies?\n\n\nNo.\n\n\n\"It's just wrong,\" said John Reilly, an energy, environmental and agricultural economist at M.I.T. and one of the authors of the report. \"It's wrong in so many ways it's hard to begin.\"\n\n\nNot only is it wrong, but he told the House Republicans it was wrong when they asked him.\n\n\n\"Someone from the House Republicans had called me (March 20) and asked about this,\" Reilly said. \"I had explained why the estimate they had was probably incorrect and what they should do to correct it, but I think this wrong number was already floating around by that time.\"\n\n\nIt continues to float.\n\n\nThat's just not how economists calculate the cost of a tax proposal, Reilly said. The tax might push the price of carbon-based fuels up a bit, but other results of a cap-and-trade program, such as increased conservation and more competition from other fuel sources, would put downward pressure on prices. Moreover, consumers would get some of the tax back from the government in some form.\n\n\nThe report did include an estimate of the net cost to individuals, called the \"welfare\" cost. It would be $30.89 per person in 2015, or $79 per family if you use the same average household size the Republicans used of 2.56 people.\n\n\nThe cost would grow over time as the program ramps up, but the average annual cost over time in today's dollars \u2014 that is, the \"average annual net present value cost\" \u2014 is still just $85 per person, Reilly said. That would be $215.05 per household.\n\n\nA far cry from $3,128. And that isn't the only inaccuracy in the claim.\n\n\nThe Republican press release said the cap-and-trade program would pay for \"nationalized health care.\"\n\n\nBut Obama's\n\nhealth care proposal\n\nis not for \"nationalized health care.\" It does call for a \"National Health Insurance Exchange\" with private insurance options plus a new public plan based on the one currently available to members of Congress \u2014 but consumers could still keep their private insurance if they want, as Obama emphasized during his presidential campaign.\n\n\nEven if it were true that Obama wants to nationalize health care, he does not envision paying for health care reform with the cap-and-trade program as the Republicans alleged. Rather,\u00a0his $634 billion health care reserve fund is to come from efficiencies in Medicare and Medicaid and decreased deductions for some charitable contributions by upper-income taxpayers, according to Obama's proposed budget.\n\n\nThe House Republicans partially corrected this portion of the claim, changing their Web site and sending out an updated press release that says the cap-and-trade program would pay for \"increased spending\" rather than health care.\n\n\nBut it still calls cap-and-trade a \"light switch tax\" and claims the whole cost would come from consumers.\n\n\n"}

Kirk Watson, D-Austin, was aired as a Senate committee sent Watson\u2019s proposal, Senate Bill 360, to the Senate, which advanced the measure to the House about a week later.\n\nThe proposal, like companion legislation by Rep. Eddie Lucio III, D-Brownsville, would remove a provision from state law permitting a person to euthanize a dog or cat in an animal shelter using compressed carbon monoxide. Other animals, including birds and reptiles, could still be killed by the method, but dogs and cats in shelters could only be killed by injection with sodium pentobarbital, which is considered more humane and less costly.\n\nThe story said the list of shelters using carbon monoxide--none of them in Central Texas--was compiled by the Texas Humane Legislative Network, a nonprofit that lobbies on behalf of animal welfare, which Watson spokesman Steve Scheibal described as Watson\u2019s source for statistics related to the proposal.\n\nIn a \"fact sheet\" posted online, the network says it contacted the state\u2019s 1,200-plus cities and found that 32 Texas animal shelters, including one in Greenville, \"continue to utilize the outdated and inhumane carbon monoxide method of euthanasia.\" Separately, in a February 2013 blog post, the network\u2019s vice president, Shelby Bobosky, said more than 30 Texas cities, including Sherman and Terrell, stopped using carbon monoxide euthanasia within the last five years.\n\nBy email, one of the network\u2019s lobbyists, Jack Erskine, sent us a chart, dated March 18, 2013, listing 31 cities as using carbon monoxide to euthanize animals: Beeville; Bovina; Bracketville; Cuero; Devine; Eagle Pass; El Campo; Freer; Ganado; George West; Grand Saline; Greenville; Hondo; Kenedy; Kermit; Kingsville; Lyford; Mathis; Odessa; Plainview; Portland; Raymondville; Refugio; Sabinal; Seminole; Sinton; Stinnett; Taft; Van Horn; Victoria; and Yoakum. The chart says that all but two of these results were confirmed by the group from Dec. 17, 2012, through March 4, 2013.\n\nPractices vary, according to footnotes to the chart quoting email responses from cities. Cuero responded that in 2011, 12 juvenile animals were euthanized by injection while 513 others were subjected to carbon monoxide.\n\nBobosky pointed out that a state rule already bars carbon monoxide from being used to euthanize any animal \"reasonably presumed to be less than 16 weeks of age\" or for \"any animal that could be anticipated to have decreased respiratory function, such as the elderly, sick, injured or pregnant.\"\n\nThe rule continues: \"Such animals may be resistant to the effects of carbon monoxide and the time required to achieve death in these animals may be significantly increased. In animals with decreased respiratory function, carbon monoxide levels rise slowly, making it more likely that these animals will experience elevated levels of stress.\"\n\nAccording to another footnote to the network\u2019s chart, El Campo said it would start using injection on a trial basis in 2013. Meantime, Freer reported that its shelter had been demolished and no one was currently trained to euthanize animals, while Ganado said its shelter had been shut down and gave no indication if gas would be used in a shelter under construction, according to a footnote.\n\n"}

Charles Bass, of supporting the privatization of Social Security.\n\n\"Unfortunately for New Hampshire, my opponent is part of the problem,\" Kuster told supporters during a June 7 rally outside the Statehouse.\n\n\"He supports privatizing Social Security, risking trillions more on Wall Street,\" she said. \"Our country and our state cannot support more of the same from Congressman Bass.\"\n\nKuster and Bass know each other well. In the 2010 race, Bass defeated Kuster by a tight 2 percent margin. But, how well does Kuster know the Congressman\u2019 stance on Social Security? We decided to check the records.\n\nTo support Kuster\u2019s claim, her campaign staff pointed us first to a series of votes and statements Bass has made on the matter over his years in office.\n\nBass, a Peterborough Republican, served six terms in Congress between 1994-2006 before returning to office in 2010, and the matter of Social Security came up several times during his first years in office.\n\nIn 2001, President George W. Bush launched the President\u2019s Commission to Strengthen Social Security to look into the future of the institution. In December of that year, the 16-member panel issued its final report, which urged Congress to incorporate a system of private accounts for personal investment.\n\nOpposed by Democrats, the commission\u2019s recommendations never reached the floor of Congress for a vote. But, the House did consider a number of proposed resolutions and amendments on both sides of the issue.\n\nBass joined each of his Republican colleagues in voting against H.AMDT.245, a Democrat sponsored amendment that would have prohibited any funding of the commission\u2019s recommendations. Kuster\u2019s staff pointed to the amendment, which failed 188-238, as evidence of Bass\u2019 support for privatization. But, according to analysts, the amendment was more of a partisan pre-emptive strike than a true endorsement of privatization.\n\n\"He may have (supported privatization),\" said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the conservative Cato Institute. \"Republicans generally did at that point, but this vote was certainly not a vote that could be read that way.\"\n\nOver the years to follow, several efforts to push a privatization bill fell short at the committee level. But, Bush brought the issue to the forefront once again when he included it in his 2005 State of the Union address.\n\nIn the Feb. 2, 2005 speech, the president outlined a plan for partial privatization, which he pledged to make a key part of his second term agenda.\n\nImmediately following the speech, Bass issued a written statement supporting the President\u2019s plan, which reflected one of the recommendations of the 2001 commission.\n\n\"I am an advocate of the President's call for Social Security reform and will work with him in the next two years to save and protect this important program,\" Bass wrote, according to the National Journal and Project Vote Smart.\n\nSix weeks later, Bass further endorsed Bush\u2019s plan during stops in Claremont and Lebanon, N.H.\n\n\"I support the establishment of private savings accounts because it allows low- and middle-income workers the chance to get ahead,\" Bass said, according to the Eagle Times, of Claremont.\n\nPresident Bush\u2019s plan, to allow workers under 55 the option of directing up to 4 percent of their payroll taxes into private accounts, came as close as political discourse has reached in recent years to a debate over privatization.\n\n\"Virtually no one has proposed replacing all of Social Security with private accounts,\" said Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \"Given the way the debate has evolved, being for ... privatization doesn't mean you\u2019re for privatizing the whole darn thing.\"\n\nIn past rulings, PolitiFact has determined that the private accounts proposal does not meet the definition of full privatization.\n\nIn August of 2010, President Barack Obama earned a Mostly False ruling on a similar claim about Congressional Republicans, and later that month, Arkansas Sen. Blanche Lincoln earned the same rating on a claim about her opponent, Rep. John Boozman.\n\nBass\u2019 position on Social Security, like those of other Republicans addressed in these past PolitiFact pieces, is in support of giving taxpayers the option of investing in private Social Security accounts, according to campaign spokesman Scott Tranchemontagne.\n\n\"To address this financial crisis facing the Social Security program, one such idea Congressman Bass has supported would create a program that would allow individuals to voluntarily place a portion of their money that they currently pay as part of the payroll tax and place it into a personal account,\" Tranchemontagne wrote in an email to The Telegraph. \"Saying that (he) supports \u2018privatizing Social Security\u2019 is pure political rhetoric devised by Democrat spin doctors to frighten seniors.\"\n\nOur ruling:\n\nBass, like most other Congressional Republicans at the time, supported President Bush\u2019s plan to introduce the option of private savings account into the Social Security equation.

Around 2009, the agency began focusing on distributors who were shipping millions of doses into relatively small communities.\nThe DEA holds two legal hammers over bad actors. One, called a show cause order, requires the company to prove why it shouldn\u2019t have its permit to sell drugs taken away.\nThe bigger hammer is an immediate suspension order, which stops all shipments on the spot. The company can argue its case under both actions, but with the first one, operations continue during the hearing process, while with the second, operations shut down right away.\nJim Geldhof retired from the DEA in 2016 after nearly four decades. He told us that formal sanctions were a last resort.\n\"I can\u2019t think of one time that we didn't try to get a company into compliance before we issued any kind of order,\" Geldhof said.\nBut Blackburn saw the DEA as trigger happy.\nBlackburn supported changing the rules\nIn a 2011 House hearing on prescription drug diversion, Blackburn said certain things had to be kept in mind.\n\"First, to what extent should duly-licensed prescription drug manufacturers be required to spend time, money and resources on trying to envision every new way that their products might be abused,\" Blackburn asked.\nBy 2012, her focus was more on DEA oversight of distributors and pharmacies.\n\"Should we be thinking of a more surgical approach to addressing the issue of prescription drug abuse rather than just looking at suspension of licenses?\" she asked a DEA official at a House hearing. \"Is there a more proportional approach to take rather than just going to an immediate suspension?\"\nBlackburn was unswayed by testimony that DEA regularly met with companies before taking formal action.\nThe bills\nIn 2014, Blackburn firmly linked herself to legislation that added new requirements before the DEA could move against a distributor. \u00a0She put her name to two versions of the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act as they were \u00a0introduced, and at one point, Blackburn took the lead during debate on the House floor.\n\n"}

But something that the teacher said in the anti-Mandel commercial stood out -- a new and measurable charge in a race in which many other other issues are litigated over and over.\n\nDenoia said, \"I read that Josh Mandel voted to let insurance companies deny coverage for autism.\" \u00a0\n\nThis was actually the second claim in the teachers union ad. The first was that \"I heard that Josh Mandel wants to allow insurance companies to deny medical coverage for pre-existing medical conditions.\"\n\nMandel unquestionably supports repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which says that starting in 2014 insurers may not deny coverage for pre-existing conditions. Mandel says other portions of the act, including fines on employers who do not provide health coverage, could harm the economy.\n\nSince issuing a statement in June saying the law should be fully repealed, Mandel has said in interviews that he would support keeping some provisions, including the one on pre-existing conditions. Exactly how that would work is not known.\n\nCovering people with high health care expenses could drive up insurance costs, insurers say, unless nearly every American, healthy or sick, is required to have insurance and spread the financial risk. That very mandate is the cornerstone of the Affordable Care Act. There could be other ways to block denial, including expanding state-based high-risk pools (which have their own cost issues) or passing reforms in less-divisive existing laws, conservative groups say.\n\nCould they work, or is this all just a political sop, as Democrats suggest? That is speculative. The NEA has made a claim based on what Mandel says he opposes but not on Mandel\u2019s later statement of intent. He opposes the current law but says he could support something else to take care of pre-existing conditions. Since the form of that \"something else\" is not yet set and we cannot measure intent on a true-false spectrum, we cannot rate this claim by the NEA.\n\nBut what about the claim that Mandel voted to deny autism coverage?\n\nMandel has, in fact, voted on autism coverage. He was in the Ohio General Assembly at the time.\n\nA 2009 state bill would have mandated that health insurers cover autism. The bill, backed by autism-care groups, passed the Ohio House but never got out of the Ohio Senate. Mandel, in the House, was among the minority voting no.\n\nAccording to news coverage, opponents said they worried the mandate would drive up premiums, which small employers could not afford. This was also the view of the National Federation of Independent Businesses, which lobbied against the bill.\n\nYet the bill contained controls against excessive costs. According to the bill language and a related analysis we read from the Ohio Legislative Service Commission, the legislation stipulated that any company could opt out of the coverage requirement if it could show this mandate drove up its insurance costs by 1 percent or more. \u00a0\n\nMandel\u2019s campaign communications director, Travis Considine, acknowledged Mandel\u2019s \"no\" vote. But he pointed us to an amendment that Mandel supported before voting against the final bill. Intended to help control costs, the amendment would have required an attending psychologist or physician to develop a treatment plan for each autism patient using insurance, and to limit mandatory autism coverage to $36,000 a year, according to the bill language and a legislative summary. The amendment also would allow insurers to request reviews of treatment every six months.\n\nThe amendment passed unanimously and its requirements were included in the final bill. That final bill had 57 \"yes\" votes and 39 votes of no, including Mandel\u2019s, before moving the state Senate, where it died. The support group Autism Speaks says it expects a new version to emerge in Columbus soon.\n\nConsidine also told us that in a separate matter, Mandel voted for state legislation providing money for a special education scholarship program. Special education students sometimes transfer out of their local schools and attend alternative programs to get the individualized attention their parents want for them. The scholarships are similar to vouchers, reducing parents\u2019 costs, and have been popular among families with autistic children.\n\nThis may help show that Mandel is not heartless. But it does not change the accuracy of the NEA claim that Mandel \"voted to let insurance companies deny coverage for autism.\" The point of the commercial, in fact, comes in Denoia\u2019s final line: \"Ohio needs a senator who will stand up to the insurance companies...\"\n\nTwo points are worth mentioning.\n\nFirst, the NEA couched its claim with the teacher saying, \"I read that Josh Mandel voted to let insurance companies deny coverage for autism.\" (Italics added for emphasis.) Some ad campaigns use similar words to get a little wiggle room if their accuracy is challenged. Hey, the teacher is only saying what she read. But in this case, no couching was necessary. The teacher\u2019s reading comprehension was good.\n\nSecond, as a point of semantics, Mandel did not actually vote to deny autism coverage; it was already denied by many insurers. But he voted against requiring coverage, which has the same effect as voting to allow insurers to deny it.\n\nThat\u2019s additional information that provides clarification"}

In the background, a hockey player misses each shot he takes. \"Record spending, over 40 votes for higher taxes and Franken voted for Obamacare. Then voted to exempt himself and Congress from enrolling in it. For Minnesota, it was miss after miss after miss.\"\nMcFadden\u2019s argument gets it wrong and hinges on a technicality. PolitiFact wanted to address the topic of a congressional exemption, one we\u2019ve taken a look at already from other Republican lawmakers.\nHow Congress gets its health plans \nPrior to the Affordable Care Act, members of Congress chose their plans from the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program. They had an employer subsidy, similar to the one an average American usually gets from a large employer.\nBut as the health care reform was drafted, Republicans wanted to make sure Democratic members of Congress would get a taste of their own medicine, so to speak. McFadden\u2019s office pointed us to a 2009 amendment to the Affordable Care Act proposed by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, that called for members of Congress to buy their insurance on the healthcare.gov marketplaces. Like most Democrats, Franken voted against that amendment.\nAround the same time, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., put forward a similar provision. The main difference was that Coburn\u2019s didn\u2019t indicate that legislators could put their employer-provided subsidies toward marketplace plans.\nFranken and other Democrats actually became sponsors on Coburn\u2019s bill. When asked on the Senate floor if he was serious about purchasing insurance on the marketplace, Franken responded: \"I talked to my wife, Franni. We have been married 34 years now. I talked to her a couple of weeks ago. I said if this passed, we should do the public option. She said, 'Absolutely.' Yes, I am perfectly serious about this.''\n\n"}

And he proposed that if Trump runs for re-election in 2020, he\u2019ll have to release his taxes to get on the ballot in this crucial swing state.\nSen. Jay Chaudhuri, a Democrat from Raleigh, introduced a bill with that requirement. In case its target was unclear, he called it the \"Tax Returns Uniformly Made Public Act,\" or the T.R.U.M.P. Act.\n\"I filed the T.R.U.M.P. Act because I believe every presidential candidate, including Donald Trump, should disclose their tax returns,\" Chaudhuri told The News & Observer. \"I did so for three reasons. First, every major party presidential candidate for the last 40 years has made his or her tax returns public. Second, such disclosures allow the public to know whether these candidates have conflicts of interest. For example, does Donald Trump have business dealings with Russia? Finally, this bill has a lot of support \u2013 by a majority of North Carolinians and members of both parties, including Republican Congressman Walter Jones of North Carolina.\"\nWe won\u2019t check Chaudhuri\u2019s claim about every major modern presidential candidate releasing tax returns, since the work has been done for us. Our friends at PolitiFact Wisconsin previously ruled that same claim, as made by Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, as Mostly True.\nBut we were intrigued by Chaudhuri\u2019s final claim, that \"this bill has a lot of support \u2013 by a majority of North Carolinians and members of both parties.\"\nPolitical polarization\nChaudhuri\u2019s sentence was phrased somewhat vaguely. It appears he\u2019s talking about \"a majority of North Carolinians and (some) members of both parties.\" Yet it\u2019s also possible to read it as saying most members of both parties. But that\u2019s unlikely, since if he had meant that he wouldn\u2019t have needed the first part of the sentence, and in the end we interpreted it as some members of both political parties.\nIn Congress, some barely even cuts it. Rep. Walter Jones was one of only two Republicans not to vote the party line last month, when Congress voted down an attempt by Democrats to pass a national bill similar to what Chaudhuri is proposing for North Carolina.\nBut partisan polarization in Congress often doesn\u2019t accurately reflect their constituents. So we\u2019re more interested in what Chaudhuri had to say about public opinion statewide, since he\u2019s promoting a state-level bill.\nHis T.R.U.M.P. Act is likely a long shot, just like that doomed national bill, since Republicans also control the N.C. General Assembly. Some politicians and legal experts have also questioned whether such a bill \u2013 which has also been introduced in at least 24 other states \u2013 would even be constitutional.\nNevertheless, it would be intriguing if Chaudhuri is right about widespread support behind this idea.\n\n"}

Won't solve whole problem but is a start.\"\nHe posted that comment the day after a man opened fire at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., killing nine. According to news accounts, authorities subsequently collected 14 guns owned by the man, who killed himself at the scene.\nHours before Bird tweeted, ATF Assistant Special Agent in Charge Celinez Nunez said at a news conference that all of the weapons were purchased legally, seven of them by the shooter or his family members in the last three years.\nAnd was Bird right about sweeping support for universal background checks?\nA previous \u2018True\u2019\nBird\u2019s claim rang a bell. In April 2013, we found True a claim by Lee Leffingwell, then Austin\u2019s mayor, that 90 percent of Americans and 74 percent of National Rifle Association members supported background checks of gun purchasers. Polls taken in 2012 and 2013 supported both figures, though one taken closest to Leffingwell\u2019s comment indicated support among all Americans possibly slipping a bit below 90 percent.\nCurrently, background checks are required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers but not for gun sales by private sellers. But President Barack Obama and others have called for requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales. In 2013, the National Rifle Association suggested that an expansion would fail to rope in criminals.\nA January 2013 Pew Research Center poll found 85 percent of all respondents in favor of making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks, with comparable support from Republicans, Democrats and independents, Pew said. The margin of error for the entire sample was 2.9 percentage points.\nSeveral 2015 polls\nBy email to our inquiry about Bird\u2019s statement, Pew spokesman Brian Mahl pointed out a center survey of 2,002 adults taken from July 14-20, 2015, that found (again) 85 percent of respondents in favor of making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks.\nPew said in its August 2015 results summary: \"While there is broad support for several specific gun policy proposals \u2013 and opinion on these measures has not changed significantly since 2013 \u2013 the public continues to be more evenly divided in fundamental attitudes about whether it is more important to control gun ownership or to protect the right of Americans to own guns.

For the record, the church\u2019s pastor has not endorsed a candidate in the race and said he\u2019s invited every candidate, including Obama, to speak at his church.\n\nAbout 45 minutes into his remarks, Santorum made this statement: \"Now we have an administration that\u2019s trying to wipe the decks.

PolitiFact Georgia wondered about this line about Obama\u2019s proposal to eliminate charitable deductions for higher-income taxpayers.\n\nObama has consistently proposed changes in charitable deductions that some religious organizations and nonprofit groups say would reduce giving by the rich. The White House counters that his ideas would result in \"modest\" changes, while others say the wealthy will still give.\n\nThe president has proposed in his budget for fiscal year 2013 a reduction -- but not eliminating deductions for individuals making more than $200,000 a year or families reporting income greater than $250,000. The fiscal year will begins Oct. 1 and end Sept. 30, 2013.\n\nThe proposal is similar to other plans Obama has put forward since taking office in 2009, experts on the matter told PolitiFact Georgia. The president has talked about reducing the deduction for the wealthiest income earners from 35 percent to 28 percent. None could recall an outright proposal to completely eliminate the deductions for higher-income Americans.\n\n\"It\u2019s limiting, not eliminating,\" Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, said of the Obama plan.\n\nNick Kasprak, an analyst at the Tax Foundation, said he was not aware of any effort by the Obama White House to eliminate charitable deductions for the highest income earners. He wondered whether Santorum was referring to the Pease Limitation, which reduces most itemized deductions by a complicated formula (we\u2019re talking about the government here) that involves an individual\u2019s adjusted gross income. But the Pease Limitation would not completely eliminate deductions for the wealthy.\n\nWilliams suggested Santorum may have slipped up in this part of his speech to the Forsyth County audience.\n\n\"It could be a loose statement,\" Williams said, being charitable.\n\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan congressional committee, said in a report last year that charitable deductions cost the federal government $30 billion to $40 billion a year. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPolitiFact Georgia filled out a form on Santorum\u2019s campaign website with questions about this statement, but it didn\u2019t get a reply.

We emailed the spokesman twice but didn\u2019t get a reply.\n\nSantorum\u2019s statement seems off base from anything we\u2019ve seen or read.\n\nThe Obama administration has talked repeatedly about reducing charitable deductions, not eliminating them"}
{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "George Will Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, cast votes for TARP, the stimulus, and an individual mandate for health care.", "evidence": "The Tea Party movement shook the political world last weekend when two Utah Republicans knocked U.S. Sen. Robert Bennett out of contention for renomination during a state Republican convention. Commentators immediately hung Bennett's defeat on two of his past decisions -- to vote in favor of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which helped bail out key financial institutions in 2008, and his efforts to co-sponsor a health care bill with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. Both actions have been unpopular with Republicans, especially conservatives in the GOP's base.\n\u00a0\nDuring a roundtable on ABC's This Week, syndicated columnist George Will took a crack at analyzing Bennett's defeat.\n\u00a0\n\"This is an anti-Washington year,\" Will said. \"How do you get more Washington than a three-term senator who occupies the seat once held by his father, a four-term senator, who before that worked on the Senate staff and then as a lobbyist in Washington? He's a wonderful man and a terrific senator, but the fact is, he's going against terrific headwinds this year, and he cast three votes, TARP, stimulus, and an individual mandate for health care. Now, you might like one, two or all three of those, but being opposed to them is not outside the mainstream of American political argument.\"\n\u00a0\nWe checked to see whether Bennett did indeed vote for TARP, the stimulus and a requirement that individuals purchase health coverage. Here's what we found:\n\u00a0\n\u2022 Bennett did vote for the TARP legislation (H.R. 1424) on Oct. 1, 2008, along with 33 other Republican senators.\n\u00a0\n\u2022 Bennett voted against President Barack Obama's economic stimulus bill, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (H.R. 1), on Feb. 13, 2009. Only three Republican senators voted for the bill--Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine, and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. (Specter is now a Democrat.)\n\u00a0\n\u2022 The only time that Bennett made a floor vote on a bill containing an individual health care mandate came with the Democratic health care bill. During the vote on final passage on Dec. 24, 2009, Bennett joined every other Republican in voting against the bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (H.R. 3590).\n\u00a0\nIt's true that Bennett did co-sponsor the Healthy Americans Act with Wyden, and that measure did include a requirement that most Americans purchase health coverage. But it was significantly different from the main Democratic bill because it relied more heavily on health insurance exchanges. It never reached the floor for a vote, and because Will said that Bennett had \"cast three votes,\" including one for an individual mandate, he was at best only partly accurate in characterizing Bennett's record on that issue.\n\u00a0\nAll told, Will was correct that Bennett voted for the TARP bill. But he was incorrect that Bennett voted for Obama's stimulus bill, and it was inaccurate for him to suggest that Bennett cast a vote for an individual mandate. He actually voted against a bill with an individual mandate, even though he also co-sponsored a bill that included an individual mandate that didn't advance out of committee"}

We will focus our fact-check on whether Frankel spent $13,000 on a marble shower in a private bathroom at City Hall. We will also touch on why she got that bathroom and how it ended up with marble.\n\nThe origin of the bathroom claim\n\nFrankel suggested that PolitiFact personally inspect the bathroom which is now in the office of mayor Jeri Muoio. So we traveled to inspect the bathroom in West Palm Beach city hall on Oct. 22.\n\nThe bathroom does have beige marble on the floor and a stand-up shower. Large marble tiles cover the main part of the bathroom floor and the shower walls. The bathroom also has a standard white toilet, a sink and narrow cherry wood shelves for towels and plastic blinds over the windows. It looks like a bathroom in a new hotel, but it\u2019s not luxurious or palatial. (View photos from the Palm Beach Post.)\n\nFirst, some background about the city hall which was part of a controversial $150 million City Center project that included a library, photo center and parking garage. Frankel was a leader in getting the project built but in West Palm Beach the mayor only votes if there is a tie. That means that the City Commission voted to build the project. City spokesman Elliot Cohen said there were multiple votes about the project but no tie votes. Hasner\u2019s campaign notes that when Frankel broke a tie to fill a commission vacancy in 2006 she chose a City Center supporter.\n\nThe bathroom controversy started with media coverage about the new city hall from then Palm Beach Post gossip columnist Jose Lambiet. (He now has his own website and writes a column for the Miami Herald, a PolitiFact Florida partner.)\n\n\"Yes, marble, as in most Palm Beach mansions. In the middle of a recession,\" Lambiet wrote in 2009. \"Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer!\"\n\nThe column quoted Frankel:\n\n\"In the big scheme of things, it was probably a minuscule cost,\" Frankel said. \"I didn't ask for it. The designer did. I don't even know if I'll ever use the shower. But this building was constructed to last 100 years, and it's not been built for me. It's been built for mayors after me.\"\n\nLambiet wrote several weeks later that a statement by the builder, Dan Catalfumo, showed that the \"bathroom/shower\" in Frankel\u2019s office cost $13,323.\n\nThe cost for plumbing the entire city hall was $1.6 million and the value of stone and tiles was $1.2 million, Lambiet wrote.\n\n\"For privacy, security, and job efficiency reasons, the designers included a private bath within the mayor's office,\" Frankel spokesman Chase Scott said at the time. \"It is a small, commercial grade facility, and its cost was in the same range as the other bathrooms in city hall.\"\n\nScott no longer works for the city, but when PolitiFact Florida contacted him, he said Frankel did not request the marble.\n\n\"Lois Frankel did not design or have any input into the materials used, as they were all selected by the architect. I know this because at the time City Center was completed we gave tours, and I needed all the design information,\" \u00a0Scott told us in an email.\n\nScott said he had requested the bathroom be part of the mayor\u2019s office because mayors work into the evening, are often outdoors in the heat, and have to hold press conferences, \"I believed it was a good idea for all future mayors to have the ability to freshen up, as their office is often their real home.\"\n\nDid the shower cost $13,000?\n\nHasner's ad states that the shower alone cost $13,000, but we couldn\u2019t find any documents to support that claim.\n\nLambiet said he no longer had that builder\u2019s statement from 2009, and we could not reach Catalfumo. (He now has much bigger\u00a0 problems.)\n\nFrankel\u2019s campaign sent us to two sources -- project architect Young Song and project executive J.J. \u00a0Wolfe who worked with Catalfumo.\n\n\"We never designed a marble shower,\" said architect Young Song. According to the plans, the mayor\u2019s bathroom was supposed to be tile.\n\nWolfe said he used marble that was left over from another job, so it didn\u2019t add to the project tab.\n\n\"We thought we are doing something nice, and it turned into big fiasco. The marble was free, so it seemed like a reasonable thing to do at time,\" Wolfe said. \"If I could take back, I would put in the \u00a0ugliest pink polka-dotted tile in there I could come up with.\"\n\nWolfe said $13,000 for the shower was an inflated figure that didn\u2019t reflect the actual costs. It was based on an average for the bathroom that the builder came up with based on the plumbing, figures and materials, Wolfe said.\n\nFrankel said that in the old city hall, people would sometimes follow her into the bathroom, which was a security risk. In case of hurricanes, mayors have to work around the clock, too. So while she didn\u2019t ask for the private bathroom, she didn\u2019t veto it, either. \u00a0\"I thought it was a good idea, and I still do,\" she said. She left her successor a shower cap when she left office in 2011.\n\nHasner\u2019s bathroom access\n\nTo be fair, we researched the bathroom access Hasner had when he was a state legislator including House Majority leader. He had no special private bathroom, his campaign said.\n\n\"There is no bathroom in the Majority Leader's personal office or the larger majority office, said Ryan Duffy, spokesman for the House speaker. \"The closest bathroom is the public bathroom in the hallway outside the majority office.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nAt last, we are ready to close the lid on this claim.\n\nHasner\u2019s ad said that Frankel \"spent $13,000 in taxpayer money on a marble shower in a private bathroom.\" The underlying message here is that Frankel engaged in government waste.\n\nBut Frankel didn\u2019t have some sort of sole power here to make that bathroom happen. It was part of a much broader $150 million project approved by the City Commission.\n\nThe city built a new city hall while Frankel was mayor that included a private bathroom for her. A gossip columnist obtained a statement from the builder at the time that said the \"bathroom/shower\" cost $13,323. We were unable to see that statement for ourselves.\n\nHasner\u2019s campaign says the shower alone cost $13,000. But the project executive who worked for the builder said that was the cost of the overall bathroom. And the builder decided to use that marble -- which wasn\u2019t in the architect\u2019s plans -- because it was leftover from another job. There is no evidence that Frankel ordered up that marble.\n\nWhether a mayor needs a private bathroom and shower with or without marble is a decision we leave for the taxpayers. But we have seen no proof that the shower alone cost $13,000 -- that appears to be the overall price tag for the bathroom which was part of a $150 million project"}

{"label": "half-true", "claim": "SEIU \"Republicans fought to protect tax loopholes for corporations that send our jobs overseas.\"", "evidence": "On Aug. 10, 2010, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., released a victory-lap press release after her chamber passed a bill to provide $26 billion in aid to states and localities. Pelosi and fellow Democrats touted the bill as a way to save the jobs of 319,000 state and local employees, including teachers and health care workers. Republicans blasted it as more unaffordable stimulus spending and a giveaway to unionized government workers. Ultimately, the bill passed on a near-party-line vote, 247-161, and was quickly signed into law by President Barack Obama.\n\nIn the news release, Pelosi emphasized that the bill was fiscally responsible. In a series of bullet points, the release said that the bill \"is fully paid-for by closing costly corporate tax loopholes that allow corporations to ship American jobs overseas.\" It added that the bill \"reduces the deficit by $1.4 billion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\"\n\nWe wondered about Pelosi's statement that the bill is \"is fully paid-for by closing costly corporate tax loopholes that allow corporations to ship American jobs overseas.\"\n\nSo we turned to the official arbiter of the costs of congressional legislation, the Congressional Budget Office. In its cost estimate, CBO backs up the assertion that the bill is \"fully paid-for.\"\n\nSpecifically, between 2010 and 2019, the bill is estimated to actually reduce the deficit by $3 million. When you add in an additional year -- making the budget window 2010 to 2020 -- the bill would reduce the deficit by $1.371 billion or, rounded up, the $1.4 billion that the Speaker's release refers to.\n\nCase closed? Not quite.\n\nThe release said the bill \"is fully paid-for by closing costly corporate tax loopholes that allow corporations to ship American jobs overseas.\" That's not the case.\n\nAccording to CBO's analysis, the corporate tax changes in the bill that Pelosi is referring to will amount to $9.8 billion between 2010 and 2020. These are a mix of tax policies that only a CPA could understand, from \"rules to prevent splitting foreign tax credits from the income to which they relate\" (worth almost $4.3 billion in newly captured revenue) to \"denial of foreign tax credit with respect to foreign income not subject to United States taxation by reason of covered asset acquisitions\" (worth more than $3.6 billion), to \"limitation on the amount of foreign taxes deemed paid with respect to section 956 inclusions\" (worth $704 million).\n\nBut that $9.8 billion in corporate tax cuts won't cover the full $26 billion cost of the bill. The bulk of the money comes from something Pelosi's office chose not to mention in the press release -- almost $12 billion in cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (more commonly known as the food stamp program) beginning in 2014. Another $1.1 billion would come from cuts to advanced refundability of the earned income tax credit starting in 2011. The earned income credit is a tax credit that benefits the working poor. Several billion dollars more would come from a variety of spending cuts known as rescissions.\n\nSome of Pelosi's fellow Democrats complained about the cuts on the day of the vote, even though they ultimately chose to support the bill anyway.\n\n\"I am outraged by a reduction in Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Program benefits that is used to pay for this measure,\" said Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis. \"Those who receive the meager SNAP benefits are the most poor and the most vulnerable in our society.\"\n\nSaid Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill. \"Although this legislation is critically needed, I am greatly disappointed that the Senate included as a 'pay-for,' a provision reducing (stimulus)-enacted increases in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, or food stamps, beginning in 2014. SNAP provides vital, short-term support to individuals during their greatest time of need, ensuring that there is food on the table for themselves and their children.\"\n\nIn the meantime, because few lawmakers like to vote for cuts to programs that serve poor families, some suggest that the food stamp cuts will be rescinded before they take effect. Indeed, Pelosi, in a fact sheet about the bill, said that \"House Democrats will work to restore this funding before the cuts are implemented in 2014.\" The fact sheet did not indicate how that will be paid for.\n\n\"Of course, no one believes these cuts will be allowed to take place,\" said J.D. Foster, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. \"This is fantasy land.\"\n\nSo Pelosi's news release is highly misleading because it leaves out the fact that almost half the money paying for the bill comes from cuts to a program very popular with Democrats.\n\nIt's worth noting that Pelosi has taken reporters' questions about the food stamp cuts, and in a floor speech before the vote, Pelosi said in part, \"While I don\u2019t support all of the provisions, I am not happy about the taking money from our energy sector or from food stamps, but I hope that we can, Mr. Chairman, make that up in another way.\" In addition, the fact sheet sent to reporters by Pelosi's office cited the food stamp cuts.\n\nSo while Pelosi's release was correct in saying the bill was \"fully paid-for,\" it was incorrect to simply say that came from \"costly corporate tax loopholes\" (though it wouldn't have had much Democratic appeal if she'd added \"and cuts to food stamps.\") In reality, not even a majority of the money is from corporate tax provisions. If Pelosi had said this during a fast-paced television interview, we'd be willing to cut her some slack, but this description came from a press release written by her office, so they had ample time and space to explain all of the bill's provisions, as they had in fact done in other contexts"}

Gone, too, are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power and prestige.\"\nTrump added, \"If we hadn\u2019t reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would not now be witnessing this great economic success.\"\nWhen we reached out to the Trump campaign, they offered several statistics showing Trump has notched greater gains than Obama did, such as manufacturing job creation, the unemployment rate, and economic growth. We found those statistics, and other specific facts Trump cited during the State of the Union, were accurate, or largely so.\nHowever, unlike Obama, who inherited the Great Recession, Trump inherited an economy that was already getting back on its feet. Overall, we found a continuation of the favorable trend lines Trump inherited from Obama.\nWe looked at 15 common economic statistics, from unemployment rates to growth in gross domestic product to poverty, foreclosures, and bank failures.\nThey cover the period of the Great Recession until today. Where possible, we\u2019ve highlighted periods under a Republican president in red and periods under a Democratic president in blue.\nThe bottom line: For virtually each of these measurements, we found that the trend lines continued almost seamlessly from the second half of Obama\u2019s presidency into the first three years of Trump\u2019s tenure. Trump\u2019s claim that he turned around a failing economy is wrong.\u00a0\n\"I do not think economic gains have been any faster or better under Trump than gains we would have forecast based on the steady improvements we saw in the economy and job market in President Obama\u2019s second term,\" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution.\u00a0\nAlso, no president has total control over the factors affecting the economy. Broader trends beyond their powers \u2014 from international economic conditions to technological changes \u2014 shape the course of the economy as well.\n\"All our decisions together produce the economy,\" said Aaron Sojourner, a University of Minnesota economist. \"It doesn't change when the resident of the White House does.\"\nEmployment statistics\nFor unemployment rates and for median weeks of unemployment, the declines under Obama were at least as fast \u2014 if not faster \u2014 than they have been under Trump. That holds for several of the racial and ethnic groups Trump often cites in speeches, as well as for women.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMeanwhile, since the recovery gained speed, the pattern of monthly job gains has been quite similar under both Obama and Trump. That\u2019s also broadly true for manufacturing job gains, a metric that Trump has been especially focused on.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nThe percentage of Americans either working or looking for work took longer to recover than other statistics, and it still hasn\u2019t returned to pre-recession levels.

{"label": "pants-fire", "claim": "Newt Gingrich Says the congressional ethics investigation against him was conducted by \"a very partisan political committee\" in a way that \"related more to the politics of the Democratic Party than to ethics.\"", "evidence": "During a Dec. 6, 2011, interview on Fox News, Greta Van Susteren asked Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich for his view about a comment House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., had made a few days earlier.\n\nOn Dec. 5, the liberal website Talking Points Memo published an exchange with Pelosi, who, like Gingrich, has previously served as House speaker. In an article headlined, \"Democrats Gleeful At Prospect Of Running Against Gingrich,\" Talking Points Memo quoted Pelosi saying of the fast-rising Republican presidential hopeful, \"One of these days we\u2019ll have a conversation about Newt Gingrich. I know a lot about him. I served on the investigative committee that investigated him, four of us locked in a room in an undisclosed location for a year. A thousand pages of his stuff.\"\n\nPelosi added -- jokingly, according to the website -- that she would elaborate \"when the time\u2019s right.\"\n\nLater, Gingrich responded by calling the taunt from Pelosi -- who\u2019s as much a bogeyman for Republicans as Gingrich is for Democrats -- \"an early Christmas gift. It tells you how capriciously political (the House ethics) committee was that she was on it. It tells you how tainted the outcome was that she was on it.\"\n\nGingrich elaborated during his Fox News interview.\n\nVan Susteren brought it up by asking him whether, \"in sort of seriousness, this could be rather punishing in a race when someone comes up and says something like, I have secret information about the person.\"\n\nGingrich responded that he doubted Pelosi had any secret information to release, since the case had been thoroughly aired in public and because it would likely be illegal to disclose anything that had been purposely kept secret at the time. But Gingrich took the opportunity to link Pelosi to the investigation and cite it as evidence of how the process had been biased in a partisan way.\n\nThe back-and-forth with Pelosi \"reminds people who probably didn't know that she was on the ethics committee, that it was a very partisan political committee and that the way I was dealt with related more to the politics of the Democratic Party than to ethics. And I think in that sense, it actually helps me in getting people to understand, this was a Nancy Pelosi-driven effort. They filed 85 charges and 84 were dismissed. The only one was a conflicting lawyer's letter. And then the Democrats just held out for partisan reasons.\"\n\nFor this item, we\u2019re focusing on the claim that the ethics investigation against Gingrich was conducted by \"a very partisan political committee\" in a way that \"related more to the politics of the Democratic Party than to ethics.\"\n\nGingrich has a long history with the congressional ethics process, both as an accuser (most famously against Democratic House Speaker Jim Wright, who resigned amid ethics charges Gingrich promoted in 1989) and as the accused.\n\nThe case primarily involved a course at Kennesaw State College that Gingrich taught while in Congress. The organizers of the course solicited financial support from \"individuals, corporations and foundations,\" promising that the project qualified for tax-exempt status. But the ethics committee concluded that the course was \"actually a coordinated effort\" to \"help in achieving a partisan, political goal\" -- something that would run afoul of its tax exempt status. A further problem for Gingrich was that during the investigation, he submitted letters from his lawyers for which \"the subcommittee was unable to find any factual basis.\" Gingrich \"should have known\" that the information in the letters \"was inaccurate, incomplete, and unreliable.\"\nThe allegations were largely ajudicated by January 1997, with Gingrich agreeing to pay a sum of $300,000 and admitting that he had \"engaged in conduct that did not reflect creditably on the House of Representatives.\" He became the first speaker to be sanctioned in this fashion by the House. (Here\u2019s a time line of the case.)\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted before, Gingrich\u2019s intensely partisan style and his heavy use of the congressional ethics process ramped up the level of partisan warfare during his investigation. Few observers would disagree that Democrats were gleeful at the prospect of seeing the first Republican House speaker in four decades brought down by ethics charges analagous to those Gingrich himself had used to topple Wright.\n\nBut in the interview with Van Susteren, Gingrich did more than just say that partisan warriors leveraged his investigation for their own ends. He said that the investigation against him was itself conducted by \"a very partisan political committee\" in a way that \"related more to the politics of the Democratic Party than to ethics.\"\n\nIn essence, Gingrich is alleging that the investigation of his actions was biased by partisanship and, by extension, that the penalty he agreed to was tainted.\n\nTo understand whether Gingrich\u2019s assertion is correct requires a look at the venue for the investigation -- the House ethics committee, which was then known officially as the Standards of Official Conduct Committee.\n\nThe ethics panel is the only House committee with an even number of Republicans and Democrats. By longstanding tradition, the committee does not proceed with a formal investigation unless it has majority support. This means that every ethics case that moves forward -- including Gingrich\u2019s -- required the vote of at least least one member from the same party as the lawmaker facing allegations.\n\nIn Gingrich\u2019s case, an investigative subcommittee was convened and looked into the case for several months. Like the full committee, it included an equal number of Democrats and Republicans, and it hired a special counsel, James M. Cole, to lead the investigation. (Cole was later appointed deputy attorney general by President Barack Obama, but at the time of his appointment in the Gingrich case, Cole had worked as a Justice Department attorney in administrations of both parties.) Gingrich had legal representation during the ethics process.\n\nOn Dec. 21, 1996, the subcommittee forwarded its findings to the full committee for consideration, recommending \"a reprimand and the payment of $300,000 toward the cost of the preliminary inquiry.\"\n\nOn Jan. 17, 1997, the full committee held nearly six hours of televised hearings before voting 7 to 1 to accept the subcommittee\u2019s recommendation. Voting to accept it were three Republicans -- Chairwoman Nancy Johnson of Connecticut, Steve Schiff of New Mexico and Porter Goss of Florida.\n\n\"We are bringing to the floor a very tough penalty, an appropriate one,\" Johnson said in an interview on NBC\u2019s Today show on Jan. 21, 1997, the day the ethics recommendation went to the House floor. \"And we're bringing it to the floor as a bipartisan committee.\"\n\nThe full House went on to pass the ethics report 395 to 28, with 196 Republicans voting for it and just 26 voting against it.\n\n\"This is a tough penalty,\" Johnson said after the vote, according to the Washington Post. \"I believe it is an appropriate penalty. It demonstrates that nobody is above the rules.\"\n\nSchiff added in a press conference the same day that \"being bipartisan doesn't mean you always agree on everything. It means you reach a consensus.\"\n\nThis hardly seems like a Democratic kangaroo court to us. And experts we checked with felt the same.\n\n\"The process had plenty of partisan tension, because he was the speaker,\" said Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar with the American Enterprise Institute. But Cole, the special counsel, \"was terrific and thoroughly objective,\" Ornstein said. To Ornstein, Gingrich \"is sanitizing the process and outcome. To be sure, the charges were not so explosive that he merited a \u2018death penalty\u2019 (of resignation), but the charges were not wildly different or less significant than those he had brought against Jim Wright, who did resign.\"\n\nKenneth A. Gross, the head of the political law practice at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, was one of several experts we spoke to who agreed.\n\n\"I saw that committee at work behind closed doors during that era, and it was certainly divided and partisan, but it is the only committee of Congress that has an equal number of Democrats and Republicans, and for anything to move forward, it would require a bipartisan vote.\"\n\nWe should add that Gingrich accepted what amounted to a negotiated plea bargain. He agreed to admit one count of wrongdoing and pay $300,000, which was the estimated cost of the investigation.

Supporters of Prop 60 say the initiative would strengthen the existing law, which they say is rarely enforced.\nThe measure is sponsored by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which has long pushed for greater safety standards in adult films.\nIn 2012, voters in Los Angeles County approved a similar condom requirement for adult films made in that county. It is considered a model for Prop 60, which applies its condom mandate to scenes with anal and vaginal intercourse.\nProp 60 would also require adult film companies to obtain a health license and pay for the costs of vaccinations and health tests for sexually transmitted diseases for their performers.\nWe asked the No on 60 campaign for evidence backing up its claim that performers would be open to lawsuits under the measure. A spokesman pointed to the initiative\u2019s section 6720.6, on enforcement, whistleblowers and private rights of action.\nIt allows those who witness violations of the proposed law -- including performers, prosecutors or anyone who is a California resident -- to file a complaint with the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health. If the agency declines to pursue the case within 21 days, the witness could then file a civil lawsuit against anyone with a financial interest in the film, which could include some performers.\nThere\u2019s no mention in the No on 60 advertisement, however, that only performers with a financial interest would be liable.\u00a0Nor does the ad mention the complaint process that must precede a lawsuit.\n\n\n"}

Dana Wachs, D-Eau Claire, that Walker's \"listening sessions\" were \"invite-only and excluding the press.\"\nAs he traveled Wisconsin to meet with residents, Walker asked various people, including Democratic lawmakers, for suggestions on who to invite to his listening sessions. But these events -- held by Walker, rather than him attending events staged by others -- were not open to the public or to the press, only to people who were invited.\nNow the 2018 campaign for governor is in full swing, with Wachs among seven Democrats hoping to challenge Walker.

They need to lose their next election. We have been betrayed.\"\nA reader recently sent us the dispatch and asked if it is true. We took a look, mindful that Warner, a Democrat, is up for reelection this fall.\nNo group or individual takes credit for the email, which denounces the Arms Trade Treaty adopted by the U.N.\u2019s General Assembly on April 2, 2013. The vote was 154 in favor, 3 opposed and 23 absent. The U.S. voted for it, while North Korea, Iran and Syria opposed it.\nThe treaty, which took seven years to negotiate, is aimed at restricting the international flow of large and small arms to nations beset by terrorists or dictators with poor human rights records. President Barack Obama said he would sign the pact. But before the U.S. can be bound by any treaty, the agreement must be approved by the Senate.\nThe U.N. treaty had long been opposed by the National Rifle Association and many other pro-gun groups, who said it could infringe on constitutional rights to own arms in the United States. Before the U.N\u2019s approval of the accord, the Senate passed legislation, by a 53-46 vote, stating opposition to the treaty. Warner and Kaine voted with the minority that favored the pact.\nThe email says that the treaty, in addition to allowing the U.N. to seize guns, \"would have effectively placed a global ban on the import and export of small firearms. The ban would have affected all private gun owners in the U.S. and had language that would have implemented an international gun registry, now get this, on all private guns and ammo.\"\nFacts about the treaty\nLet\u2019s look at the what the treaty actually does. It states its purpose is to \"establish the highest possible common international standards for regulating or improving the regulation of the international trade in conventional arms\" and to \"prevent and eradicate the illicit trade in conventional arms and prevent their diversion.\"\nIt requires each participating country to establish its own controls over the export of ammunition and conventional arms. The pact prohibits sending the weapons to nations that are under a U.N. arms embargo or where the arms will be used for terrorism, genocide, crimes against humanity, breaches of the Geneva Conventions, attacks against civilians or other war crimes. The treaty calls on participating nations to take \"appropriate measures\" if they determine that a shipment has been diverted, although it does not clearly define those steps.\n\n"}

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Jeff Merkley Says allowing the payroll tax holiday to expire would end up \"costing another estimated 900,000 jobs in 2012.\"", "evidence": "With all the intense interest on Congress during the debt ceiling debate and with all the nervous tics from people watching the near-death process, there\u2019s little surprise that Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley\u2019s decision to vote against the final deal drew reaction from his constituents.\n\nThe debt agreement passed 74-26, of course, but Merkley was one of only six Democrats voting against a deal that prevented the United States from defaulting on its financial obligations for the first time in history.\n\nIn explaining his vote, Merkley offered some general observations about the impact on people, especially the middle class.\n\n\"I voted against the deal because, in short, I felt that it would make it harder for middle class Oregonians to get ahead now and in the future,\" he said in an Aug. 3 letter to a constituent in Hillsboro.\n\n\"I have a single, simple measure to evaluate this proposal: is it going to create greater opportunities for prosperity and success for working Americans? \u00a0Unfortunately, I have concluded that it will not, and so I cannot support it,\" Merkley said.\n\nPretty general stuff.\n\nBut he also offered a specific complaint - that the deal could slow down federal spending at the same time other government efforts to stimulate the economy are also ending, including the payroll tax holiday. Merkley says that\u2019s a recipe for worsening the job picture at the very time when jobs are most needed.\n\nHe backs his claim with numbers, which always gets our juices flowing here at PolitiFact Oregon.\n\nAllowing the payroll tax holiday to expire Dec. 31 is a terrible choice, he says in the letter, \"costing another estimated 900,000 jobs in 2012.\"\n\nThat tax cut lowers Social Security payroll taxes paid by employees to 4.2 percent of earnings from 6.2 percent.\n\nThe economic argument Merkley makes is well known: that the extra $1,000 on average a family will have because of the payroll tax holiday will be spent. That means more money in circulation, which means more products produced and sold, which means more demand and more jobs. But is his claim correct about jobs connected to the payroll tax holiday?\n\nFor support, Merkley cites an Aug. 1, 2011, analysis by economist John S. Irons at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.\n\n\"Extending that tax cut for another year would provide roughly $118 billion in stimulus through increases in employees\u2019 take-home pay, which would boost economic activity by an even greater $128 billion, Irons writes. \"Allowing this policy to expire would lower GDP by 0.8 percent in 2012, and would lead to roughly 972,000 fewer jobs.\"\n\nWhile other economists have come to similar conclusions, absolute truth is impossible to obtain. Many factors affect economic performance -- including such wild-cards as weather and market psychology.\n\nHoward Gleckman, the editor of a tax blog for the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, has this to say about extending the payroll tax holiday:\n\n\"Obama wants to extend this year\u2019s payroll tax holiday. That may help keep consumer demand afloat. But since we don\u2019t know what households have been doing with the extra cash they got this year, it is hard to predict what will happen if the holiday is extended.\"\n\nThe payroll tax is scheduled to go back up Jan. 1, unless Congress renews it.\n\nIf it is extended, the payroll tax holiday would mean $400 for the year for workers who make $20,000; $800 for workers who make $40,000; and $2,000 for workers who make $100,000. Social Security taxes only apply to income up to $106,800, so the measure particularly benefits workers below that threshold who, most economists say, are more likely to spend it.\n\nMerkley\u2019s analysis conforms with traditional economic thinking and he is supported by actual calculations from economists. But questions of cause and effect in the economy always must be qualified as simply best educated guesses. Merkley adds the proper fudge in his letter, saying the job loss totals are estimates.

Kaptur voted yes; Kucinich voted no.\n\nThe 19 projects are all directed spending, or earmarks, for Ohio. We confirmed them on the LegiStorm database using information from the group Taxpayers for Common Sense.\n\nThey were sponsored by Kaptur alone or with other members of the Ohio delegation, including Republicans and Democrats. Kucinich co-sponsored one of the appropriations, $2 million for research on renewable hydrocarbon fuels for military applications, at the Edison Materials Technology Center in Toledo.\n\nThe earmarks totaled more than $59 million in our count.\n\n\"We used a conservative estimate,\" Kaptur spokesman Steve Fought said.\n\nIn response, Kucinich campaign spokesman Andy Juniewicz noted something else about the military spending act.\n\n\"The principal provisions of that bill included $127.3 billion in additional defense spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,\" he said.\n\nThough the measure also included \"a host of other, non-defense-related expenditures,\" he said, Kucinich voted against it as a long-time opponent of the wars.\n\n\"He has urged for years that those wars be ended and the troops brought home, and that the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent there be re-directed to support crucial domestic needs, including re-building the nation's infrastructure, improving education, and meeting the health care needs of the uninsured and under-insured,\" Juniewicz said. \"For Kaptur to misrepresent his anti-war vote as a vote against new manufacturing jobs in Northern Ohio is, plainly and deliberately, dishonest.\"\n\nKaptur's campaign called it \"a matter of how you characterize the votes.\"\n\n\"Those projects were in that bill, and Kucinich voted against them, including one of the projects he had sponsored,\" Fought said. \"He wants to characterize it as an anti-war vote and not an anti-jobs vote.\n\n\"In Congress you don't get to cherry pick on legislation. He wants to have it both ways. It's a matter of whether you take responsibility for your final vote or not.\"\n\nWe think characterization is an issue on both sides.\n\nKaptur\u2019s statement is partially accurate. Kucinich did vote against the legislation containing the earmarks. But there are important details missing from the claim.\n\nWhile the measures sponsored by Kaptur were, in fact, appropriations for work to be done on projects in Ohio, her campaign omits important information by characterizing earmarks in the defense budget simply as money \"for new manufacturing jobs.\"\n\nAlso, legislators frequently face the dilemma of having to vote against programs they would normally support because they are so opposed to other provisions in the same piece of legislation.\n\nKaptur and Kucinich are longtime colleagues in the House. As such, Kaptur certainly is well aware of Kucinich\u2019s steadfast opposition to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. His vote in this case is consistent with that position.\n\nCharacterizing his vote as opposition to spending on programs that could create jobs is simply misleading"}

Kean appointed Lautenberg to complete the final days of the term.\n\nLautenberg started his first full term in January 1983 and served three six-year terms before leaving Washington, D.C. when he decided not to seek re-election.\n\nBut he returned to Capitol Hill two years later in 2003 after replacing fellow Democrat Robert Torricelli on the ballot. Torricelli, who had served one term, quit his re-election bid in 2002 a month before voters headed to the polls because of questions about his ethics.

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Marco Rubio \"There are at least three sectors of the border, one in particular, that are just completely insecure.\"", "evidence": "Sen. Marco Rubio said he\u2019s learned some lessons from his first failed foray into the immigration policy game.\n\"What I\u2019ve learned, is you can\u2019t even have a conversation about that until people believe and know \u2014 not just believe, but it\u2019s proven to them \u2014 that future illegal immigration will controlled,\" Rubio said. \"That is the single biggest lesson of the last two years.\"\nA big piece of that, Rubio said, is border security, and he gave this stat: \"There are at least three sectors of the border, one in particular, that are just completely insecure.\"\nThe southwest border spans from San Diego to the southern tip of Texas, and it is broken into nine sectors. Are at least three of those sectors \"completely insecure\"? We decided to check.\nWhat is \u2018secure\u2019?\nBorder patrol agents have many duties, of which stopping illegal migration is one. They also have to prevent drugs and weapons trafficking across the border, thwart potential terrorist plots, stop money laundering, among other tasks.\nAs it is, there\u2019s no set definition for what constitutes a \"secure\" border, experts told us. If you think one failure to apprehend a border crosser means a sector is insecure, then the whole border lacks security. That\u2019s unreasonable. But where do you draw the line for what constitutes \"secure.\"\nAdditionally, we don\u2019t know exactly what percentage of people successfully cross the border, nor how many successful drug running missions there are each year, etc. We can measure how many are caught in the act, but that\u2019s only one part of the equation. So when Rubio says the border is \"completely insecure,\" that\u2019s not really grounded in any set metric.\nWe asked Rubio\u2019s office to explain what he meant by \"completely insecure\" and which three border sectors he was referring to. Spokeswoman Brooke Sammon did not respond to our multiple emails and calls.\nMeasuring sector security\nA Government Accountability Office report from 2011 on border control measures broke down how much of each sector in 2010 was under \"operational control.\"\nThat means agents had the ability to apprehend violators upon or immediately after entry.\nHere\u2019s what they found.\n\nFour sectors obviously stick out for their lack of operational control: Marfa (now called Big Bend), Del Rio, Laredo and Rio Grande Valley. All four achieved operational control for less than 40 percent of their respective sector.\nAgain, this data is from 2010, so it\u2019s unclear how those sectors of the border have fared since. At the time, operational control of the border had been increasing by 126 miles annually dating back to 2005 and more resources have been put toward the border since. Additionally, these are based on qualitative assessments.\nAlso, the Department of Homeland Security scrapped them because they don\u2019t provide much useful information for determining the effectiveness of border security in a particular sector. It hasn\u2019t replaced it with anything more useful yet, said Theresa Brown, director of immigration policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center.\nThe Bipartisan Policy Center tracks an effectiveness rate for each sector based on the number of apprehensions and turnbacks versus \"got aways,\" meaning border patrol agents found evidence (security footage, tracks, etc.) that someone made it through.\nHere are the center\u2019s most recent calculations for Fiscal Year 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\nSector\n\n\nApprehensions\n\n\nTurnbacks\n\n\nGot aways\n\n\nEffectiveness\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBig Bend\n\n\n3,493\n\n\n160\n\n\n1,757\n\n\n67.52 percent\n\n\n\n\nDel Rio\n\n\n20,904\n\n\n4,287\n\n\n5,157\n\n\n83.01 percent\n\n\n\n\nEl Centro\n\n\n15,725\n\n\n3,688\n\n\n2,779\n\n\n87.48 percent\n\n\n\n\nEl Paso\n\n"}

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Bob Goodlatte The\u00a0House\u00a0budget plan proposes \"the largest discretionary spending cut in history.\"", "evidence": "The U.S government got a three-week lease on life Thursday as Congress passed yet another stopgap that will fund federal operations through April 8.\n\nBut the threat of a shutdown still lurks as Republicans and Democrats remain deadlocked on the magnitude of spending cuts for the 2011 federal budget, which runs through Sept.30.\n\nU.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, a Republican from Roanoke, supported deep budget cuts approved by the GOP-led House on Feb 19. In a column\u00a0posted on his website six days later, Goodlatte said the bill cuts $100 billion.\n\n\"This represents the largest discretionary spending cut in history,\" Goodlatte said.\n\nKathryn Rexrode, a spokeswoman for Goodlatte, said her boss\u2019 statement has been widely uttered by interest groups and members of Congress, including Rep. Hal Rogers, R-Ky, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nWe wondered if the cuts would be truly historic.\n\nFirst, an important detail: The $100 billion figure that Goodlatte and other Republicans are using represents the amount the House would ax from President Barack Obama\u2019s 2011 budget proposal. Budget analysts from conservative and liberal organizations told us it is more meaningful to say the House proposal would cut spending by $61 billion, which is the amount it would excise from the 2010 federal budget.\n\nThe Senate, by contrast, wants to pare $10.5 billion from last year\u2019s budget.\n\nSo our goal is to see whether U.S. discretionary spending was ever reduced by more than $61 billion from one budget to the next.\n\nDiscretionary spending is the money the federal government pays out through a dozen or so appropriation bills Congress approves each year. It adds up to about 40 percent of the national budget \u00a0and includes a variety of services such as defense, law enforcement, transportation and national parks.\n\nIf you\u2019re curious, non-discretionary spending largely refers to three benefit programs Congress is required to fund at certain levels: social security, Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nWe didn\u2019t go back to the 1st Congress in 1789 to determine whether the proposed spending cut is indeed historic. The annual federal budget did not exceed $61 billion -- the amount the House wants to cut this year -- until 1943.\n\nWe analyzed spreadsheets\u00a0from the Office of Management and Budget. To roughly compute discretionary spending each year since 1943, we took the total budget outlay and subtracted the costs of Social Security and interest payments on government loans. The nation began paying for Medicare and Medicaid in the 1966 budget so starting that year, we also subtracted the cost of those programs.\n\nThe largest reductions came after World War II as the U.S. was returning to peace. Discretionary spending dropped by about $38.5 billion in 1946 about $21 billion in 1947 -- entirely because of defense cuts.\n\nThere have been a few other years when discretionary funding has dipped by smaller amounts: in the mid 1950s after the Korean War and in 1965. The feat was last accomplished in 1996, when discretionary spending dropped\u00a0$12.1 billion.\n\n"}

{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Michael Sullivan Says public education will get more money in 2012-13 though lawmakers cut $15 billion in overall spending.", "evidence": "State Comptroller Susan Combs, whose duties include oversight of state finances, delivered a contradictory assessment of how Texas lawmakers treated public schools while writing the state budget in 2011.\n\nAccording to a news story in the Bryan-College Station Eagle, Combs was asked by a local audience member on April 4, 2012, how much the state cut from public education. The story says Combs replied that the state didn't reduce funding, instead adding $2 billion.\n\n\"It was not less, but it was not as much,\" Combs said, according to the story, which we learned of from an April 6, 2012, Twitter post by state Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin. His accompanying message described Combs\u2019 not less-but not as much statement as the \"effort to hide education budget cuts, in 1 sentence.\"\n\nBefore gauging Combs\u2019 claim, we tried to pin down what she said.\n\nHer spokesman, RJ DeSilva, told us her appearance was not recorded by the comptroller\u2019s office. Separately, when we inquired, Eagle education reporter Cassie Smith sent us her notes from the event, which indicate that Combs said both that school funding was not cut and that there was not as much funding as lawmakers or the state would have spent.\n\nAccording to the notes, an attendee asked: \"How much did we actually cut funding from public education?\"\n\nCombs: \"Well, we didn\u2019t actually cut it. I think the number was that we actually put in about $2 billion, if my recollections from what I read, but it was not the amount that they would have spent. So it was not less, but it was not as much. What happened was schools have to take a look at what do we do with staff. What do we do with expenditures? What do we do with various things? I know there\u2019s been a debate about it.\"\n\nSmith\u2019s notes say two local school superintendents then chimed in with how much less they\u2019ll be receiving.\n\nCombs: \"OK.\"\n\nThen, Smith\u2019s notes say, Combs \u00a0started talking about community colleges and graduation rates.\n\nConfirmed: Combs said that funding to school districts was not cut.\n\nAnd is that correct?\n\nDeSilva told us by email that Combs\u2019 claim reflected figures in the Legislative Budget Board\u2019s January 2012 \"Fiscal Size-up\" report for the current budget period, 2012-13. The report shows lawmakers put about $150 million more in state revenue into public education than was appropriated in 2010-11. Also, DeSilva said, Combs was referring to the decision to defer a $2.3 billion payment otherwise due to school districts in the current budget period to September 2013.\n\nDeSilva said Combs\u2019 published comment -- \"It was not less, but it was not as much\" -- reflected the fact that changes to the state\u2019s school funding formula \"meant districts would be entitled to an estimated $4 billion less than they would have been entitled to had school finance formulas remained unchanged... So while\" state \"funding went up, schools would have received more funding if the formula had not changed,\" DeSilva said.\n\nOur takeaway: Combs says that lawmakers put more state revenue into education, yet changed finance formulas so schools would get $4 billion less than if the formulas had stayed the same and also deferred a regular payment to school districts to the next budget.\n\nThe latter two points are factually solid, covering territory that we crossed in checking a legislator\u2019s claim about education funding, though the deferred payment strikes us as more indicative of less education aid in the current budget period.\n\nHowever, the $150 million state spending increase relied upon by Combs delivers an incomplete picture of what lawmakers spent. The state\u2019s \"general revenue\" increase pales in comparison to reductions in other funds appropriated for public education. Notably, $3.3 billion in one-time federal stimulus aid that legislators used in 2009 to cover some of the state\u2019s tab for basic school aid was not available in 2011.\n\nMeanwhile, public education funding from all sources in the 2012-13 state budget decreased $2.8 billion, or 5.6 percent, as the federal stimulus aid went away, according to the 2012 Fiscal Size-up.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nResults in individual school districts would vary, but an accurate broad answer to the audience member\u2019s question about school funding cuts would be that the schools sustained a legislated reduction in education funding adding up to more than $5 billion through 2012-13, a total that rolls in the $4 billion in reductions of formula-driven aid plus other cuts in targeted programs such as teacher incentive pay, dropout prevention funding and zeroed-out grants to the pre-Kindergarten Early Start program.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOur ruling\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nLawmakers cut public school aid, mainly by changing an established funding formula and reducing aid to targeted programs. To say otherwise is inaccurate, misleading and by a wide margin ridiculous. Pants on Fire!\n\n"}

By that measure, the U.S. achieved independence in 2019 for the full year, and stayed that way through last year.\u00a0\nIf consumption were ultimately to top production for the year again, that would take the U.S. back to where it was in 2018, not 1957, and not back 50 years.\nBut the government hasn\u2019t published full-year data yet for 2020, or any results for 2021.

Production of crude oil and natural gas reached record highs in 2019, the federal agency said.\nU.S. energy producers scaled back in 2020 in response to the pandemic. But consumption fell even faster amid the recession. So for the first 10 months of 2020, the latest period for which composite data are available, energy production still exceeded consumption.\nThe EIA says trends for this year will depend on the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and the speed of the U.S. economic recovery.

In the spot, Cobb faces the camera and says: \"You trusted me to take on Tom DeLay \u2014 and we won.\" By email, Jeff Crosby, an adviser to candidate Margaret Moore, noted that while a local jury found DeLay guilty, his convictions were thrown out on appeal.\nWe asked Katie Naranjo, a consultant to Cobb\u2019s campaign, about Cobb\u2019s victory statement.\nBy email, Naranjo told us Cobb \"was entrusted as lead trial lawyer\" in DeLay\u2019s trial \"and Gary (and his trial team, other attorneys, investigators and support staff\u2014that is, \u2018we\u2019) won the trial.\"\nNaranjo acknowledged the convictions were overturned. Still, she wrote, \"Gary was not the appellate lawyer, which was another team. Trial lawyers often win a trial, and then that result might get overturned on appeal. That doesn\u2019t mean that the trial lawyers didn\u2019t win the trial.\"\nNews accounts\nLet\u2019s revisit the DeLay turning points as depicted in Statesman news stories, starting with the trial.\nIn November 2010, eight years after the county launched its investigation, a jury found DeLay, then 63, guilty of laundering corporate money into political donations during the 2002 elections. His indictment on the charges earlier led him to give up the leadership post; next, he left the House.\nFrom the Statesman account of the verdict:\nDeLay, a Republican whose nickname was \"The Hammer\" because of his heavy-handed leadership style, was accused of conspiring to funnel $190,000 of corporate money through the Republican National Committee, which sent $190,000 in campaign donations to seven GOP candidates for the Texas House.\nProsecutors argued that DeLay conspired to launder corporate money into political donations as the first step in creating a GOP majority in the Texas House. It later redrew the state's congressional districts to favor Republicans, which prosecutors said bolstered DeLay's hold on his leadership post in Washington.\nState law prohibits corporations from giving donations to candidates directly or indirectly. Prosecutors earlier said they thought the DeLay case is the first such criminal charge ever filed over the state's century-old law on corporate contributions in state political races.\nIn January 2011, DeLay was sentenced to three years in prison. But he also was released on a $10,000 bond pending appeals avowed by his lead trial lawyer, Dick DeGuerin.\n\n"}

Buckles provided us with the\u00a0Eighth Broadband Progress Report\u00a0compiled by the Federal Communications Commission and released on Aug. 14, 2012. The report was also included in the news release, via hyperlink. \u00a0\n\n\nAccording to these 2012 numbers, Hartzler\u2019s statement about rural residents is correct: some 24.2 percent of Missourians living in rural areas don't have access to high-speed internet. However, in her tweet she noted that one-fifth of all Missourians don\u2019t have access to high-speed internet. This figure is inaccurate, according to the 2012 report, which says that 7.5 percent of the total state population doesn't have access to high-speed internet.\n\n\nThe problem gets worse, though. The 2012 report provided by Buckles used an outdated benchmark internet speed. Measured in megabits per second, or mbps, the speed of an internet connection is a measurement of data transfer. The first number refers to the download speed, which is how fast your connection can retrieve data from the server, and the second number refers to the upload speed, which is how fast you can deliver data to the server.\n\n\nThe benchmark number for high-speed internet used by the old FCC report is 4mbps/1mbps.\u00a0The 2016 FCC Broadband Progress Report\u00a0has a benchmark of 25mbps/3mbps.\n\n\nThe raised benchmark has drastically reframed the picture of access to high-speed internet in Missouri.\n\n\nFaster internet\n\n\nAccording to the 2016 report, 1,257,622 Missourians\u00a0\u2014 or one-fifth of the state population \u2014 don\u2019t have access to high-speed internet.

Conservative radio talk show host Charlie Sykes tapped into that theme during his regular morning show on WTMJ in Milwaukee. He teed it up by explaining why the American taxpayer was the \"loser of the day.\"\n\"According to the new census data, the number of Americans who receive means-tested government benefits -- welfare -- now outnumbers those who are year-round full-time workers,\" Sykes said. \"Wow. We\u2019ve been struggling, but in terms of the tipping point here, where you have more people who are on these benefit programs, these are the means-tested benefit programs, than the people who are actually working and paying the taxes.\"\nIn this fact-check, we\u2019ll look into whether today there are more people getting these benefits than there are full-time workers. By the way, means-tested applies to aid that comes only if the person is poor enough to qualify. The programs include Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps), subsidized housing and several others which we\u2019ll mention below.\nWe asked Sykes where he got his information and he sent us a link to an article that appeared on the CNS News website. CNS News is a project of the Media Research Center, a conservative group that aims to counter what it sees as liberal bias in the media.\nThe CNS News item accurately cited two reports from the Census Bureau. One report gave the number of 108 million people receiving at least one means-tested benefit. The other gave the number of 101 million people who work full time.\nThe math seems simple, but those reports don\u2019t tell the entire story. Here\u2019s why.\nCensus Bureau includes double counting\nThe original CNS article links to the key Census Bureau tables. The table on recipients of means-tested aid has this note at the top. \"The figures for means-tested programs include anyone residing in a household in which one or more people received benefits from the program.\"\nSo, if one person receives Supplemental Security Income, a program for disabled adults, the entire household was included in the tally. As a result, it was possible for full-time workers to be counted as recipients.\nAnother table in the same data collection gives an idea of how common that might be. Out of a total of more than 108 million recipients, there were more than 79 million households with at least one person working. The data don\u2019t say whether that was a full-time worker but the numbers guarantee that the tally of recipients is exaggerated.\nTime frame\nSykes said this was a situation that exists \"now,\" but what is interesting is the article is very clear that this information is from 2011. Here\u2019s the article\u2019s first line: \"Americans who were recipients of means-tested government benefits in 2011 outnumbered year-round full-time workers, according to data released this month by the Census Bureau,\" it said.\nSykes spoke about a situation that he said existed today. The economy in 2011 is not the one we have in 2013. Among other big differences, unemployment is lower by 1.4 percentage points.\nUpdating the numbers\nWe went to several agency websites to determine what their participation figures look like today. In every case that we could check, they had declined.\n\n"}

And it's a terrible thing, but I think the investigation and all the speculation that's happened over the past two years has had a much harsher impact on our democracy than a couple of Facebook ads.\"\nKushner\u2019s entitled to his opinion on impact, but his characterization of Russia\u2019s activity during the 2016 political season is wrong. \"Buying some Facebook ads to try and sow dissent\" is starkly at odds with the U.S. government\u2019s description of the Kremlin\u2019s \"active measures\" campaign, which officials concluded was carried out to help Trump and hurt Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.\nRussia sought to help Trump win the White House\nUltimately, Mueller did not establish there was an illegal relationship between the Trump campaign and Russia. But the notion that Moscow\u2019s efforts amounted to \"a couple of Facebook ads\" is belied by the factual record Mueller compiled, as well as the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s assessment.\nRussia\u2019s active measures campaign comprised two major efforts. The first was a multi-platform social media campaign, which Kushner downplayed as the purchase of \"a couple of Facebook ads.\" The second was the hacking and disseminating of Democratic materials to harm Clinton\u2019s electoral chances.\n\"The investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome,\" Mueller\u2019s report notes.\nMueller\u2019s conclusion came after the U.S. intelligence community publicly announced a similar conclusion after the 2016 vote.\n\"We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump,\" the Jan. 2017 U.S. intelligence assessment states. \"When it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign then focused on undermining her expected presidency.\"\nRussia\u2019s social media campaign\nThe scope of Russia\u2019s social media campaign went vastly further than Kushner\u2019s claim of \"a couple of Facebook ads.\"\nA Kremlin-backed entity called the Internet Research Agency, or IRA, ran the social media campaign out of St. Petersburg, Russia. Mueller found that by the end of the 2016 U.S. election, \"the IRA had the ability to reach millions of U.S. persons through their social media accounts.\"\nThe IRA purchased over 3,500 Facebook advertisements and spent some\u00a0$100,000 on the political ads, the report states. The group also\u00a0controlled multiple Facebook groups and Instagram accounts that \"had hundreds of thousands of U.S. participants,\" Mueller said.\nAbout a year after the election, a Facebook executive told Congress that the IRA controlled some 470 accounts that generated 80,000 posts between January 2015 and August 2017.\nBut the biggest statistic concerns the length of its reach.\n\"Facebook estimated the IRA reached as many as 126 million persons through its Facebook accounts,\" the Mueller report states.\n\n"}

State Rep. Rich Golick, R-Smyrna, a co-sponsor of the bill, asked Raynor. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\"I don\u2019t have it, Mr. Chairman, in front of me today. I know we\u2019ve seen quotes from different reports that have shown anywhere from 50 percent all the way up to in excess of 80,\" Raynor replied.\n\nThat same day, Gov. Nathan Deal noted \"there are questions being raised\" about E-Verify\u2019s accuracy.\n\nSounds bad, we thought. So, are there inaccuracies in E-Verify?\n\nHouse Bill 87 and Senate Bill 40 would require many businesses to use E-Verify, which handled more than 16 million queries during fiscal year 2010, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. SB 40 exempts farmers and other employers who participate in federal programs that allow noncitizens to work here legally.\n\nAn employer enters a new hire\u2019s information, which E-Verify tries to match with records from the Social Security Administration and the DHS. If there\u2019s a match and the worker is authorized, the employee stays.\n\nIf there\u2019s no match, the system issues a \"tentative nonconfirmation,\" which the employee can contest. If that challenge is unsuccessful, E-Verify issues a \"final nonconfirmation,\" and the employee can be fired. \u00a0\n\nE-Verify, which was originally named the \"Basic Pilot Program,\" is mandatory for federal contractors and employers in Arizona, Mississippi, South Carolina and Utah. In Georgia, public agencies and employers with public contracts must use it. \u00a0\n\nNow, on to our analysis. A chamber spokeswoman referred us to Kim Thompson, an Atlanta labor attorney who advises the chamber on E-Verify.\n\n\"I wouldn\u2019t say the problems are necessarily significant, but there are problems,\" Thompson said. She said she has handled cases in which E-Verify failed to confirm legal workers, but the program\u2019s accuracy has recently improved. \u00a0\n\nThompson referred PolitiFact Georgia to the federal Government Accountability Office, which issued a report on the program in December, plus an audit of the program by independent contractor Westat, a research company.\n\nIndeed, the GAO and experts for and against making E-Verify mandatory agree that the program has improved. It\u2019s overwhelmingly accurate for authorized workers, but it fails to catch a large percentage of illegal ones. \u00a0\n\nThe most current data says that overall, it was inaccurate between 2.3 and 5.7 percent of the time, according to Westat. \u00a0\n\nFor legal workers, its error rate was between 0.6 percent and 1 percent, Westat found. But of the workers it thought may be unauthorized, 22 percent were actually legal.\n\nE-Verify mistook legal, foreign-born workers for illegal ones 20 percent more often than it did for their U.S.-born counterparts, according to Westat. The system especially struggled with workers with Hispanic and Arab surnames, which means \"increased potential exists for an adverse impact on individuals\u2019 civil rights and civil liberties,\" the GAO warned.\n\nLos Angeles County, which used the program, had a harder time with E-Verify. There, it was wrong 2 percent of the time, and 95 percent of the people it thought may be illegal workers turned out to be legal, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration think tank that thinks mandating E-Verify may do more harm than good.\n\nE-Verify\u2019s biggest shortcoming was catching illegal workers. It cleared them to work an estimated 37 to 64 percent of the time. Illegal workers and shady employers often use fraudulent documents that E-Verify can\u2019t detect, the GAO said.\n\nWhether E-Verify is accurate enough to be mandated is up for debate.\n\n\"I would say that if it\u2019s not ready now, it\u2019s on the cusp of being ready,\" said Janice Kephart, an expert with the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration levels. \u00a0\n\nMarc Rosenblum, an immigration expert with the Migration Policy Institute, told PolitiFact Georgia that E-Verify does little for employers since it fails to catch so many unauthorized workers. He concluded in a report this month that \"E-Verify remains vulnerable to identity fraud and employer misuse, and offers no ability to detect off-the-books employment.\"\n\nTo sum up:\n\nE-Verify is overwhelmingly accurate with legal workers but fails to identify a large percentage of illegal ones.\n\nIndeed, as Raynor said, \"there are some inaccuracies that exist\" in E-Verify. But his suggestion the error rate ranges between 50 and 80 percent was too high.\n\nE-Verify\u2019s worst error rate -- for illegal workers -- \u00a0is high, but it\u2019s still well below what Raynor suggested.

The first wasa nearly two-year-old report in the\u00a0Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, which reported that more than 700 Pennsylvanians may have cast two ballots or voted elsewhere in the 2012 general election. In that year, about six million votes were recorded in Pennsylvania, meaning those 700 votes would have accounted for less than 0.0001 percent of the vote. President Obama won the state by 300,000 votes.\nThe story cited Carol Aichele, Pennsylvania\u2019s former Secretary of State and a proponent of the implementation of voter ID laws. (She oversaw its passage in\u00a0Pennsylvania and testified in the trial that ultimately led to the state Supreme Court ruling the measure unconstitutional.) At the time, Aichele told the newspaper that more than 700 Pennsylvania voters had the \"potential\" to cast two ballots in the election.\nExperts say double voting is actually quite rare.\u00a0A report by the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law\u00a0noted that accusations of widespread double voting are often couched with a \"might\" and are probably more common than actual double voting.\n\"These cases are extremely rare \u2014 not because such documentation is hard to come by (many states require that such documents be retained), but because actual double voting is itself extremely rare,\" author Justin Levitt wrote in the report. \"Moreover, the scarcity is expected, given the severity of the penalty (criminal prosecution), and the meager nature of the payoff (one incremental vote).\"\nThe second media report cited by the Rafferty campaign was a January story by\u00a0The Philadelphia Daily News\u00a0about three former Philadelphia elections officials pleading guilty to violating the state election code. The story refers to two separate examples of voter fraud. The first was a case of a poll worker who cast a vote for her 23-year-old son in the 2015 primary. The second stemmed from the 2014 primary, in which the defendant voted for her mother.\n\n"}

It\u2019s the first time the fiscal bureau has determined that a budget would result in such a surplus since the agency began the calculations for the 1997-\u201999 budget.\n\nRepublican Gov. Scott Walker and GOP lawmakers argued that previous administrations used one-time fixes, such as tapping special funds and the state\u2019s settlement in lawsuits against tobacco companies, to balance the budget.\n\nNow, Democrats say the Republicans are making a big assumption -- that their counterparts in Washington will allow a tax increase -- to make the budget picture look better than it really is.\n\nAnd therefore, that the claim of the structural surplus is bogus.\n\nAt issue is how the fiscal bureau handled one piece of its projection: The future reinstatement of the federal estate tax, which -- based on a formula -- brings some additional money to state coffers. Under current law, the estate tax is to kick in again in 2013.\n\nIf that happens, the fiscal bureau estimates it would mean $219 million more for the state over the course of the two-year budget.\n\nAssistant Minority Leader Donna Seidel, D-Wausau, argues the \"$219 million is contingent on Congress reinstating the estate tax, which clearly is a top platform point for the Republicans and is not going to happen.\"\n\n\"So clearly that\u2019s another piece of misinformation,\" Seidel told the Journal Sentinel editorial board July 5, 2011, arguing the structural surplus is closer to $75 million.\n\nWe\u2019ve tackled several recent statements on the structural deficit.\n\nThe first thing to remember is this: The two-year budget itself -- by law -- must be balanced when passed. The structural deficit measures the future imbalance between spending and tax revenue as laid out in state law. So you can have a balanced budget, but one built upon assumptions that are projected to result in a deficit later on.\n\nThat\u2019s part of what happened in the past, leading to structural deficits reaching as high as $2.8 billion for the 2003-\u201905 budget.\n\nWe rated a statement by Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, that the budget eliminated the structural deficit for the \"first time in decades\" as Mostly True. A statement on national TV by Walker that the worst structural deficit was two years ago was False.\n\nThe Fiscal Bureau bases its estimate on factors including expected costs (the spending side), projections of how much the state will collect in sales and income taxes (the revenue side) and other sources of money.\n\nIn this case, that includes what federal law says about the estate tax.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Republicans will push to keep the tax cuts in place -- they already won one extension of the Bush-era tax cuts under President Barack Obama in December of 2010. But Seidel argues it was wrong to include the return of them in the Fiscal Bureau\u2019s calculation.\n\nAssembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, who was with Seidel during the Journal Sentinel visit, agreed with the argument that the surplus isn\u2019t real.\n\n\"There is no surplus,\" he said.\n\nIndeed, as Seidel criticizes the inclusion as an assumption improperly made by the bureau, she is making her own assumption: That the extension of the tax cuts will continue.\n\nHow does the process work?\n\nAs a rule, the fiscal bureau does its calculations based on current law, according to Rob Reinhardt, a program supervisor with the agency. The report on the structural surplus did note the assumption as a footnote.\n\nIndeed, a similar estate tax assumption was used when the fiscal bureau calculated the structural deficit for the 2009-\u201911 budget prepared by Democrat Gov. Jim Doyle. The bureau\u2019s analysis put that budget\u2019s structural deficit at $2.511 billion.\n\nApplying Seidel\u2019s logic to that budget, estate tax revenue should have been subtracted -- and the deficit would have been even larger.\n\nIndeed, even if the federal estate tax return was removed from the state\u2019s 2011-\u201913 budget, there still would be a surplus, just a smaller one. Seidel noted this herself.\n\nSo where does this leave us?\n\nAs the GOP touts passage of a budget that doesn\u2019t include a structural deficit, Seidel claims the number is bogus because it is puffed up by $219 million -- based on current law that calls for the estate tax to go back into effect in 2010.\n\nBut the Legislative Fiscal Bureau calculated the budget the way it always has. They even footnoted the issue for clarity. The bureau\u2019s calculations are a picture in time -- where the budget stands today.

{"label": "true", "claim": "Glenn Beck \"The federal government is now on track\" for the second-largest budget deficit \"in 65 years.\"", "evidence": "Vice President Joe Biden talks a lot about the success of the government's economic policies, but not everybody is persuaded. Reacting to Biden's Aug. 24, 2010, statement that \"we are turning this great ship of state around,\" TV host Glenn Beck pointed to the country's dire fiscal situation.\n\n\"Remember, Joe Biden says no doubt we're headed in the right direction on the economy. Well, we're just getting started with the news of the day. How about this one? Unemployment 9.6 percent. The real unemployment number is 16.5 for July. The federal government is now on track for the second-largest budget shortfall in 65 years, 9.1 of GDP. And in 31 months, Congress has added $4.4 trillion to the 10-year spending baseline. Who's going to lend us more money?\" Beck said on his Aug. 25, 2010, show.\n\nIn this item, we'll focus on the claim that the federal government \"is now on track for the second-largest budget shortfall in 65 years.\"\n\nWe turned to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the official scorekeeper for Congress. Its most recent estimates, published in August 2010, indicate that in 2010, the federal deficit will exceed $1.3 trillion. As a percentage of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product -- the value of the goods and services that the economy produces -- that's 9.1 percent, as Beck said. How does that compare with previous years? We checked data going back to 1930 from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), a government agency that helps prepare the president's annual budget. Only in 2009 and in the war years 1942, 1943, 1944 and 1945 was the deficit-to-GDP ratio higher than 9.1 percent, according to the OMB. But going back 65 years only takes you to 1946, so that would put 2010 on track to be the second-highest, according to CBO's figures.\n\nThe CBO and the OMB have slightly different projections for the 2010 deficit, with the CBO's being the more recent. The discrepancy arises from differences in the agencies' projections of future economic conditions and the impact of legislation enacted after the OMB completed its estimates. OMB projected in July that the 2010 deficit will be 10.6 percent of GDP. That would make it the biggest in 65 years -- not the second biggest. But looking back 65 years and using the CBO's estimate, as Beck did, the deficit was higher as a percentage of GDP only in 2009, when it stood at 9.9 percent.\n\nWe thought it would be valuable to explore the reasons behind the current deficit as well as the projected deficits over the next decade. We spoke to a number of economists and found that they offer different explanations.\n\nBrian Riedl, a budget analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told us via e-mail that the main drivers of today's deficit are the ongoing economic downturn, which has reduced government revenues, and the policies that the government has enacted in response to the crisis. \"Recession automatically reduces revenues and increases unemployment and antipoverty spending, even if Congress does nothing. At the same time, we have enacted $1 trillion in stimulus spending, plus TARP, Fannie/Freddie bailouts, and large discretionary spending hikes. So enacted policies are certainly a contributor,\" Riedl wrote.\n\nThe CBO provided a similar explanation. \"This year\u2019s deficit is attributable in large part to a combination of weak revenues and elevated spending associated with the economic downturn and the policies implemented in response to it.\"\n\nSpeaking about future projections, Riedl wrote that future deficits are likely to remain well over a trillion due to \"runaway government spending.\"\n\nKathy Ruffing, a senior policy analyst at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, emphasized that even before President Barack Obama took office, the CBO had already projected that the 2009 deficit would exceed $1 trillion. The 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan accounted for over $500 billion of that, she wrote on June 28, 2010. Riedl, however, disagrees. \"Both recent and future budget deficits have been blamed largely on the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, and to a lesser extent on the war on terrorism, but the data contradict these myths. In reality, spending is almost exclusively the problem,\" he wrote in a June 2010 report.\n\nFinally, Chris Dreibelbis, the outreach and public liaison for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan Washington, D.C., think tank, pointed to the recession and the policy responses to it as the \"main culprits\" in the current deficit. \"Going forward, the structural problems that were there before the recession will combine with the growth in spending from an aging population and health care costs, to cause large and ongoing deficits even once the economy recovers,\" he wrote us in an e-mail.\n\nSo let's review. Beck said that we're on track to have the second-biggest budget deficit in 65 years. According to the Congressional Budget Office, he's right. Going by the administration's own estimate, the situation is even more dire"}

But the measure didn't make it through the Senate, where proponents fell five votes short of the 60 needed to cut off debate and usher the legislation to the floor.\n\nWe're not getting into whether providing a path for undocumented minors to become citizens is the same thing as amnesty. Yet we waded into the family issue earlier this month when we rated Barely True a statement by Smith's Texas colleague, Rep. Ted-Poe, R-Humble, who said that \"after you complete two years of post high school education or two years of military service you are eligible for citizenship. Once a citizen, this paves the way to bring the rest of their extended family to the United States.\"\n\nPoe skipped several stipulations that an undocumented citizen must satisfy before becoming a citizen, and he went too far when he said undocumented-residents-turned-citizens can sponsor their extended family to come here. According to the U.S. State Department, citizens cannot sponsor grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins or in-laws to come legally to the United States.\n\nSmith's statement reflects accurately on provisions in federal law permitting a citizen to sponsor immediate family members \u2014 a spouse, unmarried children or adopted children under 21 \u2014 to enter the country with an \"immediate relative immigrant visa.\" Citizens 21 and older can sponsor their parents for legal permanent residence as well, according to the State Department.\n\n"}
{"label": "pants-fire", "claim": "Mitt Romney The U.S. military is at risk of losing its \"military superiority\" because \"our Navy is smaller than it's been since 1917. Our Air Force is smaller and older than any time since 1947.\"", "evidence": "During the Jan. 16, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C., former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney took aim at President Barack Obama\u2019s support for the U.S. military.\n\"The most extraordinary thing that's happened with this military authorization is the president is planning on cutting $1 trillion out of military spending,\" Romney said. \"Our Navy is smaller than it's been since 1917. Our Air Force is smaller and older than any time since 1947. We are cutting our number of troops. We are not giving the veterans the care they deserve. We simply cannot continue to cut our Department of Defense budget if we are going to remain the hope of the Earth. And I will fight to make sure America retains military superiority.\"\nThis comment includes a lot of separate claims, but after a number of readers contacted us, we decided to focus on two of them: \"Our Navy is smaller than it's been since 1917,\" and, \"Our Air Force is smaller and older than any time since 1947.\"\nHis underlying point: The U.S. military has been seriously weakened compared to what it was 50 and 100 years ago.\nWe\u2019ll look at both the numbers as well as the larger context. But as you'll see below, using the number of military ships and airplanes is an outdated practice that one expert says \"doesn't pass 'the giggle test.' \"\nThe Navy numbers\nThe Romney campaign didn\u2019t get back to us, but we found their likely sourcing when we contacted the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.\nIn January 2010, Heritage published a report titled, \"The State of the U.S. Military.\" Citing data from the Naval History and Heritage Command, a part of the Defense Department, the report said that \"the U.S. Navy\u2019s fleet today contains the smallest number of ships since 1916. The total number of active ships in the Navy declined from 592 to 283 between 1989 and 2009.\"\nWe looked up the original data, and the Heritage report does reflect the trend line correctly (though Romney said 1917 rather than 1916, something we won\u2019t quibble with). In 1916, the U.S. Navy had 245 active ships, a number that eventually peaked during World War II, then fell, then peaked again more modestly during the Korean War, followed by a slow, consistent decline over the next five decades.\nIn recent years, the number of active ships has fallen low enough to approach its 1916 level. In both 2009 (the most recent year of the Heritage report) and 2011, the number was 285.\nSo Romney has a point. However, even using this metric -- which, as we\u2019ll argue later, is an imperfect one for measuring military strength -- this is not the lowest level since 1916.\nThe same data set shows that during the years 2005 to 2008, the number of active ships was 282, 281, 278 and 282, respectively -- each of which were below the levels of 2009, 2010 and 2011. In other words, each of the final four years under George W. Bush saw lower levels of active ships than any of the three years under Obama. The number of surface warships also bottomed out in 2005 under Bush, later rising by about 10 percent under Obama.\nSuch figures undercut Romney\u2019s use of the statistic as a weapon against Obama.\nThe Air Force numbers\nHow about the Air Force? First, let\u2019s look at the total number of aircraft.\nWe found extensive data in a report titled, \"Arsenal of Airpower: USAF Aircraft Inventory, 1950-2009,\" authored by retired Air Force Col. James C. Ruehrmund Jr. and Christopher J. Bowie and published in November 2010 by the Mitchell Institute, a research and analysis organization founded by the Air Force Association.\nThe figures for 2009 show 5,988 total aircraft (4,460 active, 375 reserve and 1,153 in the Air National Guard). That\u2019s a lower number than any year going back at least to 1950, the earliest year tallied in the report. So while we don\u2019t have data going back to 1947, the specific year Romney cited, his claim about the size of the Air Force seems credible. (Figure 2 on page 5 of the Mitchell Institute report provides a good graphical representation of the numerical patterns over time.)\nNow, let\u2019s look at the age of the Air Force\u2019s assets.\nThe Heritage report includes a chart titled, \"The Oldest Air Force in U.S. History,\" referencing an October 2005 Government Accountability Office report, \"DOD Needs to Identify and Address Gaps and Potential Risks in Program Strategies and Funding Priorities for Selected Equipment.\" We couldn\u2019t find specific support in the GAO report for the claim that the Air Force of today (or, to be precise, the Air Force of 2005 when Bush was president) was the oldest since 1947. However, the report, combined with the analysis of experts we asked, suggest that it\u2019s a fair conclusion.\nThe GAO looked at 30 pieces of equipment from various branches (not just the Air Force) and found that \"reported readiness rates declined between fiscal years 1999 and 2004 for most of these items. The decline in readiness, which occurred more markedly in fiscal years 2003 and 2004, generally resulted from (1) the continued high use of equipment to support current operations and (2) maintenance issues caused by the advancing ages and complexity of the systems.\"\nCharles Morrison, a researcher at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the U.S. \"bought more aircraft in the early 1950s than in all the years combined from 1956 to 2011, clearly at the cost of an older fleet.\"\n\n"}

Bush and Mitt Romney, said during an Aug. 20, 2017, discussion on the show that Trump\u2019s backers have stuck with him through controversies because they didn\u2019t see an alternative option. Democrats attacking Trump\u2019s response to violence in Charlottesville, Va., just fed into growing bitterness among his base over their dire socioeconomic situation, he said.\n\"What I think a lot of Trump supporters heard this week was, the Democrats are just painting us, Trump supporters, with a Nazi brush. We're all white supremacists. That's their excuse for why they lost the election,\" Castellanos said. \"No. White working-class America, death rates among white men are up 20 percent. They're unemployed. Gwen Ifill said, \u2018no wonder they're resentful.\u2019\"\nWe wondered about his statistic that working-class white men are dying at a higher rate than before. It turns out that researchers have identified increasing mortality among the white working class, but it\u2019s not as high for men as the 20 percent number Castellanos cited.\nIncreased mortality rates\nIn response to our questions, Castellanos sent us two articles from the New York Times and the Guardian about a 2015 paper by husband-and-wife Princeton economists Angus Deaton and Anne Case. Their research showed that death rates for middle-aged, white Americans had been going up, while they had been going down for every other age, race and ethnic group. Those rates also had been falling in other countries.\nThis was a reversal of a years-long trend in which mortality rates had been steadily decreasing, meaning that Americans across many groups were living longer. From 1978 to 1998, white Americans were seeing mortality rates fall about 2 percent each year. So the fact that Case and Deaton found an increase was considered significant.\nBut Deaton told us the 20 percent number Castellanos cited for men was too high. (That\u2019s a number the Guardian reported, but it cites the increase as being for \"the death rate for white Americans aged 45 to 54.\")\n\"In our 2015 PNAS paper, we say that for all white non-Hispanics (men and women together), mortality rates for those aged 45 to 54 rose at half of one percent per year, which from 1998 to 2013 is 7.8 percent, not 20 percent, and certainly not 20 percent for men only,\" Deaton wrote via email. Case added that that was for all levels of education, not just people who didn\u2019t have a college degree.\nDeaton and Case\u2019s study showed that mortality rates were climbing for white, non-Hispanic Americans aged 45 to 54 with a high school education or less. The research further showed that deaths were up from drug and alcohol poisonings, suicides, chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis. Mortality rates rose for all education groups, but \"those with less education saw the most marked increases,\" the paper read.\nIt\u2019s important to note that overall mortality rates for African-Americans were still higher than whites. But African-Americans still recorded an overall drop in the same time period, not an increase.\nResearchers were surprised by the Case and Deaton study in 2015. Dartmouth economists Ellen Meara and Jonathan Skinner said in an analysis that while most Americans\u2019 life expectancies had gone up in the face of the Great Recession and rising income inequality, the study\u2019s findings \"dashed even this cautiously optimistic view of the past several decades.\"\n\n"}

For instance, the state misdemeanor of possession of marijuana is a felony for immigration purposes, but trespassing is not, the DA\u2019s office said.\nAs a result, attorneys may consider \"reasonable modifications\" in sentence recommendations and alternative offenses that a defendant can plead to in order to reach an \"immigration-neutral disposition,\" the policy said.\nIn certain cases, a non-U.S. citizen if appropriate may be offered a plea for a lesser offense \"in light of the disproportionate immigration consequences a higher level offense may result in,\" the office said in its release.\n\"When possible, the alternative should be similar in level of offense and length of sentence to that offered to a citizen defendant, while the charge may be different,\" the Brooklyn DA said.\nSessions said DAs advertise \"that they will charge a criminal alien with a lesser offense,\" but a spokesperson for the Brooklyn DA said their policy \"does not pertain to charging decisions.\" But rather to the sentencing recommendations and offenses to which defendants can plead, which happens after charges are made.\n\"The charges decision is completely neutral. The charges happen before there\u2019s even thought about immigration status,\" Oren Yaniv, spokesperson for the Brooklyn DA\u2019s Office told PolitiFact.\nIt\u2019s toward the end of the case when the office takes into consideration their policy, he said.\nThe American Bar Association describes the plea bargaining process as involving \"the defendant's pleading guilty to a lesser charge, or to only one of several charges.

The former Massachusetts governor, who owns a home on New Hampshire\u2019s Lake Winnipesaukee, likes to think of himself as one of the Granite State\u2019s own. But state Democratic leaders were quick to point out last week that state voters haven\u2019t always returned Romney\u2019s affection.\n\nSpeaking with reporters on a June 27, 2011, conference call, Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley said Romney, who placed second in the 2008 primary, was the first Bay State politician in decades who failed to win the New Hampshire primary.\n\n\"It's important to note that Mitt Romney is the first Massachusetts politician to run for president and not win the New Hampshire primary in a generation,\" Buckley said. \"The people of New Hampshire know him very well.\"\n\nPolitiFact decided to check the record books.\n\nPrior to Romney\u2019s last run in 2008, the last three Massachusetts politicians to run for the Oval Office all got off to good starts by winning the New Hampshire primary, according to state voting records.\n\nIn 2004, John Kerry, the U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, won the Democratic primary, defeating former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, among other candidates. Twelve years earlier, in 1992, U.S. Sen. Paul Tsongas defeated Bill Clinton to win the primary; and four years prior to that, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis won the primary on his way to the 1988 Democratic nomination.\n\nPolitical analysts say all three Massachusetts residents took advantage of the physical -- and philosophical -- proximity of the two states.\n\nVoters from both states tend to hold common cultural values, political attitudes and histories, according to Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. And, because much of southern New Hampshire, the state\u2019s most populous area, falls within the Boston media market, Granite State voters are often familiar with Massachusetts candidates even before election season begins, added David King, a lecturer at Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government.\n\nBut the home court advantage doesn\u2019t help all Massachusetts candidates.

Democratic State Rep. Stacey Evans favors expanding Medicaid, but said the state could take other action as well.\n\"There are thousands of Georgia workers that are misclassified as independent contractors, so that their employers can wrongfully deny them the benefits that they deserve, including health care,\" Evans said Aug. 5. \"By expanding Medicaid and classifying workers appropriately, insurance will be available to hundreds of thousands more Georgians.\"\nWe decided to check Evans\u2019 number of misclassified workers, and found she\u2019s on safe ground.\nDefining misclassification\nSome businesses avoid treating workers as employees by calling them an independent contractor. The person might work only for that one business, use equipment the business provides and do exactly what the business tells him or her to do, and yet be labeled as if the person was in business for themselves.\nThe advantage for companies is they avoid paying a number of employment taxes, including Medicare, Social Security and unemployment insurance. If they offer health insurance, they would sidestep that too.\nAs Georgia\u2019s Department of Labor put it, \"independent contractors are not independent just because that is what their employer calls them, because that is what they call themselves, or because they sign an \u2018independent contractor agreement.\u2019 Independent contractor status depends on the underlying nature of the work relationship.\"\nIn a recent case, a state administrative judge ruled that a man who drove for a Georgia limousine service was actually an employee and not an independent contractor, as the company (and the state Department of Labor) claimed. The company had required the man to set up his own limited liability corporation, but the ruling said that made no difference.\nThe driver used a company car, and he was \"given direction as to where to drive, when to drive, how to drive, how often to drive, and the rates to charge customers.\"\nThe judge called this an \"extreme\" case of misclassification.\nThe number in Georgia\nEvans\u2019 campaign spokesman Seth Clark said she relied on a 2015 Georgia Senate study.\nThat report said an accurate estimate was difficult to make because the state had never done a complete study, as other states have done.

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Scott Walker The state is able to sharply curtail contract bargaining rights for state employee unions.", "evidence": "There\u2019s little doubt about where Gov. Scott Walker is coming from when it comes to public employees and the size of state government.\n\nWith a hole of about $3 billion in the state budget, Walker aims to wring as many concessions as possible from state workers. In a Jan. 3, 2011 New York Times article, Walker called public employees \"haves\" and taxpayers \"have-nots.\" And he has vowed to restore balance for \u00a0taxpayers.\n\nIn December 2010, even before he took office, the door opened wider for Walker when the Democratic-controlled Legislature could not muster enough votes to approve contracts for 39,000 state workers negotiated by outgoing Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat.\n\nThose contracts, which cover 2009-2011, and future deals are now in the hands of Walker, a Republican, and the GOP-controlled Legislature.\n\nIn early December, at a Milwaukee Press Club luncheon, Walker indicated that when he took office he would take a broad view of his authority.\n\nWalker said he was open to considering \"anything from the decertify all the way through modifications of the current laws in place.\"\n\nHe added: \"The bottom line is that we are going to look at every legal means we have to try to put that balance more on the side of taxpayers and the people who care about services.\"\n\nIf anything, now that Walker\u2019s in office, the question of what authority he and like-minded lawmakers have to change bargaining rules is more important.\n\nCould Walker, as he claimed, take action to sharply curtail the bargaining rights of state employee unions?\n\nLet\u2019s start with the question of \"decertifying\" unions.\n\nThat phrase refers to a decision by union members to disband. Government cannot decertify a union; only the members can. Walker clearly incorrectly used that term -- he repeated it after it was included in a question by a reporter at the Press Club event. \u00a0\n\nIn the wake of Walker\u2019s comment, some critics seized on that word to declare Walker was flat-out wrong about what he could do as governor. However, focusing on the word \"decertify\" ignores the entirety of the full statement, which is what we are evaluating in this item.\n\n\"He can\u2019t decertify a union per se,\" labor historian Ken Germanson said in a radio interview with WUWM.\n\nBut Germanson and other labor experts agree that Walker and the Legislature have control over bargaining parameters because it is the state that sets the rules for the areas subject to negotiations. That is, Walker can change the rules if the Legislature goes along.\n\nAnd with Republicans holding both chambers, he may have support on those fronts.\n\nWhat would Walker have to do?\n\nIt\u2019s as simple -- and complicated -- as amending the state Employee Relations Act, said Peter Davis, general counsel at the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission.\n\nWhile federal labor law covers unions at private employers; state employees are covered by that piece of state law. Though it has not changed much over the years, it could be changed.\n\n\"The rights established by the State Employment Labor Relations Act have not been amended in any significant way for at least the last 30 years -- aside from expanding/adding the types/numbers of employees who have (the) rights,\" Davis said.\n\nDavis and other experts say Walker and the Legislature probably could not do away with labor unions entirely, but they could modify what\u2019s subject to negotiations.\n\nFor instance, they could eliminate subjects like health insurance and pensions from collective bargaining. That would allow the administration to impose changes in those areas. Walker has said requiring employees to pay 5 percent of wages toward their pensions and 12 percent of their health care costs could save the state $150 million between January and June.\n\nOther permitted topics for bargaining include wages, vacation time and work conditions.\n\nState employee unions do not have a right to binding arbitration to settle impasses. And the labor act forbids strikes -- something the state likely would not want to give up.\n\nWithout arbitration or a credible strike threat, Davis said, when compared to other public employee unions \"state employee unions have always had less power at the bargaining table.\"\n\nMarty Beil, executive director of the Wisconsin State Employees Union, told the Journal Sentinel that the state law \"assures the uninterrupted delivery of high-quality public services and has kept labor peace for more than three decades.\"\n\nWalker spokesman Cullen Werwie said the governor would not include a rewrite of the state law as part of the emergency special session of the Legislature called to deal with the economy and jobs.\n\nHe said there are a number of options available, including immediately beginning talks with state employee unions.\n\n\"There are two parties in contract negotiations, the state and the unions,\" Werwie said. \"My guess is that union leadership will stay the same, the state negotiator will change (under Walker), which I would argue is a 50 percent change in participants. That 50 percent change will provide the incoming administration with greater latitude in contract talks.\"\n\nAll that remains to be seen. Where does that leave us right now?\n\nIn his response to a question, Walker misused the phrase \"decertify\" -- he can\u2019t make state employees unions vanish. But labor experts agree with the central part of Walker\u2019s statement -- the Legislature could rewrite the laws governing what issues are subject to negotiation, which could tilt the bargaining table in the administration\u2019s favor"}

However, we did wonder whether Wasserman Schultz was correct about past changes -- specifically, whether South Florida has \"had nine inches of sea-level rise since the 1920s.\"\n\nFirst, some background on sea-level rises. \"Sea level\" refers to the height of the ocean\u2019s surface as measured either by a mechanical tide gauge (a method used since the 19th century) or, since the late 1990s, by satellite measurements. The kind of changes Wasserman Schultz mentioned are not short-term changes such as high tide and low tide, but rather average sea-level measurements taken over the course of many years.\n\nWe located sea level data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for a variety of locations, including Miami Beach, Fla. Using tide gauge data from 1931 to 1981, NOAA found a change equivalent to 0.78 feet in 100 years. That's roughly nine inches since the 1920s.\n\nWe checked with two scientists who specialize in sea-level measurements -- Gary B Griggs, director of the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of California-Santa Cruz, and Gary Mitchum, a physical oceanographer at the University of South Florida -- and both agreed that the NOAA data was an appropriate source for Wasserman Schultz to rely on. Both scientists considered her claim to be accurate.\n\nWe will, however, offer two notes of caution when thinking about sea-level rise.\n\n"}

So, by that measure, is the average public school teacher in Wisconsin \"making $89,000 a year\"?\n\nThe latest figures available are for 2009-2010, according to a state Department of Public Instruction spokesman. Public school teachers in Wisconsin earned an average of $49,816 in salary plus $25,325 in benefits for a total of $75,141.\n\nThat\u2019s about 16 percent less than the $89,000 claimed by Paul.\n\nThe $75,141 total compensation figure, of course, is a statewide average.\n\nThe figures vary across districts, according to tallies from the Department of Public Instruction.

Jeb Bush, former Republican governor of Florida and potential 2016 presidential candidate, has a partial solution -- promote immigration.\n\nBush, speaking at the Faith and Freedom Coalition Conference in Washington, made a pitch for immigration reform, saying America needs more new workers to help pay for retirees -- \"to rebuild the demographic pyramid\" as he put it.\n\n\"Immigrants are more fertile,\" Bush said. \"And they love families and they have more intact families, and they bring a younger population. Immigrants create an engine of economic prosperity.\"\n\nBush\u2019s reference to the fertility of immigrants stirred up an immediate flurry of activity on Twitter and the comment sections of news websites. Some said his words were callous, some said he was simply speaking the truth.\n\nWe decided to take an evidence-based look into the fertility of immigrants. The key here is understanding the meaning of the word \"fertile.\" Fertility can mean the ability to have children, but it can also refer to the birth rate of a population. In context, Bush's comments clearly referred to the second definition. We contacted Bush\u2019s office; his spokesperson, Jaryn Emhoff, told us Bush was referring to birth rate.\n\nOn that front, there is no debate about the numbers. The Pew Research Center reported in 2012 that the birth rate among foreign-born women was nearly 50 percent higher than for U.S.-born women -- 87.8 births per 1,000 women compared with 58.9 births per 1,000 women of prime child bearing age (15-44).\n\nA major reason why immigrant birth rates are higher has to do with the age of new arrivals; as a group, they skew young, which means more of them are likely to be ready to start families. If you looked at a group of foreign-born women and the same number of U.S.-born women, all between 15 and 44 years old, you would find more women closer to 20 years old among the immigrants.\n\nHowever, the Pew report noted an important trend. While birth rates for all women dropped between 2007 and 2010, it fell much faster among immigrant women. It declined by 14 percent compared with 6 percent for women born in America.\n\nAnalysts differ on what is driving this change, and the debate has some bearing on Bush\u2019s main interest in promoting immigration. The Pew researchers believe the data shows that these women are simply not having children. An alternative explanation is that there are fewer young immigrant women.\n\nEmilio Parrado, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania, leans towards that one. Parrado \u00a0said that the data tell him that the real reason for the drop in the immigrant birth rate is the recession. With fewer jobs in America, fewer people had the incentive to come.\n\n"}

Early in the month, a Wall Street Journal contributor took the federal government to task for \"distorting\" the numbers on food insecurity. At the end of September, the New York Post carried an op-ed with the headline, Feeding America: \u2018Public service'\u00a0lies.\nFeeding America is a large nonprofit that raises money and secures food donations on behalf of food banks nationwide. The Post op-ed written by William Benson Huber zeroed in on the organization\u2019s message in its public service announcements. Huber opened his op-ed with a quote from a radio ad, \"People say I\u2019m a pretty good kid. Why, in a country as rich as America, should I have to go to bed hungry?\"\nThe ads, writes Huber, \"inform us of a horror we\u2019d otherwise think impossible: America has so failed its children that 17 million \u2014 one in five \u2014 don\u2019t have enough to eat. Except that, enjoyable as all this self-loathing might seem, it\u2019s simply a fairy tale.\"\nHuber, who is a marketing consultant and not a full-time Post employee,\u00a0then challenged Feeding America\u2019s \"nonsensical claim that one in five kids is fighting starvation daily.\"\n\"The only basis for Feeding America\u2019s claim comes from U.S. Department of Agriculture surveys in which heads of households were asked if at any time during a calendar year their children were a) unable to eat what they wanted; b) unable to eat in whatever quantity they wanted; c) forced to eat cheaper brands, or d) afraid their food supply might run out on any single day.\"\nIn this fact-check, we focus on Huber\u2019s statement that Feeding America misled the public when it\u00a0said that \"one in five kids is fighting starvation daily.\"\nAs it turns out, we can find no evidence that Feeding America ever made that claim. We asked Huber, and he backed away from it.\n\"The words they use about going to bed hungry seems to me to be starving,\" Huber said. \"I applied that word to their language.\"\nFeeding America spokesman Ross Fraser told PunditFact that his organization is very careful with its language, and it never speaks of kids starving.\n\"We say \u2018facing hunger,\u2019 or \u2018at risk of hunger,\u2019 or \u2018on the precipice of hunger,\u2019 \" Fraser\u00a0said. \"Because the federal government\u2019s data is not about hunger. It\u2019s about food insecurity.\"\nWe\u2019ll get into the federal data in just a bit, but beyond denying that Feeding America speaks of starvation, Fraser also denied that his group ever used the line about kids going to bed hungry.\n\"We don\u2019t have any public service announcements that use that,\" Fraser\u00a0said.\nEllyn Fisher, a spokeswoman for the Ad Council, the corporate-backed nonprofit that distributes the announcements, was equally emphatic.\n\"I have confirmed that we have never used the line you are referring to in a PSA,\" Fisher said.\nThe radio and video segments we found on the Ad Council website did not contain the language Huber cited. Huber said he wrote it down but he was not able to provide any further proof. Our search of the Internet Archive, a massive compendium of audio, video and text posted on the Internet, also came up empty.\nHuber also named two celebrity spokeswomen for Feeding America, Paula Deen and Beyonce, that the organization said had not been part of its public service\u00a0efforts. Huber later told us that Deen had done some work for New York food banks, but that, \"strictly speaking I\u00a0don't know if she had an audio PSA.\"\nFurther, Huber acknowledged that in order to shorten the piece,\u00a0he paraphrased the questions he drew from the Agriculture Department\u2019s survey. Here are the actual statements and questions put to families:\n1. \"We relied on only a few kinds of low-cost food to feed our children because we were running out of money to buy food.\" Was that often, sometimes, or never true for you in the last 12 months?\n\n"}
{"label": "pants-fire", "claim": "Rick Scott A Scott Rothstein victim says that he was \"swindled\" by Charlie Crist.", "evidence": "A TV ad released by the Republican Party of Florida has created major buzz in Florida\u2019s political world.\nThe ad featured an unidentified man who said he was swindled by Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein -- and, by extension, by former Gov. Charlie Crist, who is now a Democrat and seeking to unseat Florida Gov. Rick Scott.\n\"Scott Rothstein swindled a lot of people, me included,\" the unidentified narrator said. \"He bankrupted many families. Nobody was closer to Rothstein than Charlie Crist. Rothstein was always around Charlie, throwing parties and giving Charlie money. Rothstein bragged that he gave Charlie Crist money so he could pick judges. Of course Charlie took the money. I got swindled by both Rothstein and Charlie. If Charlie Crist will sell judgeships, everything is for sale.\"\nThe ad -- which has run at least 4,000 times at a cost of about $2 million -- includes photos of Rothstein and Crist embracing each other and blowing out the candles on Crist\u2019s 52nd birthday cake. (Technical note: The ad was released by the state Republican Party, but it is on Scott\u2019s behalf. Scott\u2019s campaign has been defending it and he initially referred questions about the ad to his campaign. So that's why we're putting Scott on the Truth-O-Meter.)\nPolitiFact Florida has previously fact-checked two claims related to Rothstein, who began a 50-year prison sentence in 2010 for convictions related to a $1.4 billion Ponzi scheme that involved the sale of fabricated legal settlements.\nBut Scott\u2019s charge that Crist \"swindled\" an investor is new -- and represents a serious charge. Crist unveiled his own counter-attack that calls the ad a lie and recounts Scott\u2019s $1.7 billion Medicare fraud related to his days as CEO of a health care company.\nWe decided to put it to the Truth-O-Meter.\nWe\u2019ve relied heavily on the work of Miami Herald political writer Marc Caputo and federal courts reporter Jay Weaver. On Sept. 16, Caputo and Weaver broke the story that the investor was Dean Kretschmar of Fort Lauderdale.\nThe investor\u2019s lawsuit didn\u2019t mention Crist\nKretschmar was part of an investor group known as Razorback that invested with Rothstein. On or around June 2009, Kretschmar invested $8 million, according to the lawsuit Kretschmar and other investors filed in November 2009.\nThe lawsuit named several defendants, including Rothstein and TD Bank, the banker for Rothstein\u2019s law firm. Crist\u2019s name isn\u2019t mentioned in the lawsuit.\nThe group sought $190 million and settled for $170 million with TD Bank, the Herald reported. The newspaper reported that Kretschmar recouped most of his investment.\nUnmentioned in the ad is that Kretschmar\u2019s lawyer is William R. Scherer, a Scott donor.\nEarlier this year, Scott\u2019s office hired Scherer\u2019s law firm to sue Digital Domain, a digital effects company that had animated the scenes in Titanic and the Transformers movies. Under Crist, the company received $20 million from the state but in 2012 shut down its Florida operation and declared bankruptcy without creating the hundreds of jobs it had promised the state.\n(Scherer told the Herald the point of the ad was that Crist took Rothstein\u2019s money \u2014 about $81,000 for Crist\u2019s unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign in 2010 \u2014 at the same time that Kretschmar was being ripped off.

Those losses, along with other tax write-offs and maneuvers \u2014 such as a $72.9 million tax refund that\u2019s being scrutinized by the Internal Revenue Service and a congressional tax committee \u2014 have enabled the president to avoid paying much in federal income taxes while sustaining his lavish lifestyle.\nIn a Sept. 27 briefing at the White House, Trump dismissed the report. The next morning, one of his media defenders suggested that the report is much ado about nothing.\n\"I had an accountant look at it last night,\" radio host Hugh Hewitt said on his show. \"It's what any wealthy person's tax history is, if you can believe it \u2014 which is good years and bad years, years of immense taxes and years of almost no taxes at all because you carry over losses.\"\nHow does Trump\u2019s tax history compare with other wealthy people? We asked eight tax experts if the low tax bills and aggressive tax avoidance documented by the Times are typical of the rich.\nWithout access to the tax returns for Trump and others, they said, it\u2019s hard to draw comparisons. Everyone pays taxes according to their own unique circumstances, and wealthy people can use a variety of legal maneuvers to reduce their tax bills.\nBut the experts generally agreed that at least two aspects of Trump\u2019s tax history as described in the Times report stand out compared with other wealthy people who may also try to legally reduce their tax bills: the severity of his losses and the extent of his tax avoidance.\n\"The Trump tax returns appear highly unusual compared to typical wealthy taxpayers,\" said Kimberly Clausing, a professor of economics at Reed College. \"His losses are more persistent, his tax avoidance is more aggressive, and there are signs of tax evasion. The audit itself is a big red flag, and many of the described deductions sound borderline at best.\"\n\"I can't think of anyone who was as aggressive as Trump over such a sustained period,\" added Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. He called Hewitt\u2019s claim \"ridiculous.\"\u00a0\nHewitt did not respond to a request for comment.\nTrump has avoided taxes and overseen major business losses\nTrump has filed the annual financial disclosure forms required of executive branch employees, listing his income sources and assets.

The lawyer said Trump had paid millions of dollars in federal taxes, but didn\u2019t provide details or documentation.\nThe Times reported that Trump paid little to no federal income taxes in many years, largely because his businesses \u2014 including major properties like his Doral, Fla., resort \u2014 have often reported losses that he has used to wipe out income tax liabilities for his earnings from \"The Apprentice\" TV show, branding deals and investments.\n\"Trump is using large tax losses from some businesses to offset his active income from wages or other businesses,\" said Edward McCaffery, a professor of law, economics and political science at the University of Southern California.\nThe Times reported that the nearly $1 billion in losses Trump experienced in the early 1990s generated tax deductions he was able to use through 2005. After new income from \"The Apprentice\" brought his tax bills back into the millions, he went on a buying spree, purchasing new golf courses and other properties that have since incurred similar losses.\nWealthy businesspeople do at times experience volatility with their incomes, or bad years followed by good ones, experts said.

{"label": "false", "claim": "Jeff Atwater Loranne \"Ausley's a financial train wreck for taxpayers -- pushing gas taxes, property taxes, taxes on seniors.\"", "evidence": "In her TV ad, Democratic chief financial officer candidate Loranne Ausley threw a series of three claims against her Republican opponent Jeff Atwater. We said False.\n\nNow Atwater is firing back with a trio of claims against Ausley in an ad of his own.\n\nThe ad is called \"Two Liberals,\" and liberally tries to tie Ausley to U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Yes, they are both Democrats and women.\n\n\"This Washington liberal is raising taxes and wrecking our economy. Now, Pelosi has Loranne Ausley, the Tallahassee politician who wants total control ... of our money,\" a narrator says. \"Watch out, because Ausley's a financial train wreck for taxpayers -- pushing gas taxes, property taxes, taxes on seniors.\n\n\"Pelosi and Ausley -- too liberal too costly.\"\n\nLike Ausley's ad attacking Atwater, we're fact-checking the whole of the three specific claims -- that Ausley, a former member of the Florida House, pushed gas taxes, property taxes and taxes as seniors.\n\nOur analysis reveals a political art -- clever wording.\n\nGas taxes\n\nAusley didn't push for increased gas taxes as a member of the state House. Instead, she voted against a one-month, eight-cent reduction of the gas tax back in 2004.\n\nHere are the details. The bill, HB 237, reduced the state gas tax from 14.3 cents to 6.3 cents in August 2004, and also created a back-to-school sales tax holiday for school items $50 or less. The proposal passed with broad bipartisan support: 107-8 in the House and 34-4 in the Senate. Ausley was one of the eight no votes in the House. Atwater, a member of the state Senate, voted yes.\n\nBut that didn't mean the measure was completely popular. Newspaper editorials argued the loss in state revenue for temporarily lowering the gas tax -- about $60 million -- wasn't worth the small savings to drivers. The Sarasota Herald-Tribune editorial board calculated that the average driver would save a \"whopping\" $3.67. \"Don't spend it all in one place,\" they wrote.\n\n\"Loranne voted to keep the existing tax structure in place, as well as against the entire budget that year because of the lack of funding for important issues like boosting teacher salaries and the critical funding of Florida KidCare,\" Ausley spokesman Kevin Cate said.\n\nIt's worth noting that the idea of a gas tax holiday resurfaced in 2008 and was being pushed by Gov. Charlie Crist. Crist asked state Sen. Mike Fasano, R-New Port Richey, to file an amendment to a revenue bill (SB 1838) that would suspend 10 cents of the state's gas tax for a two-week period from July 1-14. But the amendment was never heard in the GOP-controlled Senate and Atwater, as a senator, didn't have to take a vote on the measure. Neither did Ausley, who was in the House.\n\nProperty taxes\n\nAusley didn't push for increased property taxes as a member of the state House. Instead, she voted against Republican proposals to cut property taxes.\n\nHere are the details. During a special session in June 2007, Ausley voted against sending a proposed constitutional amendment to the ballot asking voters to replace Save Our Homes assessment caps with bigger homestead exemptions. Under the proposal, which passed without a Democratic vote, the first $200,000 of value would get a 75 percent exemption, then property values between $300,000 and $500,000 would get an additional 15 percent exemption. Homes valued at $500,000 and up would get a maximum exemption of $195,000.\n\nDemocrats argued that the tax cuts could harm funding for education and for police and fire protection. Ausley did vote to schedule the special election for the proposal on Jan. 29, 2008. She also voted for a proposal to roll back the tax bases for cities, counties and special taxing districts.\n\nUltimately, the Republican-led constitutional proposal was tossed off the ballot by a judge who ruled the amendment was confusing.\n\nSo legislators returned to deal with the constitutional proposal that October. Ausley was just one of two House members to vote against a House plan to raise the homestead exemption, create a cap on assessment increases for non-homesteaded property, provide additional exemptions for low-income seniors, and allow people to move and keep some of their homestead tax cap. According to the Tallahassee Democrat, Ausley complained that the \"cuts would devastate poor and rural counties.\"\n\nThat proposal never became law or was put to voters either. Instead, the final tax reform product in 2007 -- what became known as Amendment 1 on January 2008 ballots -- passed the House 97-18 and the Senate 35-4. Ausley again voted against the measure.\n\nAmendment 1 passed with 64 percent of the vote.\n\nTaxes on seniors\n\nAusley didn't push for increased taxes on seniors. Instead, she opposed cutting and eliminating the state's intangible tax.\n\nThis is ground PolitiFact Florida already has covered in a claim against Ausley from the Republican Party of Florida. Here are the details. The intangible tax, which was repealed by the Legislature in 2006, was a state tax paid on the value of investments such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, money market funds and unsecured notes. Savings accounts, pension funds, certificates of deposit and 401(k)s were not subject to the tax. The tax was paid mostly by middle- and upper-income Floridians who had those types of investments.\n\nOn several occasions, Ausley voted against repealing, or making cuts to the intangible tax. In 2001, she did vote for a more modest cut than Republicans were proposing.\n\nDemocrats argued that the benefit of the cut was largely to the wealthy and the loss of state revenue would hurt programs for the poor.\n\nThe tax, of course, didn't apply only to seniors. It applied to anyone who had those types of investments. And it didn't apply to things that would be traditionally considered retirement funds like a 401(k) or a pension.\n\nSummary\n\nThis fact check centers on Atwater's claim that \"Ausley's a financial train wreck for taxpayers -- pushing gas taxes, property taxes, taxes on seniors.\" First, we\u00a0want to mention that Atwater's ad also claims that Ausley \"wants total control of our money.\" That's incendiary and far-reaching rhetoric that cannot be supported by examining Ausley's statements or voting history. You should ignore the line.\n\n"}

Proponents said last week they had gathered more than 1 million signatures.\u00a0\n\n"}

We went to the Nexis transcript database to see how many times Corn appeared and what O\u2019Reilly said about him.\nCorn appeared on Fox News at least\u00a060 times.

Betty Sutton \"would rather riot with Occupy (Wall Street) than stand up for Ohio families.\"", "evidence": "Republicans moved quickly to politicize what federal agents have described as a failed bomb plot cooked up by anarchists connected to the Occupy Cleveland organization.\n\nThe group, an offshoot of last fall\u2019s anti-Wall Street demonstrations in New York, is not under investigation, officials stressed May 1, 2012, \u00a0when announcing the arrests of five suspects.\n\nBut that did little to stop the GOP from buzzing about the movement\u2019s support among Democrats.\n\nThe most direct attack came May 2, 2012, from the National Republican Congressional Committee. The group is working to unseat Rep. Betty Sutton, a Democrat from Copley Township near Akron. Redistricting put her into battle this fall against fellow Rep. Jim Renacci of Wadsworth.\n\nIn an email, the NRCC blasted Sutton for not immediately denouncing the accused anarchists and noted that the congresswoman attended an Occupy rally last October in New York.\n\nThe email, sent by NRCC Deputy Communications Director Andrea Bozek, accuses Sutton of missing votes to protest with Occupy Wall Street and being slow to criticize the \"plot by Occupy members to blow up an Ohio bridge.\"\n\nBozek then delivered the punchy email\u2019s parting shot.\n\n\"Sutton\u2019s cowardly silence shows she would rather riot with Occupy than stand up for Ohio families.\"\n\nWhen it comes to Occupy, it\u2019s no secret Sutton has been a supporter. But a rioter?\n\nPolitiFact Ohio decided to check that accusation.\n\nBozek provided a link to a story that was published last October in The Plain Dealer and online at Cleveland.com. The story reported on Sutton\u2019s travel to the Occupy rally in New York.\n\nBozek also shared an NRCC video montage of Occupy protesters preaching communism and engaging in other unruly behavior. An oft-used image of a man defecating on a police car makes a cameo. The video targets another congressional Democrat, Steve Israel of New York.\n\nAsked if any of the clips came from the event Sutton attended, Bozek replied: \"That video demonstrates the kind of behavior that defines this radical group. Multiple arrests, sexual assaults, attacks on police officers and \u2026 vandalism. Is that what Betty Sutton supports?\"\n\n\"The congresswoman does not ever condone or participate in riotous behavior,\" said Sutton spokesman Anthony DeAngelo.\n\nThe New York rally last fall is the only Occupy event Sutton has attended, DeAngelo told PolitiFact Ohio. We checked news reports from that day and found little to support the NRCC\u2019s attack.\n\nYes, there were violent outbursts -- an element necessary to meet nearly any modern definition of riot. The New York Times City Room blog reported that 23 people were arrested during the Oct. 5 protests, including one charged with second-degree riot -- a misdemeanor.\n\nAccording to New York penal code, rioting in the second degree occurs when someone in a group of at least four \"engages in tumultuous and violent conduct,\" risking \"public alarm.\"\n\nBut we suspect the New York Times would have noted an Ohio congresswoman among the group had Sutton been involved. But the newspaper didn\u2019t because Sutton wasn\u2019t. DeAngelo offered a few photos of his boss at the rally. Sutton appears more dressed up than her fellow demonstrators, and her dark coat and purple blouse look no worse for the wear.\n\nMost coverage of the Oct. 5 protests indicated that violent behavior was the exception. That evening, on CNN\u2019s broadcast of \"Situation Room,\" reporter Susan Candiotti agreed with host Wolf Blitzer that the protests had been peaceful and that \"there have been no confrontations.\"\n\nThe NRCC is correct that Sutton missed votes to attend the rally last October. It is also accurate to say that Sutton did not send out a formal condemnation of the five bomb plot suspects, though, in fairness, neither did Renacci until after the NRCC attack.\n\nBut the rhetorical flourish is where the NRCC\u2019s claim departs from truthfulness. The NRCC email said that Sutton\u2019s \"cowardly silence shows she would rather riot with Occupy than stand up for Ohio families.\"\n\nDid Sutton stand with the Occupy Wall Street protesters in October? Yes.\n\nDid she engage in rioting? No.\n\n"}

{"label": "pants-fire", "claim": "Scott Walker \"Wisconsin is broke,\" and \"state government is $3 billion in debt.\"", "evidence": "During the summer of 2011, the Republican-controlled state Legislature gave swift approval to the $66 billion 2011-\u201913 state budget, which was signed into law by Gov. Scott Walker.\n\nThat budget closed a $3.6 billion shortfall from the previous fiscal year, and also, for the first time in many years, closed the state\u2019s structural deficit. In fact, as we noted in an earlier item, Walker\u2019s budget is projected to leave a structural surplus at the end of the two years.\n\nThat\u2019s why we were puzzled by a two-page fund-raising appeal that his campaign mailed to supporters Sept. 2, 2011.\n\n\"Wisconsin state government is $3 billion in debt, spending is too high, our business climate isn\u2019t what it should be and Badger State voters gave me a mandate to turn our great state around,\" Walker said in the two-page letter.\n\n\"A fiscal tornado is barreling down on us at top speed. And we simply cannot continue spending, taxing, borrowing the way we have been,\" Walker added, declaring: \"Wisconsin is broke! This is our moment of reckoning. By dealing with our problems head-on and solving them, we\u2019ll win a victory for Wisconsin\u2019s future.\"\n\nWait a minute.\n\nThat does sound like something straight out of the campaign office -- but from the 2010 campaign.\n\nWe called Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie to ask about the statement. He said he knew nothing about the letter, and sent us to state Republican Party spokeswoman Katie McCallum. She said she would look into the letter and get back to us. She didn\u2019t.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the \"we\u2019re broke\" statement.\n\nThat was a refrain used by Walker (and other Republicans locally and nationally) on the campaign trail and in early 2011, when Walker introduced a budget repair bill that called for curtailing collective bargaining for most public employees.\n\nIn the midst of that debate, PolitiFact Wisconsin rated the \"we\u2019re broke\" statement False, noting that numerous experts said the state wasn\u2019t teetering on the brink of bankruptcy or insolvency, and had numerous tools available to deal with any shortfall -- even if some of the options, such as tax increases, were declared off limits by the GOP.\n\nWe heard from many readers who disagreed with that assessment.\n\nBut repeating the statement now flies in the face of the many positive statements Walker made after the budget passed.\n\nSignificantly, the state budget by law must be balanced, so the $3.6 billion shortfall had to be resolved. And the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau -- accepted by both sides as the neutral scorekeeper on such matters -- says the structural deficit is gone for the first time since it started using the calculation to measure the long-term impact of future obligations the state faces.\n\nHere\u2019s what Walker said when he signed the budget June 27, 2011: \"Through honest budgeting, we are providing an alternative to the reckless tricks and gimmicks of the past.\"\n\nWe asked Werwie whether Walker has recently used the \"broke\" phrase.\n\n\"He hasn\u2019t said that in eons,\" Werwie said.\n\nBeyond that, the state never was $3 billion in debt -- we rated a statement on that topic by GOP state Senate candidate Jonathan Steitz as False. Why? The state faced a $3.6 billion budget shortfall -- the difference between tax revenue projections and what agencies plan to spend in the next budget. But that\u2019s separate from any long-term debt obligations.\n\nThe contradictory statements in the letter also extend to comments about the state\u2019s business climate, which Walker said \"isn\u2019t what it should be.\"\n\nThe letter does not specify by what measure, but this also flies counter to what Walker has been stating publicly.\n\nHe routinely notes Wisconsin\u2019s standing improved from 41st to 24th on the list of business-friendly states compiled by Chief Executive magazine. A Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce survey found \"88 percent of Wisconsin business leaders said they are confident the state is heading in the right direction, up from just 10 percent a year ago.\"\n\nAnd Walker and GOP lawmakers note that their first actions this year came in a special session of the Legislature dedicated to steps aimed to improved the state\u2019s business climate.\n\nHere\u2019s what WMC president Kurt Bauer said July 11, 2011 in a column on the group\u2019s website.\n\n\"Governor Scott Walker set the right tone even before he took office by announcing the state was \u2018open for business.\u2019 Walker backed up his slogan by introducing a two-year budget plan that solved the $3.6 billion deficit without raising taxes. \"\n\nSaid Werwie: \"Certainly our business climate has gotten substantially better.\"\n\nOur conclusion\n\nIn a fund-raising letter full of urgency, Walker criticizes unions and Democrats in the Legislature while proclaiming the state is broke and $3 billion in debt. But the statement flies in the face of a balanced budget with a structural surplus and the upbeat rhetoric coming out of the governor\u2019s office.\n\nUnderstandable, perhaps. After all, the letter is geared toward getting supporters to contribute money to the campaign in the face of a possible recall attempt in 2012. But in doing so, Walker contradicts his own statements -- and reality.\n\nThe statements are false and ridiculous"}

That looks at how many people had insurance for all or part of the preceding year.\nThe Affordable Care Act was signed into law in 2010, but the individual health insurance mandate and most other core elements didn\u2019t take effect until 2014.\nUsing the 2010 survey is problematic since DHS changed its methodology and warns against comparing surveys before 2012 with those after. That doesn\u2019t make a big difference in this case, however, because the 2012 survey showed the same 94 percent insured rate as 2010.\nBut 2014 isn\u2019t necessarily a great choice for an \"after\" statistic, since it was a transition year. And there\u2019s more recent data available.\nDHS hasn\u2019t released the results of its 2015 survey yet, but the U.S. Census Bureau and other surveys have.\nAnd those numbers tell a different story than Johnson.\n\n"}

By email, Hunter told us he was referring to the so-called \"Cornhusker Kickback,\" which was a 2009 deal resulting in the Senate-approved version of the health care act giving Nebraska added federal Medicaid funds, as recapped by FactCheck.org in a December 2011 review. At the time the amendment was accepted, U.S. Sen.

{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Rick Scott's Starbucks heckler Says Rick Scott \"cut Medicaid\" so people can't \"get Obamacare.\"", "evidence": "It starts like a joke \u2014 Gov. Rick Scott walks into a Gainesville Starbucks \u2014 but one patron wasn\u2019t laughing.\nIn town on April 5, 2016, to tour the recently opened factory and headquarters for biopharmaceutical company Nanotherapeutics, Scott stopped in to the coffee chain for a cup. Cara Jennings, a former Lake Worth city commissioner, saw Scott and ripped into him from her seat. Among other grievances, she accused him of denying her health care coverage with his policies.\n\"In fact, you cut Medicaid so I couldn\u2019t get Obamacare,\" Jennings shouted on April 5, 2016. \"You are an a------! You don\u2019t care about working people. You don\u2019t care about working people. You should be ashamed to show your face around here.\"\nWhen Scott countered that the state had created a million jobs since the recession, she said no one cared (read our fact-check on those jobs numbers). She then criticized his March signing of a bill denying funding for women\u2019s health care clinics that performed abortions (read our check about that issue).\nWe tried to reach Jennings by phone, text, email and even Facebook, but we didn\u2019t hear back from her, so we don\u2019t really know the specifics of her situation. That makes it difficult to gauge whether she was able to benefit from the health care law.\nBut we can look at whether Scott cut Medicaid, the joint state and federal program to provide health insurance for the very poor, in a way that could have denied people health coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\nIt\u2019s not so much that he cut anything, but more that he hasn\u2019t consistently supported expanding the program. That has indeed left hundreds of thousands of Floridians without coverage.\nThe expansion debate \nJennings told ABC Action News in Tampa after the incident that she is a single mother who worked part-time. That provides clues that she may fall into what is known as the Medicaid coverage gap.\nTo understand why, let\u2019s review how the Affordable Care Act is linked to Medicaid.\nThe law originally wanted to cover uninsured people two different ways. One was to subsidize people who needed help buying insurance through state marketplaces or HealthCare.gov. The second was to expand Medicaid to cover a higher number of poorer people.\nNormally, to be eligible for Medicaid, your annual income has to be 44 percent of the federal poverty level (100 percent is currently $11,880 for an individual and $24,300 for a family of four). The plan was to extend that eligibility to all adults up to 138 percent of the poverty level. Technically the calculation under the law is 133 percent, but a 5 percent deduction is added on top of that.\nBut Medicaid expansion ended up being optional after a 2012 Supreme Court ruling saying it could not be forced upon states. Currently 19 states, including Florida, have chosen not to grow the program.\n\n"}

{"label": "false", "claim": "Dennis Kucinich \"We are giving almost $2 billion of taxpayer money to the junk food and fast food industries every year to make the (childhood obesity) epidemic worse.\"", "evidence": "Childhood obesity in the United States has more than tripled the last 30 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and the American Heart Association. It has reached epidemic levels and increased risks for heart disease, diabetes, stroke, cancer and osteoarthritis.\n\nThe inactivity associated with watching television has long taken much of the blame. But a recent UCLA study reported in the American Journal of Public Health found that commercials, not TV itself, were the link to obesity.\n\nIn fact, it found no association with television viewing and obesity for those who watched videos or commercial-free programming.\n\nFor Rep. Dennis Kucinich, the implication is clear: Taxpayers are subsidizing the obesity epidemic by providing tax breaks to the food industry for marketing fast food and junk food to children.\n\n\"We are giving almost $2 billion of taxpayer money to the junk food and fast food industries every year to make the (childhood obesity) epidemic worse,\" he said in a news release Nov. 10.\n\nThat whet our appetite for curiosity. So PolitiFact Ohio sank its teeth into Kucinich\u2019s claim that taxpayer dollars are used to market to bad food to children.\n\nOn the ills of fast food and marketing efforts, Kucinich cited a new study from the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University:\n\"The research is clear. Eating fast food harms young people\u2019s health,\" the study says. And it concludes that efforts to market fast food to children are both effective and rapidly expanding.\n\nThe fast food industry spent more than $4.2 billion in 2009 on TV commercials and radio, magazine, outdoor and other ads, the Rudd study said.\n\nThe industry spent nearly $2 billion in 2006 on marketing and advertising specifically aimed at children, according to a report to Congress from Federal Trade Commission.\n\nBut how do taxpayers subsidize that?\n\nThat answer is simple. Fast food marketers get the same break that other businesses do. The federal tax code allows companies to deduct \u00a0\"reasonable and necessary\" expenses of marketing and advertising from their income taxes.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sit well with Kucinich when the marketing targets kids. The Cleveland Democrat introduced a bill, HR 4310, to eliminate that tax deduction. The bill attracted 28 co-sponsors and has been referred to the Ways and Means Committee.\n\nKucinich's bill would prohibit any company from claiming a tax deduction for the expense of marketing fast food to children. Congress\u2019 Joint Committee on Taxation estimated \"on a very preliminary basis\" that the legislation could raise $15 billion to $19 billion in additional federal revenue over the 10-year budget period -- \"which is almost 2 billion per year,\" said Kucinich\u2019s press aide.\n\nA revenue estimate from the Joint Committee is treated as confidential unless released by the member of Congress who requested it. Confidentiality allows the committee staff to maintain its nonpartisan role in the policy process.\n\nKucinich\u2019s office gave us a copy of the staff letter with the committee\u2019s estimate, but we were unable to get background details. But the letter notes that a number of unsettled issues surround the bill -- ranging from defining \"fast food restaurant\" or \"food of a poor nutritional quality\" to determining what constitutes advertising that is \"primarily aimed at\" children -- and all of those issues would affect the bill\u2019s impact (including the amount of new tax revenue).\n\nThe committee\u2019s estimate clearly covered more than the child-oriented fast food advertising in the 2006 FTC survey. At the top corporate tax rate of 35 percent, the $2 billion cited in that report would have yielded about $700 million in additional tax revenue.\n\nA study from the National Bureau of Economic Research does support Kucinich\u2019s assertion that eliminating the tax break would reduce the number of overweight children. Eliminating the tax deduction would reduce the number of overweight children by 5 to 7 percent, it said, \u00a0and banning advertising to children would prompt an even larger reduction.\n\nSo where does that leave us on Kucinich\u2019s assertion?\n\u00a0\n\n"}

But 17,000 fewer New Jersey residents were employed in June than May. \n\nMore people have found work since Christie took office, but not as many as the governor claimed. \n\nChristie said 90,000 people found work during his time in Trenton. That figure actually represents the number of private-sector jobs -- 89,700 -- New Jersey has added since February 2010, Christie\u2019s first full month in office. \n\nOver the same time frame, nearly 39,000 New Jersey residents found employment, less than half the figure Christie cited. \n\nSo what gives?\n\nA job created in a state does not mean an unemployed resident returned to work. \n\nThe federal labor department counts jobs through a survey of employers called the payroll survey. \"We don't know how many people that represents,\" said Gary Steinberg, a spokesman for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, because a person may hold more than one job.\n\nTo count the number of employed residents, the federal labor department relies on a survey of households. In that survey, individuals are classified as employed, unemployed or not in the labor force by their place of residence, even if their job is in another state.\n\nAnd by that measure, Christie\u2019s figures for the number of New Jersey residents who have returned to work are off.\n\nBrian Murray, a spokesman for the state labor department, said: \"On every other occasion for the past week during which the Governor has addressed this topic in public, he has correctly stated that we gained 9,900 jobs in June and nearly 90,000 jobs since his first full month in office. \u00a0To pounce on this is ridiculous and petty.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nChristie said that 9,900 New Jerseyans returned to work in June and almost 90,000 residents are \"back to work now since I became governor.\"\n\nChristie wrongly represents job gains as individuals returning to work.

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Bob Ryan Outside of recall elections, \"there's never been a public official removed from office\" in Wisconsin \"for anything but malfeasance in office.\"", "evidence": "Defiant Sheboygan Mayor Bob Ryan-- whose drinking problems have spurred scorn from citizens, humiliation on YouTube and ridicule from Jay Leno -- says he would become a singular figure in the history of Wisconsin government if his Common Council succeeds in removing him from office.\n\nWisconsin witnessed a historic set of nine recall elections in the summer of 2011. Voters removed two Republican state senators from office.\n\nBut Ryan, whose city calls itself the bratwurst capital of the world, claims his removal would be unique -- partly because it would not involve a recall.\n\nOn Aug. 15, 2011, the Sheboygan Common Council launched a process that could eventually take Ryan, who has resisted calls to resign, out of office. If the move plays out, Ryan essentially would be put on trial with the council acting as judge and jury, according to a Sheboygan Press article and Sheboygan City Attorney Steve McLean.\n\nRyan made his claim to aldermen during the Aug. 15 council meeting, according to WBAY-TV in Green Bay.\n\n\"This whole thing stinks. If you want to take me out of office, by all means start your recall,\" he said. \"If you want to go down this path, it's not a threat, it's a fact, it's never been done. There's never been a public official removed from office in this state for anything but malfeasance in office. I'm here to do a job. I will continue to do that job. You should know by now, I never quit. Ever.\"\n\nFor us, the key claim is this sentence:\n\n\"There's never been a public official removed from office in this state for anything but malfeasance in office.\"\n\nNever is a long time.\n\nRyan didn\u2019t return our call and emails over two days asking him to clarify his claim and to provide evidence for it.\n\n\"Public official,\" for example, could mean an elected official or an appointed one, such as a school superintendent. But our sense is Ryan was referring to elected officials like himself being removed by a governmental body, and not the voters.\n\nRyan has argued that his drinking -- he has admitted to being an alcoholic -- has not affected his duties as mayor.\n\nThe saga in Sheboygan, a Lake Michigan community of about 50,000 people 60 miles north of Milwaukee, began in September 2009, six months after Ryan, 48, was elected mayor. He called a news conference to apologize for making a sexually explicit remark about his wife\u2019s sister. Ryan\u2019s remark was captured on video, posted on YouTube, became fodder for Jay Leno and led the Common Council to censure him.\n\nThe drama intensified in July 2011, when news surfaced that Ryan was issued a warning by police after a weekend of drinking at taverns in Elkhart Lake, becoming rude and obnoxious and passing out at least once. The Common Council voted to begin the removal process after Ryan refused its call to resign.\n\nTo see whether Ryan\u2019s claim is correct, we contacted a number of experts.\n\nThey include state government entities -- the Legislative Reference Bureau, the Historical Society, the Department of Public Instruction and the Judicial Commission; statewide associations -- the League of Municipalities, the Counties Association and the Association of School Boards; political scientists -- Dennis Dresang of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Joe Heim of the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse; and Milwaukee historian John Gurda.\n\nHere\u2019s what we found:\n\nFatal shooting: In 1842, six years before Wisconsin became a state, James Vineyard, a member of the Territorial Legislature\u2019s version of the state Senate, shot and killed fellow member Charles C.P. Arndt during an argument after a legislative session adjourned. Vineyard was expelled from the legislature after it refused to accept his resignation, although he was acquitted of manslaughter at trial, according to the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau and the Wisconsin Historical Society.\n\nGiven that the shooting occurred on the legislative floor, it could be fairly argued that the removal was related to misconduct in office. So, that one does not directly undercut Ryan\u2019s claim.\n\nFelony crimes: At least four state lawmakers have been removed from office after being convicted of a felony. But under state law, the expulsions were automatic -- no action needed to be taken by the Legislature -- so that makes their removals different than Ryan\u2019s would be.\n\nCrimes not directly related to official duties also have led to removals that were not automatic. For example, the New Holstein School Board fired Christopher J. Nelson, the district\u2019s superintendent, after he was charged in February 2011 with trying to set up a sexual encounter with a person he thought was a 15-year-old boy. That could undercut Ryan\u2019s claim, but Nelson was an appointed official, not elected.\n\nNon-criminal removal: In 1992, the state Supreme Court removed Racine County Circuit Court Judge Jon Skow from the bench after he admitted he was permanently disabled from stress and depression. The high court determined that Skow, who suffered from alcoholism, could not carry out his duties. He previously had been suspended following a number of incidents, including leaving the bench during a trial.\n\nThat case does undercut Ryan\u2019s claim, since the judge was not removed for malfeasance in office.\n\nAs rare as removals from office appear to be, at least two other Wisconsin mayors have been targeted for removal since 2008.\n\nThe Common Council in Montello, 60 miles north of Madison, removed Mayor Frank Breitenbach in August 2008 for reasons related to misconduct in office, according to the Wisconsin State Journal. He faced 15 allegations by city employees and residents, including using profanity with employees and threatening to fire Montello's police chief without legal authority.\n\nIn Marinette, a Lake Michigan community 120 miles north of Sheboygan, a Common Council committee recommended hiring a special prosecutor in an effort to remove Mayor Robert Harbick from office. Harbick had pleaded no contest to first-offense drunken-driving, which is a traffic violation in Wisconsin. But the removal process failed to proceed when the proposal to hire the attorney failed in a 4-4 vote before the full council in August 2011.\n\nLet\u2019s review what we\u2019ve found.\n\nThe embattled Sheboygan mayor said no public official in Wisconsin has ever been removed from office \"for anything but malfeasance in office.\" Ryan\u2019s reference was not to recall elections or automatic removal, but removal by a governmental body such as a city council.\n\nOur sense is it\u2019s likely the mayor was speaking of elected officials, and we could find only one instance, involving a judge, in which a removal was not for misconduct in office. We also found a school superintendent fired by a school board following the filing of criminal charges, but he did not hold an elected position.\n\nThis is a statement we could revisit if more information surfaces; after all we\u2019re talking about more than 150 years of history and countless governmental entities in Wisconsin"}

The \"cool\" reference wasn\u2019t to forcing some women to get vaginal ultrasounds, but rather to the ultrasound technology that produces images from the womb.\nNevertheless, there is no question that for decades -- going back to before his time as governor and as a state lawmaker -- Walker has been staunchly anti-abortion.\nBaldwin\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to our requests for information to back her claim, and Walker\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t weigh in, either.

Michael Doherty wants to see action taken immediately to address what he considers a fraudulent practice in many New Jersey municipalities where property values are being lowered to secure more school aid from the state.\n\nIn a Feb. 28 interview on NJToday, Doherty claimed that activity was documented in a report issued by the state comptroller.\n\n\"And the other one was a report by our state comptroller, Matthew Boxer, and he pointed out that many towns are artificially lowering the real estate values that they report to Trenton, and they do that because that also means they get hundreds of millions of dollars of additional school aid,\" Doherty (R-Warren) said. \"This is the kind of fraud that needs to be addressed immediately.\"\n\nFraud? Money? PolitiFact New Jersey was intrigued.\n\nBut after reviewing the comptroller\u2019s August 2010 report, we found that Doherty is exaggerating its findings.\n\nThe comptroller\u2019s report shows that some municipalities \"artificially\" reduce property tax collections through the use of tax abatements, possibly leading to the increased need for school aid, according to the report.\n\nHowever, tax abatements are allowed under state law and don\u2019t represent an act of \"fraud.\" Also, while such abatements may indirectly generate additional school aid, their purpose is to attract investment to areas in need of redevelopment or rehabilitation.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s explain what a tax abatement is.\n\nThrough tax abatements, municipalities reduce or eliminate property tax bills for certain landowners, who are typically businesses and developers. In the case of long-term abatements, property owners are exempt from paying taxes, but must contribute so-called \"payments in lieu of taxes,\" or PILOTs.\n\nBut none of that PILOT money goes to the local school districts, which also are losing the property tax revenue. As a result, such tax abatements may increase the need for state aid, according to the comptroller\u2019s report.\n\n\"The school district still needs the state aid at the enhanced level since the district itself does not see the benefit of the PILOT amounts, and taxpayers throughout the state pay the resulting bill,\" according to the report.\n\nSo, Doherty is correct that tax abatements may result in sending more school aid to those communities.\n\nBut we found two problems with Doherty\u2019s characterization of tax abatements.\n\nFirst, Doherty\u2019s \"fraud\" claim suggests that such practices are somehow illegal. The comptroller\u2019s report raises multiple concerns about the tax abatement process, but still indicates that such tax exemptions are permitted under state law.\n\nSecondly, Doherty suggested that the purpose of tax abatements was to generate additional school aid.\n\nBut tax abatements are meant to \"encourage rehabilitation and redevelopment of distressed areas,\" according to the comptroller\u2019s report. The increase in municipal revenue through PILOTs also was cited by some officials \"as a motivation to grant abatements,\" the report states.\n\nThe comptroller\u2019s report does not claim the purpose of tax abatements is to receive more school aid, according to Peter McAleer, spokesman for the comptroller\u2019s office.\n\nMcAleer told us that determining such a purpose \"would require reading the minds of those who grant the abatements, and it\u2019s impossible to make an across-the-board conclusion about the state of mind of hundreds of different local officials.\"\n\nBut Doherty argued that municipalities are manipulating the numbers and school districts are using the low real estate values as justification for demanding greater school aid.\n\n\"So my statement is 100 percent accurate,\" Doherty told us. \"I see the big picture...I see how it affects the school funding formula and the distribution of school aid.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn an NJToday interview, Doherty said, according to the comptroller\u2019s report, many municipalities are \"artificially lowering\" real estate values to secure more school aid, a practice he referred to as \"fraud.\"\n\nThe senator is right that tax abatements may lead to greater school aid in communities with these tax-exempt properties.

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Richard Saslaw $65 million from ABC privatization will not pay for \"even an overpass in Tysons Corner.\"", "evidence": "Virginia Senate Majority Leader Richard Saslaw hasn\u2019t hidden his opposition to ABC privatization, scoffing at predictions that auctioning off retail liquor licenses will generate major money for state roads.\n\nAfter his first plan for total privatization stalled, Gov. Bob McDonnell is now exploring turning over only the the retail operation to the private sector.\n\nAccording to a Washington Post report, Saslaw recently told the Alexandria City Council that if auctioning off the retail licenses generated $300 million (close to the original plan\u2019s estimate), Northern Virginia could see between $60 million to $65 million.\n\nThat\u2019s \"not even an overpass in Tysons Corner,\" Saslaw reportedly said.\n\nWell, $65 million is more than couple cups of coffee, so we wondered if his claim was true.\n\nPolitiFact Virginia attempted unsuccessfully to reach Saslaw. Because we don\u2019t know if he had a particular overpass in mind, we took a broad look at the cost of building one in Northern Virginia.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the basics. Based on the cost of construction alone, Saslaw\u2019s claim runs into trouble.\n\nKendal Walus, the state bridge engineer with the Virginia Department of Transportation, said the most recent estimates to build a bridge in Virginia is $237 per square foot. Of the 65 bridges built last year, the average square footage was 22,400.\n\nThat would make the cost for the average overpass about $5.3 million. But that figure doesn\u2019t include the various other costs involved like engineering and land acquisition. And those vary.\n\n\"There could be quite a bit of range depending on how complex the bridges are,\" said Eric Teitelman, chief of the projects and operations division of the Fairfax County Department of Transportation. \"Of course, land cost can be a wild card in this whole thing. Tysons is a pretty expensive real estate area.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTeitelman estimated the average cost of an overpass in Northern Virginia at between $35 million to $40 million excluding land acquisition, but said it could soar as high as $100 million with a high elevation flyover.\n\n\"If you are talking just an overpass, not an interchange, $65 million should cover the construction cost,\" added John D. Lynch, an engineer with VDOT. \"However, a lot depends on impacts of the new bridge. \u00a0If significant right of way and/or utility impacts are realized, or impacts to existing businesses, these costs would escalate quickly.\"\n\nTo get a better sense of normal costs, including land acquisition, we looked at a few projects underway and coming up in Northern Virginia.\n\nAn interchange getting underway at Fairfax County Parkway and Fair Lakes Parkway, for example, is estimated to cost $69.5 million. But that includes two overpasses and three miles worth of road widening. So, if we cut that in half, a single overpass and some of the widening work would be close to $35 million. \u00a0\n\nIn nearby Manassas, a four-lane overpass underway at Route 28 and Wellington Road is estimated to cost $44 million. Plans to replace the Washington Boulevard Bridge over Columbia Pike in Arlington -- part of the Pentagon Roadway Network -- is estimated to cost just under $60 million. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nSummary\n\nSaslaw says that if Northern Virginia were to receive $60 million to $65 million it wouldn\u2019t be enough to cover the cost of an overpass in Tysons Corner.\n\nBased on the officials we spoke with, it\u2019s possible that a major interchange in Tysons Corner could cost that much or more, especially when the cost of land acquisition is included. But our interviews and most of the examples cited by the officials indicate that Saslaw\u2019s estimate is on the high end"}
{"label": "true", "claim": "Gwen Moore In Wisconsin, \"deaths from domestic violence are at the highest in 10 years.\"", "evidence": "When U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.) was honored by the National Network to End Domestic Violence, she issued a statement saying \"we have a real crisis on our hands.\"\n\nIn Wisconsin, her Oct. 7, 2010, statement read, \"deaths from domestic violence are at the highest in 10 years.\"\n\nIndeed, eight days earlier, the Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence released a report that made that claim.\n\nAccording to her spokesman, Moore based her statement on a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article about the report. The article said domestic violence \"claimed 67 lives\" in 2009.\n\nWe wondered: Does that mean domestic abusers killed 67 people? And is that number, as Moore claimed, a 10-year high?\n\nThe Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence, like the national organization that honored Moore, is an advocacy group committed to ending domestic violence. It has produced a \"domestic violence homicide report\" each year since 2000, using data from crime report summaries from local police agencies and from various news articles.\n\nThe coalition defines homicide as \"the killing of one human being by another.\"\n\nBut its annual homicide reports actually count more than that.\n\nAs in previous years, the 67 deaths in the 2009 report included homicides in commonly understood domestic violence cases -- such as when the victims and perpetrators were spouses or partners, former spouses or partners, or adults with children in common.\n\nHomicides of other people are counted if, for example, a woman\u2019s current boyfriend kills the woman\u2019s former boyfriend; if a third person trying to protect a domestic violence victim kills the perpetrator; or if the domestic violence victim kills the perpetrator in self-defense.\n\nBut the Wisconsin coalition -- as it clearly notes in its report -- also adds suicides committed by domestic violence perpetrators. For example, it counts the January 2009 death of a Fond du Lac County man who took his own life after shooting his wife to death outside their home.\n\nAll told, the coalition says that in 2009, \"there were 47 domestic violence homicide incidents resulting in 67 deaths -- 52 homicides and 15 perpetrator suicides.\"\n\nMany people would not consider a domestic violence perpetrator who committed suicide to be a domestic violence victim. The coalition says it has always included perpetrator suicides in its annual tallies because they occurred as a result of a domestic violence incident, said spokesman Tony Gibart.\n\nBy the coalition\u2019s count, the 67 total deaths in 2009 was the highest in 10 years, exceeding the previous high of 61 in 2003.\n\nExcluding the suicides, the 52 other domestic violence homicides also were the highest in 10 years, exceeding the previous high of 45 in 2003. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nSo, Moore accurately quoted the group\u2019s statistics, and those statistics have been consistently handled -- even though including the suicides increases the number.\n\nWe checked a few other states for how they tally domestic violence deaths:\n\n\u00a0\n\n"}

As with other dramatic talking points we\u2019ve seen over the years, this one has been repeated and repeated over a decade and a half without being updated, despite evidence that the underlying trends have changed direction.\nThe statistic dates back to a 2003 paper published by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a division of the U.S. Justice Department. The Bureau of Justice Statistics paper includes the line, \"About 1 in 3 black males ... are expected to go to prison during their lifetime, if current incarceration rates remain unchanged.\"\nBy contrast, the paper said, one of every six Hispanic males and one of every 17 white males can be expected to go to prison during their lifetime. (For this fact-check, we\u2019ll ignore Sanders\u2019 imprecise use of \"jail,\" where people are held temporarily, rather than \"prison,\" where inmates are typically serving substantial sentences.)\nNot only was this data published 12 years ago, but the paper is based on data from 2001 -- a full 14 years ago. Despite its age, the statistic has been cited repeatedly -- notably in 2013 with the publication of a report by the Sentencing Project, a group that advocates for prison reform and promotes alternatives to incarceration. That report\u2019s claim -- that \"if current trends continue, one of every three black American males born today can expect to go to prison in his lifetime\" -- was footnoted to a 2011 paper by Marc Mauer, the Sentencing Project\u2019s executive director.\nWhen we contacted Mauer, he said he doesn\u2019t know of any updated research that would shed light on the percentage today. \"It's a very complex analysis to produce, so that's at least part of the reason that it hasn't been replicated in recent years,\" Mauer said.\n\n"}

{"label": "false", "claim": "We Love USA PAC Ron Klein \"sponsored an amendment that specifically allows price gouging.\"", "evidence": "A political action committee entered the fray between U.S. Rep. Ron Klein, D-Boca Raton, and his Republican challenger Allen West. The \"We Love USA\"\u00a0PAC\u00a0is not in love with Klein -- the group's website features an image of Klein dangling from puppet strings being directed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The entrance of a PAC isn't surprising in this big-money District 22 battleground in South Florida.\n\nWhen we first spotted the website on Sept. 24, 2010, it had a video posted called \"Klein passing gas.\" A few days later we found the same video on YouTube\u00a0though the date was June 18, 2008 -- during Klein's previous re-election bid when he also faced West.\n\nThe 1-minute, 16-second video focuses on gasoline prices. Near the start, text on the screen states, \"While the prices at the pump are skyrocketing, Ron Klein speaks strong...\" The video shows an undated clip of him apparently speaking on the House floor about giving the Federal Trade Commission \"the authority to crack down on the people who price gouge.\" Then the text says \"But Klein lies! ... Ron Klein sponsored an amendment that specifically allows price gouging.\"\n\nWe wanted to know, did Klein sponsor an amendment related to gas prices that \"specifically allows price gouging\"? In South Florida, with limited public transportation options, residents rely heavily on cars -- so gas prices matter to many voters. And in a region prone to gas shortages caused by hurricanes, we're sensitive to the issue of gouging.\n\nThe video mixes narration, text and photos. The images show a gas station with prices as high as $5.199 a gallon and a blurry image of Klein in front of another station. The text cites an amendment to H.R. 3355 offered by Klein on Nov. 8, 2007, and claims it was \"to modify the instruction prohibiting price gouging by replacing it with language discouraging price gouging, thereby legalizing price gouging.\"\n\nIt continues: \"Middle-class families and their increasingly tight budgets need relief. Not more lies and broken promises. Floridians are paying twice as much at the gas pump as when Ron Klein came to office in 2006... Every time we pump gas into our car or truck, we should remember that Ron Klein allows price gouging!\" In the background, Gwen Stefani's sultry voice can be heard singing the hit single \"Don't Speak\" by No Doubt.\n\nFirst, some background -- and we could find little -- about We Love USA.\n\nThe group's website states that the PAC was set up on Sept. 23, 2010, and that \"Our core mission is simple; showing the voters how the candidates have voted during the Obama administration. Those in Congress who voted with Pelosi on every single important bill are trying to hide their record thru\u00a0negative attacks and denial of their near unanimous voting with her. We will do our best to not let the voters forget where these politicians stand on the issues.\"\n\nFEC reports\u00a0show that the PAC filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission Sept. 21 and lists Nancy Watkins, of the accounting firm Robert Watkins and Company\u00a0in Tampa, as the treasurer. The PAC filed an FEC report Sept. 28 showing it had spent $62,652 on advertising.\n\nIn an interview with the Miami Herald editorial board Sept. 27, both West and Klein said that they had nothing to do with the PAC. The PAC responded to e-mails about the gas video but not about the PAC itself. Nor did anyone return phone calls.\n\nAbout three hours after our first e-mail Sept. 27 asking about the gas video, the PAC responded that it had taken down the video.\n\n\"Thank you for bringing to our attention that we should provide links to fact check our videos and statements we place on this website,'' said the e-mail signed \"Media Relations.\" \"We have pulled the video 'Ron Klein Pass Gas' as it stated that Ron Klein came to office in 2006. In 2006, Ron Klein became Congressman-Elect, and officially took office in January 2007. Because of this oversight, we have decided to take the video off of the website.\"\n\nBut the PAC still stood behind the claim about price gouging, and Mark Laffler of We Love USA e-mailed us the amendments cited in the ad.\n\nLet's look at H.R. 3355. The bill, sponsored by Klein in 2007, was called the \"Homeowners Defense Act of 2007.\" The bill was to provide federal support for state-sponsored insurance programs to help homeowners facing natural catastrophes such as hurricanes. On Nov. 8, 2007, U.S. Rep. Ginny Brown-Waite, a Republican who represents west-central Florida, introduced an amendment\u00a0to \"prohibit price gouging in any disaster area located within the State.\"\n\nThe amendment defines price gouging as: \"providing of any consumer good or service by a supplier related to repair or restoration of property damaged from a catastrophe for a price that the supplier knows or has reason to know is greater, by at least the percentage set forth in a State law or regulation prohibiting such act (not withstanding any real cost increase due to any attendant business risk and other reasonable expenses that result from the major catastrophe involved), than the price charged by the supplier for such consumer good or service immediately before the disaster.\"\n\nKlein responded with his own amendment to strike \"prohibit\" and insert \"discourage.\" He wanted to soften that price-gouging language because he didn't want to set up a barrier to many states joining the national disaster consortium.\n\nThe overall bill passed the House, 258-155, on Nov. 8, 2007, but stalled in the Senate. The Homeowners Defense Act of 2010, H.R. 2555,\u00a0sponsored by Klein is pending.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make Klein soft on gasoline price gouging though. We found three laws he voted for that were specifically aimed at prohibiting gas price gouging or limiting gas prices:\n\n\u2022 Klein was one of 125 co-sponsors and voted for the \"Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act\" H.R. 1252\u00a0in 2007. It would have made it illegal during an emergency to sell gas at an excessive price. That bill stalled in a Senate committee. A related bill, H.R. 6346\u00a0the Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act in 2008, failed to become law though Klein did vote for it.\n\n\u2022 Klein voted for the Gas Price Relief for Consumers Act of 2008 H.R. 6074,\u00a0which would have\u00a0made it illegal for foreign states to act together to limit the production of gas or set the price. The related Senate bill S. 879\u00a0had hearings but no vote.\n\n\u2022 Klein voted for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Fill Suspension and Consumer Protection Act of 2008 H.R. 6022. It passed and \"directs the Secretary of the Interior to suspend petroleum acquisition for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve through the royalty-in-kind program\" through the end of 2008. Pelosi called for the move to bring down gas prices. This bill was signed into law by President George W. Bush on May 19, 2008.\n\nWe also wanted to check the ad's claim that gas prices doubled during Klein's tenure in Congress. The PAC, in an e-mail, wrote that the price of gas doubled in 2008 and sent us a link to GasBuddy\u00a0for historical gas prices in Miami -- which is outside of Klein's Congressional district.\n\nWe contacted AAA and asked for gas prices for January 2006, January 2007 and the most recent month available in 2010 for Fort Lauderdale -- part of the city lies within the district. AAA\u2019s chart showed a gallon of unleaded gas cost $2.3855 in January 2006, $2.3074 in January 2007, and $2.7175 in September 2010. AAA figures show the average price rose to more than $4 in 2008 in Fort Lauderdale, though the peak was still more than 50 cents short of doubling from the start of Klein\u2019s term.\n\nLet's review: the We Love USA PAC had a video on its website that stated \"Klein sponsored an amendment that specifically allows price gouging.\" Klein's amendment was to change the wording from \"prohibit\" price gouging to \"discourage.\" The PAC interprets \"discourage\" to mean \"specifically allows,\" which is a stretch. Further, the video suggests to the viewer that the amendment was about gas prices -- but the bill was about homeowners insurance and property damage"}

And where is this \"most polluted rivers\" list he alludes to?\nWe\u2019ll get to that. First, some background on why Richardson and others, including Gov. Roy Cooper, are so worried about the Cape Fear, in particular.\u00a0\nThis summer it came to light that the Chemours plant near Fayetteville may have improperly dumped a chemical called GenX into the Cape Fear, which provides drinking water for much of southeastern North Carolina.\nGenX is used to make Teflon, the nonstick substance that Chemours makes at its Fayetteville Works plant. The state is accusing the company and its predecessor, DuPont, of failing to inform regulators that they were releasing GenX into the river \u2014 and earlier this month the state sued Chemours over the discharges.\nMeanwhile, Cooper and other Democratic legislators want to allot more resources to DEQ so the department can research the spill\u2019s effects. But they\u2019re mad because the Republican-controlled legislature in June cut DEQ\u2019s budget by $1.8 million over the next two years, and DEQ\u2019s leader says the department doesn\u2019t have the funds needed to deal with the Cape Fear chemical pollution long-term.\nEnter Richardson and his claim about North Carolina being home to two of the top five \"most polluted\" rivers in the country.\nThe dangers of hog waste\nRichardson wasn't immediately available for comment. His assistant, Leigh Lawrence, said Richardson was referencing the 2017 edition of the American Rivers organization\u2019s annual \"America\u2019s most endangered rivers\" list. The list ranks the Cape Fear and Neuse together as the seventh most endangered rivers in America.\nOn the phone, Lawrence acknowledged that Richardson might\u2019ve misspoke but that he \"cares deeply\" about the environment, referencing a bill he filed earlier this year to try to protect part of the Cape Fear from regulation rollbacks.\u00a0\nRichardson, for his part, later called PolitiFact to say that he once\u00a0saw a list of America's most polluted rivers that supports his argument \u2013 but that he's had trouble finding it. Regardless of any lists or rankings, he said, the rivers have serious issues that need to be addressed.\n\"My intention was not to mislead anyone,\" Richardson said. \"Between the numerous articles that point to the troubles on the Neuse and Cape fear basin ... and then you throw in GenX, it\u2019s clear we\u2019ve got a huge issue that we\u2019re not dealing with.\"\nNonetheless, American Rivers told PolitiFact that their \"most endangered\" list shouldn\u2019t be viewed as a \"most polluted\" list. In fact, the first page of the report says: \"This report is not a list of the nation\u2019s 'worst'\u00a0or most polluted rivers, but rather it highlights rivers confronted by critical decisions that will determine their future.\"\n\"The big difference between \u2019most polluted\u2019 and \u2018most endangered\u2019 is that when we list a river as \u2018most endangered\u2019 it is because there is a decision that is coming up that depending on how that decision is made will have a major impact on the river,\" said Peter Raabe, the group\u2019s conservation director for rivers of Southern Appalachia and the Carolinas.\n\n"}

After checking with diplomatic and presidential historians, we found that Trump has a point, but his claim is far from airtight.\nAirport greetings aren\u2019t only from heads of state\nOn March 20 at Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed International Airport near Havana, the president was \"greeted by a delegation of American and Cuban officials, including \u2026 Bruno Rodr\u00edguez Parrilla, the Cuban foreign minister,\" the New York Times reported.\nSo neither Fidel Castro, the communist government\u2019s founding leader, or Raul Castro, his brother and successor, was at the airport to greet Obama. Fidel Castro is in poor health, but Raul Castro met Pope Francis at the airport in February. And he also met the Russian Orthodox Patriarch at the airport when he arrived that month.\nTrump has \"a legitimate point,\" said Paul Kengor, a biographer of Ronald Reagan. \"It did make Obama look bad, especially given that the Castro brothers should be enormously grateful\" that an American president would agree to start warming relations between the two countries.\nThat said, Trump\u2019s wording in his speech -- that \"no leader was there, nobody, to greet him\" -- wasn\u2019t really accurate. Bruno Rodr\u00edguez Parrilla, the foreign minister, is a high-ranking official in the Cuban government. So is Cuban Ambassador to the U.S. Jose Cabanas, who was also there.\nIndeed, the White House said at the time said that it was never envisioned that one of the Castros would come to the airport to greet Air Force One.\n\"The White House says it's taking no offense that Cuban President Raul Castro didn't greet President Barack Obama upon arrival in Havana,\" the Associated Press reported. \"Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser, says it was \u2018never contemplated or discussed\u2019 that Castro would be at the airport. He said the Cubans consider Monday morning's ceremony with Obama and Castro to be the official welcome event.\"\nWhite House spokesman Ned Price told PolitiFact that there is \"not a standard recipe\" for how protocol of this sort is handled. \"If the official arrival ceremony is separate from the airport arrival, as was the case in Cuba, it's certainly not atypical for someone other than the head of state to greet Air Force One,\" Price said.\nIndependent experts agreed.\nNick Cullather, a diplomatic historian at Indiana University, said he doubted any snub was felt when Obama recently traveled to the United Kingdom and was met at Stansted Airport by Essex Lord Lieutenant Lord John Petre, a designee of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n"}

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., went a step further than the candidate himself in describing his disdain for corporate cash.\n\"One major reason I support Bernie is his consistency when things are hard. Not only does Bernie reject corporate money in 2020, he\u2019s also never taken corporate lobbyist money in his *entire political career*,\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted, using asterisks for emphasis. \"He is a real one.

That\u2019s not the case.\u00a0\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, when Sanders finished as runner-up to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, it was reported that Sanders had received money from nearly two dozen registered federal lobbyists, including one from the National Mining Association.\u00a0\nAnd figures compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan nonprofit that tracks federal campaign contributions, show Sanders has received $3.35 million from \"lawyers and lobbyists\" since 1989.\n\"Corporate lobbyist\" isn\u2019t a precise term. But we can check Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s claim based on whether Sanders has ever taken contributions from lobbyists who represent corporations, even if they amount to only a tiny percentage of all his campaign money.\u00a0\nIn fact, there have been a number of such instances, dating back more than a decade.\nIn his current campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, Sanders has received contributions from at least two federally registered lobbyists. They include $100 from EY lobbyist Dave Koshgarian, whose clients include Boeing Co., MetLife Inc. and New York Life Insurance; and $27 from Netflix lobbyist Josh Korn.\nThe center told us it has not done a more complete analysis of lobbyist contributions to Sanders.\nBut we found that some larger donations were made in previous campaigns.\u00a0\n\n"}
{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Bloggers Forty aides who serve President Barack Obama \"owe $333,485 in back taxes.\"", "evidence": "April 15, the deadline for filing 2012 income tax returns, is almost here, so it was fitting that a claim about income taxes caught our attention the other day. The claim circulated in the blogosphere and some media reports, then showed up in a published letter to the editor of The Plain Dealer.\n\n\nThe claim: Forty aides who serve President Barack Obama \"owe $333,485 in back taxes.\"\n\n\nSounds outrageous, yes? And after checking with the Internal Revenue Service, we can affirm that the claim is factually correct. Yet there is more to the story. ,\n\n\nIt turns out that the issue arises every year, regardless of who is president. And it applies to nearly every department of the federal government.\n\n\n\"People who work for the federal government are no different from people who work in the private sector or for nonprofits,\" said Kay Bell, a Texas-based author, journalist, blogger (\"Don\u2019t Mess With Taxes\"), former congressional staffer and current contributing tax editor for BankRate.com. We contacted her because she has written about the government employee delinquencies for years. \"Everybody has tax issues,\" she said.\n\n\nLet\u2019s break this down with numbers first, then provide some context. We got the latest numbers in an Excel spreadsheet from an IRS spokesman. His agency developed a reporting method in 1992 to comply with a congressional requirement that it provide annual reports on the tax delinquencies of federal employees.\n\n\nIn 2011, the last year for which the filing deadline has long passed, 3.62 percent of the civilian federal workforce -- or 107,658 individuals out of 2.97 million federal workers -- had an unresolved federal income tax delinquency.\n\n\nThis did not include taxpayers who have made arrangements with the IRS to pay off their tax debts. Rather, these are people who have not, cannot or will not pay.\n\n\nThe numbers we presented so far include only federal civilian employees, not military personnel or retirees, because of the implicit rationale made in criticizing these workers: Those who carry out the regular functions of government ought to be keenly aware of the need to pay their taxes. Altogether, these tax delinquents owed just over $1 billion.\n\n\nBut if you add active military members, reservists, National Guard and federal retirees, the number of delinquent individuals grows to 311,566, \u00a0and the total owed climbs to $3.5 billion.\n\n\nAmong the major federal departments, the Department of Housing and Urban Development had the highest delinquency rate, 4.42 percent. In exact numbers, 431 HUD employees owed a cumulative $5.9 million.\n\n\nAmong large independent agencies, workers in the Government Printing Office were the worst tax delinquents: 167 employees, or 7.6 percent of the agency\u2019s workforce, owed back taxes, to the tune of $2.3 million.\n\n\nAs for the White House, the Executive Office of the President had 40 tax delinquencies out of its 1,902-member staff in 2011, for a rate of 2.10 percent. These employees owed \u00a0$333,485 altogether.\n\n\nThe delinquencies are of concern to some in Congress. But guess what? The House of Representatives and Senate have their own share of people who are behind in their taxes. Their tax delinquency rates are even worse than the White House\u2019s.\n\n\nThe House, including a staff of 11,812 and 435 lawmakers, had 454 tax delinquents in 2011, owing nearly $8.9 million, giving it a 3.71 percent delinquency rate. That compared with the White House rate (the Executive Office of the President) of 2.10 percent.\n\n\nThe Senate, with 100 lawmakers and 6,930 staff members, had a rate of 3.33 percent, with 234 individuals owing the IRS $1.9 million. The IRS, alas, does not disclose the names of the deadbeats.\n\n"}

{"label": "true", "claim": "Elizabeth Warren \"The president of the United States already has the legal authority to reduce the price of many commonly used prescription drugs.\"", "evidence": "One theme Sen. Bernie Sanders has repeatedly touched on during his run for the Democratic nomination for president has been the high cost of prescription drugs.\nHis comment during the Feb. 11 Democratic debate at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee was typical as he rattled off a list of problems with the U.S. health care system: \"In America, we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.\"\nWe asked the Sanders campaign for the source of his claim. We didn't get a response. So we searched on our own.\nOne organization that tracks such things is the International Federation of Health Plans, based in London. Their latest price report, from 2013, lists eight common drugs. Compared with England, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and Canada, U.S. prices were far higher, sometimes dramatically so.\nConsider Nexium, the medicine widely used to treat acid reflux. A prescription that would cost $60 or less in other countries costs, on average, $215 in the United States. And that's just the average. Prices vary widely in this country: In 5 percent of the cases, the cost was $395.\n\"What Bernie says is true. There's nowhere that pays the same price as America,\" said Tom Sackville, the federation's CEO. In addition, \"there is this huge variation in price across America. Anything above the average is quite unjustified. When you get up to the 95th percentile, you're talking grand robbery.\"\nThe findings were similar in an April 2013 study published in the journal Health Affairs, which looked at the prices of brand name drugs in the United States, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany, France, Canada and Australia. In each of the three years studied -- 2005, 2007 and 2010 -- U.S. prices were consistently higher. The one exception: Switzerland.\nIn addition, researchers found that, between 2005 and 2010, \"the gap between the United States and other countries seemed to widen.\" And it wasn't just new drugs being embraced first in the United States that was driving up costs. They concluded that \"prices for older products rose faster in the United States than in other countries.\"\nBut Joel Farley of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Eshelman School of Pharmacy cautioned that the rule doesn't always apply to generic drugs. A 2008 comparison of 19 generic drugs found that some U.S. prices were lower than Canadian prices. \"In some cases it has to do with availability,\" he said. In other cases, a country may set the drug price low and in that fixed-price market \"there's no incentive to go lower.\"\nThe Wall Street Journal published an analysis in December that concluded 98 percent of 40 top branded drugs were more expensive in the United States than in England. In Norway, 93 percent of the 40 top branded drugs cost less\u00a0than in the United States. And in Ontario, a comparison of 30 drugs showed that U.S. prices were also higher for 93 percent of the products.\n\n"}

Obama minions are allowing Nestle Company to export precious fresh water out of Lake Michigan.\"", "evidence": "These days, President Barack Obama gets blamed for a lot of things -- the glitchy rollout of the healthcare.gov website, an unusually slow economic recovery, an out-of-control electronic surveillance network. But is he also at fault for selling off Lake Michigan\u2019s water to the highest bidder?\nSeveral readers recently asked us to check a claim they had seen circulating on social media. The most commonly shared versions seems to have originated on the conservative blog Coach is Right and the website of the Western Center for Journalism, whose president is longtime conservative activist Floyd Brown.\nThe post on the Western Center for Journalism\u2019s site is headlined, \"Barack Obama\u2019s war on America\u2019s fresh water supply.\" It reads:\n\"By using a little-known loophole in the 2006 Great Lakes Compact, Obama minions are allowing Nestle Company to export precious fresh water out of Lake Michigan to the tune of an estimated $500,000 to $1.8 million per day profit. By draining the precious jewel of the Great Lakes in the middle of America, our federal water managers are allowing the export of our water out of our country across thousands of miles of oceans into the Asian basin plagued by huge population centers that are suffering from their constant lack of fresh water.\"\nWe did not hear back from the Coach is Right site, but PolitiFact Ohio has previously looked at the question of water being removed from the Great Lakes and found that it was a genuine issue.\nIt stems from an agreement known as the Great Lakes Compact. It was negotiated by and has the force of law in eight states -- Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. (Two Canadian provinces are also involved in Great Lakes water policy decisions, but technically aren\u2019t part of the compact.)\nThe most important provision for this fact-check is its prohibition on diverting water from the Great Lakes basin -- with a key exception. That exception -- the \"loophole\" referred to in the blog post -- is that the compact permits the removal of water in containers of 5.7 gallons or less. The existence of this provision has enabled the bottled-water industry to construct major facilities in the Great Lakes basin, including one by Nestle Waters North America in Mecosta County, Mich.\nBecause the compact was designed to regulate and preserve the Great Lakes -- one of the world\u2019s great natural repositories of fresh water -- such commercial sales have been controversial. Peter Annin, author of The Great Lakes Water Wars, told PolitiFact Ohio that the provision was one of the most emotional issues during the compact\u2019s negotiation.\n\"Many people opposed the loophole during the negotiations, but each state included it anyway when they passed the legislation,\" said Melissa K. Scanlan, a professor at Vermont Law School who specializes in water law.\nLegislative fixes have been periodically floated in Congress, but none has yet advanced.\n\n"}

Charlie Crist cited a litany of accomplishments. Among them: Cover Florida, a state-backed health insurance plan designed to make coverage available to uninsured residents.\"This program is available to almost any Floridian, offering basic coverage for about $150 a month, instead of the typical $600 a month,\" he said. \"As with any private sector plan, the more extensive coverage you want, the higher the premiums, but with so many lacking basic preventive care, Cover Florida remains a sound option for thousands of Floridians.\"\nWhen we checked a similar claim from Crist in October, Crist said it usually costs $900 to get health insurance. That earned a False ruling because he was comparing apples and oranges. His claim is different this time, and so is the produce-aisle metaphor we're using to describe his technique: He's cherry-picking.First, some background. Launched in 2008, Cover Florida allows people without coverage for at least six months to pick from plans offered by six insurance companies. The state selected each provider through a competitive bidding process. The provider offers at least two options \u2014 one with catastrophic and hospital coverage, and another plan that can provide less coverage. The program's Web site says that the statewide individual plans can be purchased for as little as $23 a month, to as much as $500 a month, depending on age, gender and level of coverage. Patients pick and choose between various options offered through the insurers. So, for example, a woman who is between 19 and 29 years of age can pay $130 a month for a plan that includes no deductible, $10 copays for doctor visits, but no hospital inpatient coverage. Critics contend Cover Florida Health Care hasn't done enough to cover the uninsured. As of Dec. 31, 2009, about 5,400 people have enrolled \u2014 about 0.1 percent of the state's uninsured population, which Crist put at 3.8 million in his speech. But in his speech, Crist avoided those numbers and focused instead on the price. Let's examine both numbers he used.\nFirst, Crist avoided the apples and oranges mistake he made last time, in which he compared a number for family coverage with a number for individuals. But he stretched the truth in other ways.\nHe said basic coverage is available for about $150 a month. But we find that he's chosen a low number from the wide menu of options to give himself a favorable comparison.\n\n"}

So it caught our ear when Vincent A. \"Buddy\" Cianci Jr., the independent running for mayor of Providence, said during an interview on WHJJ-AM radio that one of his opponents, Democrat Jorge Elorza, wants to impose a municipal income tax.\nDuring the interview, host Ron St. Pierre asked Cianci, a former mayor of the city, a popular talk show host and twice-convicted felon, how he would try to get undecided voters to consider him. (St. Pierre previously worked with Cianci on his WPRO-AM talk-show.)\n\"Just run a good campaign and talk about the issues and talk about what the city of Providence can be and it should be a learning experience for the city,\" Cianci said.\nThen he added, \"My opponent, for instance, proposes a municipal income tax. . . . He wants to impose a municipal income tax. I think the last thing the City of Providence needs is another tax. It\u2019s going to be simple in this election.

{"label": "pants-fire", "claim": "Richard Tomlins \"Mayor Fung wants to punish our children's education by removing 12 million dollars from current funding to pay for his private charter school. Your taxes would increase by between 6 and 8 percent per year.\"", "evidence": "Last month, many residents of Cranston received an anonymous recorded call with a message delivered by an authoritative-sounding male voice warning:\n\n\"Parents, teachers, students and taxpayers. On Wednesday, Aug. 24, at 5 p.m. in front of the Cranston City Hall there will be a rally to save Cranston's award-winning school district. Mayor Fung wants to punish our children's education by removing $12 million from current funding to pay for his private charter school. Your taxes would increase by between 6 and 8 percent per year. This will be your last chance to deny the mayor from making our district second class. Be there.\"\n\nPulling $12 million out the Cranston school system sounded bad enough, but the prospect of a tax increase of 6 percent to 8 percent was even more frightening.\n\nBut we were skeptical because, in the first place, state law limits property tax increases (the limit is currently 4.25 percent) unless a city or town gets a special exception from the General Assembly.\n\nSo we decided to investigate.\n\nTHE BACKGROUND\n\nCharter schools are financed by local tax dollars but are free from many of the requirements that apply to traditional public schools. Supporters say such flexibility allows charters to have longer days and longer school years, and to experiment with alternative teaching methods. The students are usually chosen by lotteries and most schools are not unionized.\n\nCranston Mayor Allan Fung had proposed a public charter school, known as a mayoral academy, for Cranston and Providence. A similar school is operating for residents of Cumberland, Lincoln, Central Falls and Pawtucket.\n\nUnder Fung\u2019s proposal, the school would have been run by Achievement First, a nonprofit group that operates 19 similar charter schools in Connecticut and New York City. A board of directors headed by the mayor would have overseen the school.\n\nThe proposal was rejected by the Rhode Island Board of Regents for Elementary and Secondary Education on Sept. 1, 2011, after intervention by Gov. Lincoln Chafee, who recommended an alternative: studying the possibility of creating an Achievement First mayoral academy in Providence, drawing students from that city, Cranston, and other communities.\n\nIn his letter, Chafee urged the regents to take the opposition in Cranston -- and there was a lot of it -- seriously.\n\nOpponents say such schools are a threat to traditional public schools because they siphon away the most-promising students (those whose parents are involved enough to apply for the lottery) and drain the resources needed to make public schools better.\n\nThe robocall was reflecting that concern.\n\nThe calls were financed by Richard Tomlins, a Democrat who ran against Fung for mayor in 2010. He wrote the script for the calls.\n\nWe asked Tomlins why he referred to the academy as a \"private\" school when accountability would lie with the mayor, any Cranston child could apply for the lottery and parents wouldn't have to pay tuition.\n\nTomlins said it was because the nonprofit company that runs it, Achievement First, accepts corporate donations.\n\nHe said the $12-million figure came from multiplying the amount spent on teaching a child in Cranston (about $13,000 per pupil) by the number of pupils who would be leaving the system (950).\n\nHe said the robocall predicted an annual 6 percent to 8 percent tax increase because that's what it would take to raise the $12 million from property taxes.\n\nTHE ACTUAL NUMBERS\n\nTo check, we turned to an analysis by the Rhode Island Department of Education, which developed a list of the costs to Cranston of the proposed charter school.\n\nFirst we looked whether the mayoral academy, if approved, would draw $12 million from \"current funding.\"\n\nThe fact is, the project would not have removed a dime from the budget for the current fiscal year because the school would not have begun operations until a year from now.\n\nSo right off the bat, we were smelling lighter fluid.\n\nThen, we examined whether the $12 million would be true for subsequent years.\n\nAccording to the Rhode Island Department of Education, in the first year of operation, the school would have had 88 Cranston kindergartners, not 950 students as Tomlins had said. The state said the cost to the city that first year would have been $664,670, a price tag that would continue to grow as the school added more grades.\n\nBy the time those kindergartners had become fifth graders and the academy had evolved into a full-fledged elementary school in the fall of 2017, the annual loss to Cranston's school department was projected to be $6.2 million. At that point, it would have had 460 students, nearly half of what Tomlins said.\n\nThus, the amount of \"current funding\" being diverted to the academy this year, or six years from now, would not have come close to the $12 million mentioned in the robocall.\n\nTHE TAX QUESTION\n\nHow much would taxes go up if there had been a mayoral academy in Cranston?\n\nFor most PolitiFact items, we don't look at predictions. After all, things can change and predictions can only be fact-checked in retrospect.\n\nBut the debate over taxes offers some insight into one reason the academy was so controversial.\n\nFung\u2019s proposal came at a time when Cranston is getting a big infusion of state education money -- the amount goes up by an extra $2.3 million per year every year through 2018 -- thanks to the state's new financing formula that benefits some communities over others.\n\nThe bad news for the School Department: It doesn't necessarily get to keep that money; it follows the student wherever that student goes.\n\nThus, if pupils get diverted to a mayoral academy that the School Department doesn't control, the department loses revenue.\n\nFung said that should not have mattered. The School Department may lose some financing, but it would also be losing students and the costs associated with teaching them. The cumulative projected cost of Cranston's share of the academy over six years was $20.3 million. \u00a0Extra aid from the state financing formula over the same period will be $63.4 million.\n\n\"The funding formula is a per-pupil allocation and schools have to live within that,\" said Fung, whose Aug. 9 financial analysis of the proposal asserted that any fears that the mayoral academy \"would necessitate new tax dollars, or may add an additional tax burden on Cranston residents are unfounded.\"\n\nBut opponents of the academy said it's not so simple. Losing 4 percent of your students may immediately take away 4 percent of your revenue, but it doesn't automatically cut 4 percent of your costs.\n\nSteven Bloom, the unofficial budget expert on the School Committee and the man Tomlins himself suggested we consult, said that if the academy had been approved, it would have plunged the School Department's budget into the red by $20 million after five years and necessitated an annual tax increase of 2 percent to 3 percent per year.\n\n(One reason: The department is trying to pay the city back for the $6 million it overspent in the previous years. Bloom said that without the academy, the department should be in the black by the 2016-17 fiscal year, thanks in part to the extra state money.)\n\nROBOCALL DOES NOT COMPUTE\n\nBut we're checking the facts behind Tomlins' robocall, a call that may have galvanized some of the local opposition Chafee was talking about.\n\nIt is also a call that Bloom, an opponent of the mayoral academy, characterized as \"infuriating\" and misinformed.\n\nSo let's summarize.\n\nTomlins characterized the mayoral academy as Fung's \"private charter school,\" said it would have removed \"$12 million from current funding,\" and would have increased taxes \"between 6 and 8 percent per year.\"\n\nIt would not have been Fung's private school -- he would not have been able to take it with him when he left office. It would not have been a private school at all.\n\nIt would not have drained any money from the current school budget.\n\nIt would not have drained $12 million from the city in any annual budget projected through 2018.\n\nThe projected cumulative cost over six years would have been $20.3 million at a time when the city would be getting a $63.4 million infusion in additional state aid.\n\nEven if you bought Bloom's argument that the academy would ultimately have sent the School Department $20 million into the red, that still would have left Cranston with $23.1 million more in its coffers to help improve the city's public schools.\n\nAnd to threaten that the mayoral academy would have increased taxes by 6 percent to 8 percent each year when state law makes it difficult to impose such big tax hikes is ridiculous.\n\nThere were legitimate reasons to support or oppose Cranston's mayoral academy, but this robocall didn't correctly cite any of them.\n\nAnd because the false, inflammatory statements were made anonymously, we're going to do a little inflaming of our own. We rate Tomlin's ridiculous robocall Pants On Fire!\n\n(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)\n\n"}

Mitch McConnell sought to make Sotomayor's opinion look out of the mainstream by telling CNN that the Obama administration's Justice Department had disagreed. We find the truth is not so simple.\n\n\nFirst, a quick explanation of the case:\n\n\n\nRicci vs. DeStefano\n\ninvolves a group of mostly white firefighters who claimed reverse discrimination after the city threw out the results of promotional exams because white firefighters fared significantly better than black firefighters. If accepted, the test would have resulted in no black firefighters being eligible for promotion. The New Haven Civil Service Board said it was concerned the test may have violated \"anti-disparate-impact requirements\" of Title VII of the\u00a0 Civil Rights Act of 1964, and that the city would face an employment discrimination lawsuit from nonwhite applicants who were not promoted. So the board decided not to certify the exam results, and no one was promoted.\n\n\nEighteen firefighters \u2014 17 whites and one Hispanic \u2014 filed a lawsuit against the city claiming the decision not to certify the exam results \"amounted to intentional discrimination\" against the white firefighters in favor of black firefighters due to their race and political support for the mayor, John DeStefano.\n\n\nA federal district court judge who heard the case ruled in favor of the city, saying the city had the right to throw out the exams. The firefighters appealed to the 2nd Circuit, the court on which Sotomayor sits, and Sotomayor was part of a three-judge panel that upheld the district court decision.\n\n\nNow the case is being considered by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\nOn CNN's \"State of the Union\" program on May 31, 2009, McConnell, the Senate's Republican leader, was asked what troubled him most about the case.\n\n\nMcConnell said he had not yet read the case but \"the Department of Justice, under the Obama administration, disagrees with the decision\" Judge Sotomayor made.\n\n\n"}

Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., \"because we've done that, 17 times.\"\n\nLooking out for small businesses is a mainstay of political rhetoric these days. \"The small business community is sort of a favored group on which to shower tax breaks,\" said Joseph Rosenberg, research associate at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.\n\nBut have there been 17 tax cuts for small businesses by the Obama administration?\n\nAsked for backup, the DNC press office pointed us to a Feb. 25, 2011, posting on the official White House blog titled \"Seventeen Small Business Tax Cuts and Counting.\" The post enumerates 17 small business tax cuts and credits created or extended through legislation signed by President Barack Obama.\n\nEight of them were included in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (aka the economic stimulus), the Affordable Care Act (aka the health care law), and the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act (aka the Hire Act). Among the cuts: the exclusion of up to 75 percent of capital gains on key small business investments; a tax credit for the cost of health insurance for small business employees, and new tax credits for hiring Americans out of work for at least two months.\n\nAnother eight came via the Small Business Jobs Act, signed by President Obama in September of 2010. These included: adding deductions for business cell phone use; creating a new deduction for health care costs for the self-employed; allowing greater deductions for business start-up expenses; eliminating taxes on all capital gains from key small business investments, and raising the small business expense limit to $500,000. Three months later, the president signed a tax bill that raised the expense limit to 100 percent of small business new investments until the end of 2011. It also extended the elimination of capital gains taxes for small business investments through the end of 2012.\n\nHere's the full list:\n\nFrom the Recovery Act, HIRE Acts, and Affordable Care Act:\n\n1. A new small business health care tax credit\n\n2. A new tax credit for hiring unemployed workers\n\n3. Bonus depreciation tax incentives to support new investment\n\n4. 75 percent exclusion of small business capital gains\n\n5. Expansion of limits on small business expensing\n\n6. Five-year carryback of net operating losses\n\n7. Reduction of the built-in gains holding period for small businesses from 10 to 7 years to allow small business greater flexibility in their investments\u00a0 \u00a0\n8. Temporary small business estimated tax payment relief to allow small businesses to keep needed cash on hand\n\nFrom the Small Business Jobs Act:\n\n9. Zero capital gains taxes on key investments in small businesses\n\n10. Raising the small business expensing to $500,000\n\n11. An extension of 50 percent bonus depreciation\n\n12. A new deduction for health care expenses for the self-employed\n\n13. Tax relief and simplification for cell phone deductions\n\n14. An increase in the deduction for entrepreneurs\u2019 start-up expenses\n\n15. A five-year carryback of general business credits\n\n16. Limitations on penalties for errors in tax reporting that disproportionately affect small business\n\nAnd from the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act:\n\n17. 100 percent expensing\n\nTax experts at conservative think tanks like Heritage and Americans for Tax Reform don't quibble much with the list, but they do with the context. \"I can't argue with any of these, but it ignores all the proposed and enacted tax hikes on small business,\" said Ryan Ellis, director of tax policy at Americans For Tax Reform.\n\nFor example, he said, it ignores President Obama's proposal to allow Bush-era individual income tax cuts to expire for those making more than $250,000. \"A clear majority of small business profits are earned in households making at least $250,000 per year.\" Ellis said. \"...That's a tax hike on the small business sector.\"\n\nThere are also a number of tax increases included in the health care law, Ellis said, some of which apply directly to small businesses. For one, he said, businesses with more than 50 employees could face a tax penalty if they don't provide enough health insurance to their employees. Another example, the 10 percent tanning tax, which he said is \"nearly exclusively applied to small businesses.\"\n\n\"So the overall story is much more of a problem for small firms than the Obama administration would suggest,\" Ellis said.\n\nCurtis Dubay, senior tax policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, allowed that \"there have been targeted tax cuts for small businesses.\" But, he said, \"it's an error to just point to the number of tax cuts. You have to look at the overall impact and that certainly has been steep tax hikes.\"\n\nDubay also noted that six of the 17 cuts were not just for small businesses but were made widely available to all businesses.\n\nRichard Morrison at the Tax Foundation, a pro-business group, said that \"nothing on (the White House list) stands out as egregiously unjustified from a fact-checking perspective. Some of them are temporary, and some aren\u2019t targeted exclusively at small businesses, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they shouldn\u2019t 'count' as far as Rep. Wasserman Schultz\u2019s claim is concerned.\"\n\nWe think there's room for critics to note that in addition to the 17 tax cuts enumerated by the White House, there are there are also some tax increases in the health care law that will fall on some of the same small business owners that got tax cuts. Some health care law tax increases won't go into effect for a couple years. And with some, like the excise taxes on tanning beds, one could argue it is a tax on the customer, not the small business. As for allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire, that might certainly affect a number of small business owners. But that's still just an Obama proposal. It hasn't happened. The only policy actually signed by the president so far was a compromise agreement that extended the tax cuts through 2012"}

Is he right about climate change and fewer days on ice-covered lakes?\nWhen we asked Pocan for backup for the claim, his staff pointed us to Climatewisconsin.org, a web site that highlights research and reports prepared by environmental groups.\nThe site includes interactive features that focus on the two largest lakes in Madison -- Mendota and Monona. It includes the amount of time they have been covered by ice in past years.\n\"The records show significant year-to-year variability in the length of the ice-cover season, but there is a clear trend of fewer ice-cover days over time,\" the site says.\n\"Overall, the average number of days of ice cover on the Madison lakes has decreased by around 29-35 days over the past 150 years.

In fact, with the aid of a remarkable dataset from Madison\u2019s lakes, scientists infer that a change in ice duration has already taken place.\"\nInformation posted on the site comes, at least in part, from the work of John J.

Researchers note the day lakes freeze and the day the ice goes out.\nIt\u2019s a more official version of what is waged in a less academic way by lakefront bars that stage ice-out guessing contests.\nMadison researchers have records for Mendota and Monona that go back to 1855.\n\n"}

Allen West went for what was supposed to be a fun excursion for the Army vet: A patriotic dive off the coast in Broward County.\n\nLittle did West know he was entering hot water.\n\nThe Miami Herald reported on West's June 12, 2011 dive with a group of Army, Navy and Marine Corps veterans and published a photo of West underwater in scuba gear, saluting the American flag. \"I think it's important wherever we are, that the flag flies,\" West, a 22-year veteran Army officer and experienced scuba diver, told the Herald. The veterans who joined him agreed.\n\nBut was the whole thing illegal?\n\nThat's a claim being circulated by bloggers.\n\nThe Daily Pulp, a blog of the Broward-Palm Beach New Times, reported on West's deep sea adventure June 14 with the headline: \"Allen West violates federal law during weekend diving trip.\"\n\n\"There's nothing really bad to say about Rep. Allen West going diving off the coast of Deerfield Beach with a bunch of military veterans -- except for the fact that he violated U.S. federal law in the process and provided a pictorial of himself doing so,\" the blog claimed. \"During his diving session Sunday, Lt. Col. West was photographed holding an American flag underwater, on top of an artificial reef -- which would be a violation of the United States Code.\"\n\nThe blog then quoted Title 4, Chapter 1, Section 8, Subsection B of the U.S. Code: \"The flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or merchandise.\"\n\nThe allegation against West -- a freshman legislator being targeted by Democrats in 2012 -- was picked up or repeated by dozens of websites, including POLITICO, and BlogPost, a Washington Post blog. The Salon.com headline was \"Why does Allen West hate the American flag?\"\n\nPolitiFact Florida wanted to see if the blogger's claim had merit.\n\nThere is indeed a \"Respect for Flag\" section of the U.S. code. It reads: \"No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United States of America; the flag should not be dipped to any person or thing. Regimental colors, State flags, and organization or institutional flags are to be dipped as a mark of honor.\"\n\nThe code contains several rules about how to respect the flag including that it should \"never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free ... never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery\" and \"never be used as a covering for a ceiling.\"\n\nFor this fact-check, we're focusing on the part that pertains to West, that \"the flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or merchandise.\"\n\nWe contacted five different experts -- two former federal prosecutors and three law professors who teach constitutional law. All agreed the flag code is intended to advise people on how to respect the flag and that there is no penalty for violating the code. Most said, generally, that West's actions did not violate law.\n\n\u2022 The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the right to burn the flag. So, experts asked, how could diving underwater with a flag be possibly considered worse? West's display of the flag underwater would be protected by his First Amendment rights, which would trump the code, said Kendall Coffey, a former federal prosecutor who worked for Democrats in the Bush v. Gore 2000 recount case.\n\n\"It's really just a guidance rather than an instrument of prosecution,\" Coffey said. \"He's acting inconsistent with the law, but if your actions are in effect protected by the Constitution which overrides laws you would not say he is violating the law. ... I don't think he has violated the law. I think he is fully protected by the U.S. Constitution.\"\n\n\u2022 The flag code uses the word \"should,\" as opposed to \"shall.\" That suggest the code isn't legally binding, said Michael Froomkin, a law professor at the University of Miami.\n\n\"It's pretty clear to me that this rule is advisory, or normative, but, not mandatory unless referenced somewhere else in the code. (I'm aware of no such references.),\" Froomkin wrote in an e-mail. \"While one might expect a congressperson to choose to obey these rules voluntarily, that is an issue of decorum, not law. So, yes, it is a violation of something in the U.S. Code, but no, not a violation of a law that you can actually get arrested or fined for violating.\"\n\nBob Jarvis, a law professor at Nova Southeastern University, agreed. \"There is no punishment here,\" Jarvis said. \"When we talk about law where there is no enforcement mechanism it's an advisory law. Then the question becomes is that really a law?\"\n\n\u2022 No prosecutor would ever try the case. Coffey and former South Florida federal prosecutor Jeffrey Sloman said prosecution was extremely unlikely. \"It is my opinion that no U.S. Attorney (in his right mind) would ever prosecute anyone, let alone a U.S. Congressman, for the conduct you have described,\" Sloman wrote in an e-mail.\n\nWe asked for a response from West's spokeswoman Angela Sachitano. She e-mailed us back a June 15, 2011 blog item in the conservative Weekly Standard, which wrote \"it turns out that U.S. Armed Forces routinely takes the flag underwater for reenlistment ceremonies and various other reasons. Nevermind that it was obvious West was honoring the flag, and he's a retired lieutenant colonel and combat veteran that's probably far more sensitive to what is and is not appropriate to do with the flag than a flurry of liberal bloggers.\" Sachitano also sent us a link from the Navy's website showing a photo of a member of the Navy underwater holding the U.S. flag.\n\nSo is the Navy breaking the law?\n\n"}

Our economy could fall $1 trillion short of its full capacity, which translates into more than $12,000 in lost income for a family of four.\"\nWe've heard lots of big numbers about the recession, but we were especially interested in whether a family of four would lose $12,000 in income.\nLet's start with the $1 trillion number. For numbers on the economy, we turned to the Congressional Budget Office, the federal agency charged with providing objective, nonpartisan analysis to Congress.\nIts most recent report, issued on Jan. 8, 2009, found that economic output could fall 6.8 percent below its potential. For the roughly $14.2 trillion economy projected for 2009, an unrealized potential of 6.8 percent does come out to about $1 trillion.\nNow how does that translate for a family of four? As near as we can tell, Obama took the $1 trillion and divided by 300 million \u2014 the number of people who live in the United States. That comes to $3,333 per person. Multiply it by four and you get $13,333, or a conservative $12,000. Now, we can't say for sure that's how Obama arrived at his number for wages. We asked the press office about it and didn't hear back. (In their defense, they have reportedly been having  e-mail trouble  .) It's certainly possible Obama used a more sophisticated analysis to determine unrealized wages.\nBut the economists we talked to said no matter how Obama determined the number for a family of four, any average oversimplifies how economic downturns affect the public. Some family members, for example, will see no drop in their wages, or might even get new jobs that increase their income. For other families, it will be much, much worse.\n\n"}

That\u2019s an approximately 57 percent drop.\nHowever, despite the fact that the sanctions remain in place, the ruble has steadily creeped up over the past year, reaching a value of 1.7 cents per ruble as of Feb. 21, 2017. That\u2019s about 40 percent less than the value before the sanctions went into effect.\nRussia\u2019s GDP has also fallen over the past couple years. Tata specifically mentioned 2014-16. Russia\u2019s GDP was \u00a0$2.053 trillion (in U.S. dollars) in 2014, according to the World Bank, dropping to $1.331 trillion in 2015 \u2014 a drop of about 35 percent.\nAdjusted for inflation, however, the drop was more like 3.7 percent because of the struggling ruble.\nRussia\u2019s 2016 GDP is not yet available, but the Russian government has reported very little change from 2015.\nEffect of the sanctions\nThe U.S. sanctions against Russia targeted specific individuals, firms and sectors close to Putin. For example, they froze U.S.-held assets that belong to some major Russian companies and banks.\n\n"}

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Jason Isaac Says state Rep. Patrick Rose votes 90 percent with liberals, backed the state's largest tax increase, proposed nearly $15 billion in government spending and supported \"Obama-style government-run health care system for Texas.\"", "evidence": "Playing on his foe's name, Republican Texas House nominee Jason Isaac calls fourth-term Democratic Rep. Patrick Rose a \"liberal thorn in our side.\"\n\nIn a video ad that debuted online Oct. 7, Isaac lists pointed reasons to yank Rose, who's in his fourth term. Rose, the narrator says, \"votes with the liberals 90 percent of the time, ...backed the largest tax increase in Texas history... (and) proposed nearly $15 billion in new government spending.\" The narrator adds: \"Rose even supported an Obama-style government-run health care system for Texas.\"\n\nThe Truth-O-Meter analyzed the biggest-tax-increase charge earlier this year when U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison laid it on Gov. Rick Perry. We rated False Hutchison's statement that the state's revamped business tax amounted to the largest tax increase Texas has ever had. In checking Hutchison's statement, we noted that her campaign said the revised franchise tax, often called the margins tax, cost taxpayers $8.8 billion in 2008-09. Her camp compared that figure with the estimated $5.7 billion tax package signed into law in 1987 by Gov. Bill Clements. At the time, that increase was widely reported to be the largest tax hike in Texas history.\n\nThere were fatal flaws in Hutchison's math. For instance, the $8.8 billion figure is the total amount generated by the franchise tax, not the net increase resulting from the revision that became law under Perry. The actual increase \u2014 revenue above what the old franchise tax would have brought in \u2014 was about $3 billion, significantly less than what had been projected.\n\nWe compared that with the largest single piece of the Clements-era tax package: a hike in the sales tax. After it was enacted, sales tax revenues went up $4.2 billion during 1988-89 compared with the previous biennium.\n\nIsaac's campaign consultant, Corbin Casteel, cited the same 2006 tax law, House Bill 3, as the basis for Isaac's \"largest ever\" claim. Casteel also referred us to the same source referenced by Hutchison, a Dallas Morning News blog post that doesn't that doesn't specify how the paper compared 2006 changes in business and tobacco taxes to past tax hikes. Meantime, two experts we contacted--Dale Craymer of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association and Talmadge Heflin of the conservative-leaning Texas Public Policy Foundation--independently told us the 2006 tax changes did not amount to Texas history's largest increase.\n\nBut what of Isaac's other not-rosy claims?\n\nCasteel said the reference to Rose voting with \"the liberals\" 90 percent of the time was backed up by an analysis of House votes by Mark P. Jones, who chairs Rice University's political science department.\n\nCasteel guided us to a Texas Tribune chart based on Jones' work showing that Rose is the 68th most liberal of the House's 150 members and the 7th-most conservative Democrat.\n\nWe didn't find an indication Rose had mostly voted with liberals, so we called Jones, who said that there's nothing in his research, based on Rose's votes throughout his House career, to justify the 90-percent statement. While Rose \"votes in a more liberal manner than any Republican in the House,\" Jones said, \"he will be one of the five most conservative Democrats if he comes back.\"\n\nWe alerted Casteel to Jones' interpretation; he then shared another way of breaking down Rose's voting record -- based solely on 561 Rose votes during the 2009 legislative session. A research sheet prepared for Isaac's campaign says the selected votes don't include opening-bell procedural votes or votes when no one voted \"no.\" It doesn't specify each vote.\n\nThe sheet says Rose voted with 11 Democratic colleagues identified as \"most liberal\" on the Tribune chart 87 to 92 percent of the time, voting 90 percent or more often with six colleagues in the \"most liberal\" category: Reps. David Leibowitz of San Antonio, Eddie Rodriguez of Austin, Jim Dunnam of Waco and Alma Allen, Garnet Coleman and Ana Hernandez of Houston. In contrast, Isaac's sheet says, Rose voted like the former Republican House speaker, Rep. Tom Craddick of Midland, 65 percent of the time.\n\nBack to the professor... Jones said via e-mail that Isaac's camp correctly identified the \"most liberal\" members using his research. But he said they used a less sophisticated approach by including votes not necessarily reflective of ideology.\n\nCasteel said Isaac's statement about Rose proposing nearly $15 billion in spending is based on the projected costs of proposals authored by Rose in the 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009 legislative sessions; spreadsheets Casteel provided to us indicate that Rose offered 96 measures over those years that together would have cost the state nearly $14.4 billion through six years.\n\nBut did they? We asked which of the Rose proposals passed into law. Casteel countered that Isaac was talking about what Rose wanted to spend--not what he passed into law.\n\nWhy six years, since legislators typically only focus on two years of spending at a time? (That's the length of the budget adopted every odd-numbered year.) Casteel said Isaac's statement relies on the six-year spending forecasts because that's what Rose's ideas would have cost taxpayers over the longer term.\n\nCasteel said Isaac's statement that Rose \"supported an Obama-style government-run health care system for Texas\" refers to a May 21, 2007 floor vote. Online legislative records show that Rose was among 51 members to vote against tabling a proposal by Rep. Lon Burnam, D-Fort Worth, directing the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to prepare a report \"detailing the means by which this state could insure the maximum number of people and eventually implement a system of universal health care.\" The motion to table prevailed, killing Burnam's amendment.\n\nAll in all, does Isaac's prickly statement draw blood?\n\nIsaac's largest-tax-increase claim is incorrect. And while Isaac's method of counting votes indicates that Rose votes 90 percent of the time with House liberals, it's based on research conducted by a university professor who says Isaac's message -- that Rose's ideology swings liberal -- isn't justified by Rose's career voting record.\n\nPer Isaac's spending charge, the tally of what Rose's proposals would have cost is closer to $14 billion than the nearly $15 billion Isaac proclaims. Also, adding up projected costs over six years--rather than the two years covered by each budget--isn't how lawmakers usually weigh fiscal implications.\n\nIsaac's statement that Rose \"supported an Obama-style government-run health care system for Texas,\" reflects Rose's vote against ending debate on a proposal calling for a report on how the state could implement a \"universal health care\" system. Ordering a feasibility report on universal health care--in action, ahem, more than a\u00a0 year before Obama won election as president--is not the same as endorsing a particular system"}

This committee was set up, as they have admitted, for the purpose of making a partisan political issue out of the deaths of four Americans.\"\nIs Clinton correct that there have been seven and now eight investigations into Benghazi? We started counting and found she was largely accurate.\nHere\u2019s what we found.\nBackground\nClinton was secretary of state when Islamic extremists attacked a U.S. diplomatic mission and a CIA compound in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012. U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans died in the barrage.\nIn the weeks following the attack, the White House was heavily questioned for its response to the terrorist attack. Many debated, among conflicting reports from intelligence officials, what role al-Qaeda played in the attack and how much the White House knew about the group\u2019s involvement. Critics also questioned whether Clinton and the State Department could have better addressed security at the U.S. facilities before they were attacked. The debate got more partisan as time went on, as Republicans began speaking of conspiracy theories and cover-ups.\nThe seven probes mentioned by Clinton include only those conducted by Congress, but there was at least one more. After the attack, Clinton convened an Accountability Review Board to investigate the incident -- something she was legally required to do. The Board\u2019s report found no fault in the State Department for the terrorist attacks but acknowledged \"systematic failures and leadership and management deficiencies\" that left Benghazi vulnerable. Four State Department officials were temporarily suspended and ultimately reassigned within the department.\nIt should be noted that each congressional committee that investigated the Benghazi attack looked into different aspects of the event. After the attack, Republican Speaker John Boehner directed the House Committees on Oversight and Government Reform, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, Armed Services and Intelligence to investigate the issues within their jurisdictions. The House investigations were led by Republicans. Two bipartisan Senate Committees also investigated the attack.\nClinton said the committees found that she and her department had not committed wrongdoing but suggested changes. Actually, almost every committee report found her department did not adequately address security concerns in Libya or could have done more to prevent the attack. Clinton\u2019s words give the best possible spin to the various committee findings, but she\u2019s also essentially accurate.\nHere\u2019s a list of all the congressional investigations and what they found.\nInvestigation 1: The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform\nThe House Oversight Committee was one of the first committees to question Clinton following the Benghazi attack. On Sept. 16, 2013, the Republican-led committee released an interim report on the Accountability Review Board appointed by Clinton.

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Paul Ryan \"We've got about $3 trillion in trapped cash overseas that basically can't come back in this country because of our tax laws.\"", "evidence": "When U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan met with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel staff on Sept. 1, 2017, an editor mentioned major tax cuts adopted under Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1981.\nAt first, Ryan joked around.\n\"The music was bad in those days, and the tax laws were as well,\" he replied, chuckling. \"So, I think -- I\u2019m not a big \u201880s music guy; I\u2019m more of a \u201870s guy.\"\nBut the 47-year-old Janesville Republican quickly got serious. Arguing that U.S. taxes are stopping U.S.-based multinational corporations from bringing giant sums of money to America, he stated:\nWe've got about $3 trillion in trapped cash overseas that basically can't come back in this country because of our tax laws.\nRyan has made essentially the same claim a number of times, including on Milwaukee television, on CNBC, on Twitter and to the New York Times. \u00a0\nSo, do U.S. tax laws essentially prevent $3 trillion being held overseas from being brought to this country?\nKeep the word repatriate in mind.\nTaxing foreign earnings\nThe object of Ryan\u2019s criticism is the U.S. corporate tax rate. At 35 percent, as we reported in a Donald Trump fact check during the 2016 presidential campaign, it is among the highest in the world -- though it\u2019s worth noting that, after deductions, companies typically pay an \"effective\" rate that can be much lower.\n(Trump, by the way, pledged during the presidential campaign to reduce the rate to 15 percent. That promise has been rated as In the Works on PolitiFact National\u2019s Trump-O-Meter.)\nAs for the focus of Ryan\u2019s claim, he\u2019s talking about U.S.-based multinational corporations. More specifically, the foreign-earned profits of those companies. Here\u2019s an example of how the taxation works:\nIf the company earns income in a country with a 20 percent corporate tax rate, it would pay that 20 percent tax immediately to that country. If that money is then repatriated -- that is, brought back to the company\u2019s U.S. headquarters -- the company would pay an additional 15 percent to the U.S. government. (In other words, the U.S. tax rate of 35 percent minus the 20 percent already paid to the foreign country.)\nSo, as long as the profits stay parked overseas, there is no U.S. tax on it.\nNow to the specifics of Ryan\u2019s claim.\nThe $3 trillion figure\nTo back up Ryan\u2019s statement, his office cited an April 2017 CNBC news article that said American companies are holding about $2.6 trillion in overseas earnings, and the figure has been growing.\nThat\u2019s the latest estimate by Congress\u2019 nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, for 2015, although an estimate done in July 2017 for PolitiFact National put the figure at $2.8 trillion.\nSo, Ryan\u2019s claim of about $3 trillion is reasonable.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the figure has been rising. In fact, considering only the Russell 1000 index of large companies, the amount of parked cash overseas has more than doubled since 2008, as shown in a July 2017 report by the Massachusetts research firm Audit Analytics:\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\n\nAmount of foreign-earned profits by U.S.-based companies kept overseas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2008\n\n\n$1.09 trillion\n\n\n\n\n2009\n\n\n$1.19 trillion\n\n"}

We\u2019ve got 60 people that we fired who have manipulated wait times.\"", "evidence": "When Robert McDonald took over as secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs in July 2014, the department was mired in a scandal over veterans\u2019 health care, involving a whistleblower\u2019s claims that VA employees had manipulated wait-time data. The controversy led to the ouster of McDonald\u2019s predecessor, Eric Shinseki.\nSo what has McDonald done to clean up the embattled department since he arrived? He offered some details during a Feb. 15 appearance on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press.\n\"We're making fundamental changes in the department in terms of leadership. We have held accountable about 900 employees who are no longer with us that were with us before I became secretary,\" McDonald said.\nHost Chuck Todd asked McDonald what he meant by \"held accountable.\"\n\"Nine hundred people have been fired since I became secretary,\" he said. \"We've got 60 people that we fired who have manipulated wait times.\"\nThat seems to be a pretty big house-cleaning. Did that many people really get fired? We decided to see whether 900 people were let go and whether 60 of them were ousted directly because of the scandal.\n\"Nine hundred people have been fired since I became secretary\"\nJames Hutton, a VA spokesman, told PolitiFact that \"personnel from a wide range of locations, across the spectrum of pay grades, have been removed. Some of the reasons include poor performance, absenteeism, among several others.\"\nHutton provided a breakdown of the firings. There were 468 \"removals\" of regular employees. Most of these \u2014 432 \u2014 were employees of the Veterans Health Administration, while 27 worked for the Veteran Benefits Administration and the rest worked in other, smaller offices.\nTo get to 900, McDonald is also counting 487 \"probationary\" terminations. When most people go to work for the federal government, they first go through a one-year probationary period \u2014 a tryout, if you like. During that probationary period, it is much easier to let go of an employee who isn\u2019t working out. After that, the rules covering firing are tilted more favorably toward the employee.\nThis means that more than half of the firings under McDonald were terminations of probationary employees working at the department for less than one year. That\u2019s important for a few reasons.\nMost importantly, this means that about half of the people let go under McDonald\u2019s watch were employees who were just starting work as the scandal had come to light, or weren\u2019t even there when it was going on.\nAlso, this makes it unlikely that all 900 terminated employees \"were with us before I became secretary,\" as McDonald put it in the interview. For that to be true, it would mean that not a single probationary hire under McDonald has been let go since he came on in July. Is it possible that Veterans Affairs, which has the second-largest federal workforce, did not fire a single probationary employee in the last seven months?

It flared up on the eve of the election, and has raged since Republican Scott Walker was elected Nov. 2, 2010.\n\nWalker wants the project stopped, even if it means rejecting $810 million in already-approved federal money. After state officials signed contracts in a pre-election push to ensure the project moves forward, outgoing Gov. Jim Doyle has backed off -- but argues ending the project will cost taxpayers $100 million.\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, who lost to Walker, has said the city\u00a0 will consider legal options if the train is killed.\n\nVirtually everyone has entered the fight, often wielding statistics to argue their point. That includes the Sierra Club\u2019s Wisconsin chapter.\n\nWeapon of choice: Jobs.\n\nIn a news release and a petition, the Sierra Club argues if the state turns down money for high speed rail, it will \"kill nearly 10,000 permanent Wisconsin jobs.\"\n\nIf PolitiFact had sound effects, we\u2019d add a loud whistle here.\n\nAs in, that\u2019s a lot of jobs.\n\nAnd as in, let\u2019s have a timeout and get to the bottom of this.\n\nMany different job-related statistics have been bandied about in the debate.\n\nThe state Department of Transportation estimates there are the 13,719 jobs involved in construction, engineering, design and train manufacturing tied to the project.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Walker argued the project would create only 55 permanent jobs, declaring in an open letter to President Barack Obama on his notrain.com web site: \"That\u2019s $14.5 million per job, not including any hidden costs!\"\n\nThere, Walker is talking about jobs on the train line itself -- conductors, engineers, ticket-takers and the like. In making the claim, he is purposely choosing the smallest possible number to make his point.\n\nBut what of the nearly 10,000 permanent jobs claimed by the Sierra Club and others, some of whom are now citing the Sierra Club as the source of the number? These are jobs not tied directly to the project and as such are hardest to measure hardest to quantify.\n\nYet the group offers a very specific number: 9,572.\n\nThe number comes from a 2006 economicanalysis prepared for Amtrak and nine states, including Wisconsin, a group called the Midwest Regional Rail Initiative. The study, prepared by Transportation & Economics Management Systems, became part of the state\u2019s application for the train funding.\n\nThe study says: \"The development of the system integrates so many communities, and provides such a wide reaching impact that it will generate on its own a 0.1 percent growth to the region\u2019s economy.\"\n\nThe sweeping conclusion:\n\n\"It will support existing manufacturing and service industries and will foster the growth of new small businesses across the Midwest because of the improved access between communities. It will encourage large businesses to distribute their operations more widely across the Midwest and reap the benefit of providing more efficient \u2018back shop\u2019 operations in the highly accessible smaller communities.\"\n\nOK, but how do you quantify all that?\n\nIf you dig into the study, you find it is based on numerous assumptions and applies multipliers and other formulas to come up with a bottom line: Expanded train service would create 58,000 jobs in the nine states, boost property values by $5 billion and increase urban household income by $1 billion.\n\nLet\u2019s look at some of the factors and underlying assumptions, with an eye toward how the Sierra Club and others are using them when they claim 10,000 permanent jobs are at stake with the Milwaukee to Madison line.\n\nSize of the system\n\nThe numbers are based on the prospect of a fully-built system throughout the Midwest. That is, it\u2019s not just high-speed rail from Milwaukee to Madison, but Chicago all the way to Minneapolis. And Chicago to St. Louis. And ultimately connections to Omaha, Kansas City, Indianapolis, Detroit, Cleveland and more.\n\nIt even includes a spur to Green Bay, with proposed stations in Menomonee Falls, Fond du Lac, Neenah and Appleton. That piece alone accounts for 3,200 jobs in the study, some of which overlap with the Milwaukee jobs.\n\nBut the federal funds allocated so far only cover some pieces of the plan.\n\nAnd there is no certainty the full system will ever be built -- in Ohio, Governor-elect John Kasich has vowed to block the Cleveland to Cincinnati to Columbus piece.\n\nSo, even if Walker were to have a change of heart, the system may be smaller and have fewer connections, which could mean its jobs impact is smaller as well.\n\nJobs gained, jobs lost\n\nThe study suggests that new jobs and opportunities will develop around the new route, as more people take advantage of the high-speed connections. However, as people board the train they are taken off the highways and don\u2019t as often take to the skies.\n\nBut the study counts only the new jobs, not any lost ones.\n\n\"How many airline pilots or contractors renovating terminals will not be needed?\" \u00a0said Steven E. Polzin, of the Center for Urban Transportation Research at the University of South Florida, an expert on rail proposals, whose group has been criticized for favoring cars and roads. \u00a0\"How many auto workers, gas station attendants, road contractors, etc.\"\n\nSo, part of the equation is missing.\n\nStations as economic hubs\n\nThe study assumes that stations will become economic hubs, prompting other businesses to create jobs nearby. But the stations envisioned are no sure thing.\n\nFor instance, the initial Madison station was to be near the airport -- not ideal for someone headed to the Capitol. Now it\u2019ll be in the city center, but going into the city slows down a traveler from Milwaukee to Minneapolis. \u00a0\n\nLeaders of some cities, including Brookfield and Wauwatosa, have said they don\u2019t even want a proposed station.\n\nSo, more uncertainty.\n\nOther travel options\n\nIf the price of gas remains relatively low, there will be less incentive for travelers to get out of their cars and board the train. Indeed, cars may be able to make the trip faster -- assuming there\u2019s no traffic congestion. Initial train speeds are planned to be 79 miles an hour, not including stops; the train would run at higher speeds later.\n\nWhats more, Mitchell International Airport is enjoying an air carrier -- and airfare -- war, which has helped it attract more passengers than ever. There is no telling how long that will last, but low air fares could have an impact on who grabs the train.\n\nPolzin, who reviewed the study at the request of PolitiFact Wisconsin, said it appeared to be professionally done, using methods that are generally accepted.\n\nHe noted that such studies are usually done to build support for a project \"and look exclusively at the benefits of the specific option, not the comparative benefits of other options or directing those resources to others purposes.\"\n\nIndeed, the state Department of Transportation has not highlighted the 10,000 permanent jobs figure, focusing instead on construction-related jobs for the Milwaukee-to-Madison line.\n\n\"That\u2019s work that we did ourselves,\" said Cari Anne Renlund, executive assistant for the state DOT. \"We need to talk about what we know is real.\"\n\nWe\u2019ll leave Projection Land and return to reality as well.\n\nThe Sierra Club\u2019s Wisconsin chapter and others say killing the high-speed train will kill jobs, specifically 9,572 permanent ones. Their number is taken from a professional analysis, but that analysis is based on a host of assumptions -- including that an entire Midwest network is built -- many of which could change. And while the Sierra Club suggests the jobs are an immediate loss, the report itself puts them years into the future.\n\nThe Truth-O-Meter isn\u2019t a crystal ball"}
{"label": "pants-fire", "claim": "Jon Husted Says that while his plan would narrow the time for early voting, \"it still will be one of the most aggressive early voting time frames in America.\"", "evidence": "Secretary of State Jon Husted says he\u2019s on a quest to balance \"access and accuracy\" when it comes to a package of election reforms he is hoping to get Ohio lawmakers to enact.\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t stopped critics of the Republican\u2019s plan from pointing out that Husted\u2019s proposal to change Ohio\u2019s election laws would narrow the time during which voters can cast ballots through in-person early voting as well as reduce the days in which to request absentee ballots.\n\nUnder Husted\u2019s proposal, the voting window would allow 21 days to request absentee ballots and 16 days for in-person early voting -- down from 33 days for absentee voting and 35 days for in-person voting under Ohio\u2019s current voting law.\n\nHoping to blunt criticism, including the notion that his plan goes too far in restricting access to voters, Husted appeared April 7 at an event held by the Ohio League of Women Voters. During his remarks, Husted touched on the issue of the shrinking window for early voting and absentee ballot requests contained in his plan.\n\nHusted said under his plan \"it still will be one of the most aggressive early voting time frames in America,\" according to a report from Gongwer News Service, a Statehouse-based paid information service.\n\nGiven the criticism of Husted\u2019s plan, Politifact Ohio decided to check into Husted\u2019s statement.\n\nThere are two forms of early voting in Ohio: in-person early voting and absentee ballot voting.\n\nFor information on in-person early voting and absentee voting across all 50 states, we turned to the National Association of Secretary of States.\n\nOnly 33 states plus the District of Columbia offer in-person early voting. Further research revealed that two of those states \u2014 Georgia and North Dakota \u2014 only do so on a county-by-county basis so we threw those two states out for the purposes of this analysis.\n\nAmong the 31 remaining states (and the District of Columbia), Ohio ranks either sixth or seventh for time available to vote in-person, depending on how you rank Wisconsin\u2019s 30-day period compared to Ohio\u2019s.\n\nThat\u2019s because while Ohio\u2019s early voting window is 35 days long, it excludes certain weekend days so really there are only between 27 and 31 days when early voting can actually occur. And, it can vary from county to county, depending on their policies concerning weekend hours.\n\nHamilton County, for example, was open for in-person early voting all five Saturdays in October 2010 while Pike County allowed it only on the last Saturday in October thus the range of four days across Ohio counties.\n\nHusted\u2019s proposal would open up a 16-day in person voting window, however, his proposal has specific guidelines for all counties to follow regarding weekend hours. His plan would allow in-person voting locations be open only one Saturday. They would be closed on all Sundays and in-person voting would halt the Friday before Election Day. That means there would be 11 possible days for early voting under Husted\u2019s plan.\n\nUnder Husted\u2019s proposal, Ohio would drop to have the 21st biggest window for in-person voting among the 31 early voting states plus the District of Columbia, according to the NASS data. Put another way, only 11 states that allow early voting statewide would have shorter periods than Ohio to vote early in-person.\n\nHusted\u2019s communications director, Maggie Ostrowski, said that Ohio\u2019s top elections officer was trying to make the point that even with a condensed window Ohio \"will provide more opportunities than many other states.\"\n\nIn large part that\u2019s because Ohio has a \"no-fault\" law \u2014 a provision in Ohio law which allows voters to request an absentee ballot without having to cite any reason. States with longer windows may have fewer voters able to take advantage of it if they don\u2019t have a \"no-fault\" policy in place, she said.\n\n\"Longer time frame is one way to look at it, but we have more opportunities for more people,\" Ostrowski said. \"They may have longer windows, but you have to have an excuse to vote. They aren\u2019t no-fault. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to compare Ohio to states that don\u2019t have no-fault voting.\"\n\nWhile it may be a fair point about comparing no-fault voting states with those without easy access to absentee ballots, we return to Husted\u2019s words which were that Ohio would still have \"one of the most aggressive early voting time frames in America.\"\n\nHis statement doesn\u2019t offer any qualifier about no-fault voting, and uses the phrase \"time frame\" which clearly means span of days.\n\nOstrowski also noted that many states are changing their early voting period, and said it\u2019s not a totally fair to compare what Ohio would look like in the future to what other states look like today. We checked with the National Conference of State Legislators (NCSL) and there are 16 states actively considering adding or changing their in-person early voting periods, according to a legislation tracker on the NCSL website. And some state legislatures have as many as 10 competing bills pending, making it impossible to determine where Ohio would stack up relative to other states in the future.\n\nSo while it\u2019s possible that Ohio could move a great deal up or down the scale depending on what happens in more than a dozen other states regarding in-person early voting, Husted\u2019s remarks on April 7 weren\u2019t made in the context of what could possibly happen in other states in the future and where Ohio could rank in the future.\n\nNext we looked at how the time frame for Ohio\u2019s absentee voting would stack up against other states if his plan became law.\n\nBecause NASS doesn\u2019t track when the absentee ballot request window begins in all 50 states, we turned to information collected by a non-partisan academic research center at Reed College known as the Early Voting Information Center. \u00a0\n\nThree states -- Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Utah are toss outs, as as they appear to have no starting points in their windows for requesting absentee ballots.\n\nOf the remaining 47 states and the District of Columbia, Ohio\u2019s current absentee ballot window of 33 days would rank roughly in the middle, \u00a026th among the eligible states, according to the Early Voting Information Center.\n\nIf Husted\u2019s plan were adopted, the absentee ballot request window would shrink to 21 days, which would make Ohio 39th among the eligible states. That means there would be only be eight states with a shorter time frame for absentee ballot requests if Husted\u2019s plan became law\u2014excluding the trio of toss-out states.\n\nSo how does Husted fare on the Truth-O-Meter.\n\nHe said if his plan were put in place, the voting window \"will be one of the most aggressive early voting time frames in America.\" But Husted isn\u2019t even close. Ohio would rank 21st among 34 states that offer early in-person voting and 39th among 47 states that offer absentee voting.\n\nHis assertion is so wrong, it\u2019s ridiculous. And as the top elections officer in the state of Ohio, he has a responsibility to get it right.\n\nFor that kind of statement, PolitiFact Ohio \"aggressively\" strikes a match to his well-tailored trousers. We rate Husted\u2019s claim Pants On Fire.\n\n"}

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Conservative Renewal PAC \"Tom Leppert pledged to make Dallas a sanctuary city for illegal immigrants.\"", "evidence": "A TV ad aired by a political action committee favoring David Dewhurst for the U.S. Senate includes this claim about a former Dallas mayor likewise seeking the Republican Senate nomination: \"Tom Leppert pledged to make Dallas a sanctuary city for illegal immigrants.\"\n\nHe did?\n\nBroadly, the idea of sanctuaries for immigrants gained currency in some quarters in the 1980s as citizens of strife-torn countries in Central America sought refuge in the United States. Of late, in contrast, the \"sanctuary city\" label has been bandied to refer to communities that do not routinely identify and detain illegal immigrants.\n\nFor instance, a Sept. 19, 2011, Austin American-Statesman news story about Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s unsuccessful calls on Texas lawmakers to ban sanctuary cities said a \"sanctuary city prohibits law enforcement from asking about the immigration status of the people they detain.\"\n\nIn 2010, Perry and other foes of Texas Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White, formerly Houston\u2019s mayor, said he had offered sanctuary to illegal immigrants in the Bayou City. They pointed to a 2006 report by the Congressional Research Service listing Houston among 32 localities that had sanctuary policies.\n\nWe rated Perry\u2019s claim False. Houston police did not ask people what their immigration status is during routine patrols, but the only immigration-related action by White that we found relevant was intended to make it harder, not easier, for illegal immigrants to remain. On White\u2019s watch, Houston joined the federal Secure Communities program under which fingerprints of people detained by local law enforcement agencies are checked against those of criminal illegal immigrants kept by U.S.\u00a0 Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nAnd how did the Conservative Renewal PAC conclude that Leppert pledged to make Dallas a sanctuary city?\n\nIn an April 27, 2012, letter defending its ad, two lawyers for the PAC said Leppert, who was mayor from mid-2007 into February 2011, signed an ACORN pledge while running for mayor that was tantamount to promising to make the city a sanctuary. ACORN, since folded, was a left-leaning voter registration and advocacy group.\n\nAccording to the lawyers\u2019 letter, the Leppert-signed pledge said: \"If elected, I will respect the fact that immigration policy is a federal issue and does not fall under the city's domain.\" The lawyers\u2019 letter offers as analysis: \"This is a pledge to refrain from undertaking to enforce immigration laws in Dallas. ... This is indisputably a pledge to uphold Dallas\u2019s status as a \u2018sanctuary city.\u2019\"\n\nWe failed to land a readable copy of the original pledge either from the PAC, which did not provide one, or Leppert. (An online video posted by a Dallas Morning News reporter in May 2011 appears to show Leppert attending an ACORN gathering; an immigration-related pledge, displayed on the wall, twice appears, partly viewable, in the background.)\n\nLeppert\u2019s campaign spokesman, Daniel Keylin, confirmed by telephone that Leppert signed a pledge stating that immigration law enforcement is a federal duty. However, he said, he's not 100 percent certain that it had the language cited in the TV ad.\n\nSeparately, our online search for news articles on any Leppert \"sanctuary\" pledge came up empty, although a July 8, 2007, editorial in the Dallas Morning News said Leppert had pledged to create a city office of immigrant affairs.\n\nAsked for elaboration, Keylin noted a July 3, 2007, Morning News news article (likely the basis of the editorial) indicating that Leppert supported such an office, which activists were pushing. \"All I want is to make sure we have a clear direction,\" the article quotes Leppert as saying. \"Who does it serve and how are we going to measure its success?\" According to the article, the advocates envisioned it helping legal and illegal immigrants assimilate.\n\nKeylin told us via email that one reason the office did not come to be is that Leppert did not want it to serve illegal immigrants.\n\nKeylin reminded us, too, that most individuals arrested in Dallas are processed at the county jail where fingerprints are shared through the Secure Communities program, which the county joined while Leppert was mayor.\n\nDuring Leppert\u2019s time as mayor, Keylin said, the Dallas City Council did not take up or pass an ordinance to help out illegal immigrants.\n\nKeylin noted, too, a Jan. 14, 2011, American-Statesman news article indicating that in Austin, Travis County and Houston, local policies barred law enforcement officers from stopping people to determine their immigration status or because they thought someone was in the country illegally.\n\nKeylin insisted that is not the case in the City of Dallas, though the January 2011 Statesman story says that police and sheriff's officials in Austin, Dallas and Houston said they don't enforce immigration laws or ask people about their immigration status, in part to encourage people to report crimes and work with police. The story says Dallas County sheriff and Houston police policies note the role undocumented immigrants play in law enforcement. According to the story, Dallas County\u2019s policy, put in place in 2010, says: \"Participation and involvement of the undocumented aliens' community in law enforcement activities will increase the Sheriff's Department's ability to protect and serve the entire community.\"\n\nThe Statesman story, quoting a Dallas County sheriff\u2019s detective, says that when an individual is booked into jail after being arrested, an officer fills out a booking sheet that asks place of birth. Those born outside the U.S. may be questioned further by a federal immigration officer stationed at the booking site, the detective, Raul Reyna, is quoted as saying.\n\nWe turned next to federal and municipal authorities.\n\nBy email, ICE spokeswoman Leticia Zamarripa confirmed that the Secure Communities program was activated in Dallas and Dallas County in November 2008, which was more than a year into Leppert\u2019s time as mayor.\n\nBroadly, Tom Perkins, city attorney for the City of Dallas, told us in a telephone interview: \"There is no ordinance or City Council resolution that designates Dallas as a sanctuary city and there is no Dallas City Council ordinance or regulation that prohibits Dallas police officers from inquiring into (the) immigration status\" of individuals stopped for questioning.\n\nHe also mentioned the Dallas Police Department\u2019s instruction to police officers, titled \"Illegal Immigrants.\" Melinda Gutierrez, a spokeswoman for the Dallas Police Department, later sent us the latest version of General Order 315.04, which was revised Feb. 17, 2011, about a week before Leppert resigned as mayor.\n\nThe order, similar to a September 2008 version we found in a report by the Washington-based Police Foundation, opens: \"The U.S. Immigration Code denies us the authority to enforce its provisions; therefore, we do not enforce immigration laws. All other laws apply to illegal immigrants.\"\n\nThe order continues: \"Officers will not stop or contact citizens for the sole purpose of determining immigration status.\" Gutierrez, asked if this means officers ask into the immigration status of individuals in other instances, told us by telephone: \"It\u2019s not something we generally do.\"\n\nAlso from the order: \"Arrest reports will contain arrest elements only and not refer to immigration status.\"\n\nFederal immigration \"agents have the sole responsibility for determining the immigration status of incarcerated persons,\" the order says, and federal agents assigned to the Lew Sterrett Justice Center, where suspects are detained, \"review arrest reports submitted to the Dallas County Sheriff\u2019s Office, and then decide which inmates to investigate for possible immigration violations.\" Also, the order says, if immigration authorities advise that someone should be detained for an immigration violation, the person will be held by the police. Finally, the order says, city charges will be dropped on request of the immigration agency.\n\nGutierrez, asked how long the policy of not stopping individuals solely to check on their immigration status had been in place, sent us a May 1996 special order to department employees from Bennie R. Click, then the police chief. The memo said the department was revising procedures for handling criminal suspects who may also be illegal immigrants to eliminate duplication of the efforts of federal immigration officials and to clarify that Dallas officers not \"make investigative stops for the sole purpose of determining citizenship, nor make arrests for immigration law violations.\" The full revised order regarding illegal immigrants, shown in the memo, is similar to the 2008 and 2011 versions.\n\nSo, for more than 15 years, the Dallas Police Department has had a policy advising police officers against inquiring into the immigration status of individuals, though it also says federal officials routinely review local arrest reports and decide which inmates to investigate for immigration violations.\n\nin a telephone interview, Hubert Williams, president of the Police Foundation, which supports police departments staying out of immigration law enforcement, said \"sanctuary city\" can be considered a \"glittering generality,\" implying a place where people illegally in the United States can go and nothing will happen to them. Still, he said, local police will arrest any individuals who break state or local laws. \"If you go to Dallas and you violate their laws, they\u2019re going to lock you up,\" he said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nWe were hampered by not being offered, or finding, the original described pledge.\n\n"}

And while the related statements PolitiFact previously checked focused specifically on people older than 50, Coleman\u2019s claim mentioned \"seniors\" more generally, making it more sweeping.\nThere is no precise age of a senior, but Merriam-Webster defines it as an elderly person.\nBefore the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, older adults paid about four or five times the premiums charged to younger adults for the same coverage, according to an analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading authority on health care.\u00a0\nThe Affordable Care Act changed the game by putting a cap on the amount that insurance companies could spike premiums for older adults. Under the new rules, insurers could charge older adults no more than three times the amount paid by younger adults.\nBut Section 135 of the AHCA would have increased the cap so insurance companies could have charged some people older than 50 up to five times what younger adults had to pay. The same provision would have also allowed states to set their own standards.\n\n"}
{"label": "pants-fire", "claim": "Mitt Romney Says Barack Obama said, \"If we keep talking about the economy, we\u2019re going to lose.\"", "evidence": "On the eve of a presidential trip to New Hampshire on Nov. 22, 2011, Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign released an ad targeting President Barack Obama. In the ad, the Romney campaign used a quote that prompted an immediate counterattack from the Obama camp, which argued that it had been taken out of context.\n\nThe 60-second ad, called \"Believe in America,\" is designed to contrast \"candidate Obama from 2008 with President Obama of today,\" highlighting \"his failures in between,\" according to the Romney campaign.\n\nThe ad contrasts a 2008 campaign speech by Obama with text on the screen that criticizes Obama\u2019s economic record, including, \"Greatest Jobs Crisis Since Great Depression,\" \"Record Home Foreclosures\" and \"Record National Debt.\"\n\nThe ad then has a clip of Obama saying,\"If we keep talking about the economy, we\u2019re going to lose.\"\n\nThe clear implication is that Obama believes that his economic record is so bad that he will lose in 2012 unless he can steer the conversation away from the economy.\n\nBut the Obama camp, among others, immediately charged that the clip was taken out of context. Was it?\n\nHere\u2019s what Obama said in the October 2008 speech, which came about two weeks before he defeated Sen. John McCain:\n\n\"Even as we face the most serious economic crisis of our time, even as you are worried about keeping your jobs or paying your bills or staying in your homes, my opponent's campaign announced earlier this month that they want to \u2018turn the page\u2019 on the discussion about our economy so they can spend the final weeks of this election attacking me instead,\" Obama said in the speech. \"Sen. McCain's campaign actually said, and I quote, \u2018If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose.\u2019\"\n\nSo the comment is drastically different than the way it's portrayed in the Romney ad. Obama was actually saying that his opponent\u2019s campaign three years earlier had said, \"If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose.\" That context is not included in the Romney ad -- and leaving it out sends a profoundly different message.\n\nThe Romney camp seems to have anticipated this complaint. In a blog post published around the time the ad was released, Romney spokeswoman Gail Gitcho acknowledged that, \"Three years ago, candidate Barack Obama mocked his opponent\u2019s campaign for saying, \u2018If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose.\u2019\" She went on to say Obama is trying to distract voters from his economic record.\n\nOur ruling\n\nWe certainly think it\u2019s fair for Romney to attack Obama for his response to the economy. And the Romney camp can argue that Obama\u2019s situation in 2011 is ironic considering the comments he made in 2008. But those points could have been made without distorting Obama\u2019s words, which have been taken out of context in a ridiculously misleading way"}

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Pat Toomey \"Joe Sestak ... even wants to bring back the death tax, letting the IRS take half of your savings when you die.\"", "evidence": "In his Senate race against Rep. Joe Sestak, D-Pa., former Republican Rep. Pat Toomey is using a favorite GOP issue: taxes. In an ad, Toomey charges that \"Joe Sestak ... even wants to bring back the death tax, letting the IRS take half of your savings when you die.\"\n\nBefore we look at the substance of the ad, let's first take a closer look at what Toomey calls the \"death tax\" and what others call the \"estate tax.\"\n\nAccording to the IRS, the decades-old estate tax was levied until recently on \"your right to transfer property at your death. It consists of an accounting of everything you own or have certain interests in at the date of death,\" including such items as cash and securities, real estate, insurance, trusts, annuities and business interests. Various factors reduce the gross amount subject to the tax, such as mortgages and other debts, amounts passed to surviving spouses and a credit that shields upwards of $1 million per person, and double that for a couple.\n\nUnless Congress and the president act to eliminate it permanently, the estate tax won't exist at all for exactly one year -- 2010. This oddity came about as a result of the passage of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, which was one of the tax cuts proposed and signed by President George W. Bush. The 2001 law slowly ratcheted down the estate tax's rates and ratcheted up the amount excluded from the tax, concluding with a total elimination of the tax for 2010. At the end of 2010, the estate tax would return to its levels in the early part of the decade -- a $1 million exclusion and a 55 percent top rate -- though many\u00a0expect that Congress would either act before then to set new levels or eliminate the tax entirely.\n\nWe see two questions to ask in evaluating in Toomey's ad. The first is whether Sestak \"wants to bring back the death tax.\" The second is whether it's accurate to say that the tax \"(lets) the IRS take half of your savings when you die.\"\n\nOn the first question, both Toomey and Sestak have\u00a0points to make.\n\nToomey's camp points to votes Sestak took in Congress that supported continuation of the estate tax. In one of them, on Dec. 3, 2009, Sestak voted with 225 other Democrats (and no Republicans) to pass the Permanent Estate Tax Relief for Families, Farmers, and Small Businesses Act of 2009. This legislation -- which passed the House but stalled in the Senate -- would have established the top estate tax rate at 45 percent and set the exclusion rate at $3,500,000 per person or $7 million per couple. (This happens to be the Obama administration's proposal as well.) Immediately prior to that vote, Sestak voted against a GOP-backed \"motion to recommit\" that would have asked lawmakers to go back to the drawing board and permanently eliminate the tax.\n\nWhen we spoke to Sestak's camp, they confirmed that their candidate continues to support the position he voted for in the 2009 bill. However, they took issue with Toomey's characterization of his position as one that would \"bring back\" the tax. A Sestak spokesman noted that it was actually the 2001 bill -- which Toomey himself voted for -- that is the reason why the estate tax is set to pop back to life in 2011 (and at a higher tax rate and lower exclusion level than what Sestak supports).\n\nWe accept the Sestak camp's point, but we believe it's ultimately a bit of semantics. Toomey's main point is that, one way or another, Sestak, unlike Toomey, wants there to be an estate tax of some sort after the tax's disappearance in 2010, and the Sestak camp confirms that he stands by the estate tax parameters he voted for in 2009.\n\nNow to the second question -- the ad's claim that the tax \"(lets) the IRS take half of your savings when you die.\"\n\nOn the surface, what the ad says is close to true -- that is, unless Congress and the president agree to new terms before Dec. 31 of this year, the new top estate tax rate in 2010 would be 55 percent, which is slightly over the \"half\" indicated by the ad.\n\nHowever, the ad glosses over three pieces of context that\u00a0are important.\n\nThe first is that the ad says a reinstated tax would \"(let) the IRS take half of your savings when you die,\" giving the impression that many of those watching would be subject to it. Yet the reality is that in any given year, very few families would pay the tax, and all of them would be quite wealthy.\n\nAccording to calculations by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, the 2009 proposal Sestak voted for would levy the tax on 6,400 estates nationwide in 2011 -- about three-tenths of one percent of all those who die that year. (By comparison, the estate tax that would apply in 2011 without any congressional action would levy the tax on 44,200 estates -- still only 2 percent of deaths that year, but about seven times higher that what Sestak voted for.)\n\nThe second problem is that even those families that do pay the tax would not pay it on half their savings, as the ad states. Because of the exclusions, the \"effective\" tax rate -- that is, the tax levied divided by the total amount of assets considered under the tax -- averages around 20 percent, according to the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nThe last problem is that Sestak supports setting the estate tax rate at 45 percent. Even ignoring the much lower \"effective\" tax rate due to the $3.5 million-per-person exclusion, that top tax rate falls short of the \"half\" that Toomey's ad indicates.\n\nAdvocates of eliminating the estate tax defended the ad's distillation of a complicated subject.\n\n\"In politics, as opposed to policy writing, you have a very brief time to get across any message, so I don't think it is realistic for candidates to include all the caveats,\" said Dan Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. \"So I would view Toomey's ad as kosher, much as I would feel it would be acceptable if Sestak were to run an ad about Toomey wanting to 'put people's retirement incomes at the mercy of Wall Street.' It's Sestak's job to criticize Toomey's ad, just as it's Toomey's responsibility to to go after Sestak when his positions get caricatured.\"\n\nTo recap, while there is some truth to Toomey's claim because Sestak supports reviving the estate tax, Toomey exaggerates the scope of the tax, incorrectly implying that it would apply to far more taxpayers, and that it applies to their entire estates. In fact, only the wealthiest Americans would pay the tax under the proposal that Sestak supports, and the proposal would exclude $3.5 million per person and $7 million per couple"}

Ajello and Sen. Rhoda A. Perry argued for the need for better preventive medicine, including \"the full range of reproductive health care.\"\n\nUntil this year, health insurers could limit or even deny coverage to pregnant women if the insurer determined the pregnancy amounted to a so-called preexisting health condition. But that changed in March with the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration\u2019s overhaul of the health-care system.\n\nAnd in August, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services adopted guidelines for women\u2019s preventative preventive care that include coverage for contraception.\n\n\"It\u2019s about time!\" the legislators wrote of that measure. \"Nearly half of all pregnancies in the U.S. are unintended.\"\n\nNearly half? That caught our attention, so we decided to check it. \u00a0\n\nFirst, some background. \u00a0\n\nIn their commentary piece, they urged Rhode Island to support the creation of a health-insurance exchange, as all states are required to do under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe exchanges are intended to lower insurance costs by fostering competition among insurance providers.\n\nIn Rhode Island, legislation to create an exchange passed the Senate but died in a House committee. Perry cast one of six dissenting votes against the Senate bill, which had been amended to include a provision to prevent health insurers from using taxpayer money or subsidies to cover abortions. ( A House bill with no restrictions on abortion coverage was held for further study.)\n\nGovernor Lincoln Chafee issued an executive order in September to create an exchange.\n\nUnder the new federal rules, insurers will have to expand coverage for preventive care, including birth control. The expanded coverage is clearly a significant development if, as Ajello and Perry wrote, \"nearly half of all pregnancies in the U.S. are unintended.\"\n\nSo we asked the two lawmakers for their source in writing the piece.\n\nThe facts\n\nAjello directed us to The Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit organization based in New York City, which does research and policy analysis about sexual and reproductive health.\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute has produced two studies about unintended pregnancies in the United States. The most recent, \"Unintended pregnancy in the United States: incidence and disparities, 2006\u2019\u2019 published in August 2011, states that \u00a0\"nearly half (49%) of pregnancies were unintended in 2006.\"\n\nThe earlier study, \"Disparities in Rates of Unintended Pregnancy In the United States, 1994 and 2001,\u2019\u2019 also reported 49 percent of pregnancies in 2001 were unintended, a level unchanged from 1994.\n\nThe studies define an unintended pregnancy as one in which the pregnancy was either \"mistimed,\" meaning the woman did not want the pregnancy at the time of conception (even if she may have wanted to become pregnant at some future date), or which was \"unwanted,\" meaning that she did not want to become pregnant then or in the future.\n\n(Unintended pregnancies are an important public health issue, the study says, because they are associated with \"a number of adverse maternal behaviors and child health outcomes, including inadequate or delayed initiation of prenatal care, smoking and drinking during pregnancy, premature birth and lack of breastfeeding, as well as negative physical and mental health effects on children.\")\n\nOf the 6.7 million pregnancies in the United States in 2006, about 3.2 million were unintended, the 2006 study reported. Of the 3.2 million, the study said, 29 percent were \"mistimed,\" and 19 percent -- or 608,000 -- were \"unwanted.\"\n\nThe original study, as well as a footnote referencing the more recent one, were posted on the web site of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nA CDC spokeswoman confirmed that the Guttmacher studies are based on data from the CDC\u2019s National Survey of Family Growth, an ongoing survey of about 5,000 women each year whose responses are compiled in periodic reports that reflect the reproductive history of tens of thousands of women. The studies also rely on population data from the U.S. census.\n\nBoth studies reported that the share of total pregnancies that were \"unintended\" has remained unchanged at 49 percent.\n\nOur ruling\n\nPerry and Ajello stated that nearly half of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended. Two studies based on data from the U.S. census and the CDC reported that the share of unintended pregnancies in the United States was 49 percent.\n\nWe rule this claim True.\n\n(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

Clarke Jr., who has called Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele a soft-on-crime liberal, took aim at Abele on Feb. 19, 2012, four days after President Barack Obama visited Milwaukee.\n\nIn an interview with Milwaukee\u2019s WTMJ-TV (Channel 4), Clarke claimed that Abele used the 2012 county budget to kill Sheriff\u2019s Office funding for providing security for presidential and presidential candidate visits.\n\n\"The county executive, Chris Abele -- and he again substitutes his judgment for mine,\" Clarke said, pausing in mid-sentence.\n\n\"I asked for an increase for this year because it is a presidential campaign year. Wisconsin is a swing state; we're going to have a lot of presidential visits, campaign visits. We need additional money this year. Not only did they not give me additional money for this activity, they completely eliminated it.\"\n\nWas such funding really completely eliminated?\n\nAsked for evidence to support Clarke\u2019s claim, sheriff\u2019s spokeswoman Fran McLaughlin cited the county budget\u2019s elimination of the sheriff\u2019s community relations division.\n\n\"Because mounted patrol, dignitary protection, neighborhood watch and public demonstrations are not core services and can be provided by municipalities, this division is eliminated,\" saving nearly $450,000, Abele\u2019s budget says.\n\n\"Dignitary protection\" is the part of that allocation that covers sheriff\u2019s security for presidential and presidential candidate visits.\n\nSo, literally, Abele did eliminate funding earmarked in the budget for such security, as Clarke claimed.\n\nMcLaughlin said because of the budget cut, the Sheriff\u2019s Office did not cover freeway ramps during Obama\u2019s visit -- a task that normally accounts for the largest portion of the manpower assigned to dignitary protection. That was done instead by the State Patrol.\n\nBut does that mean no money is available from other parts of the budget for this task? No.\n\nFor instance, the Sheriff's Office participated in planning for the president's visit and contributed help with SWAT and K-9 teams at the airport and with some officers participating in the presidential motorcade, McLaughlin said.\n\nTwo days after Obama\u2019s visit, in the wake of criticism that Clarke was playing politics with the issue, the sheriff issued a statement suggesting that the elimination of the $450,000 line item wasn\u2019t the only hindrance in providing dignitary protection. He said he could not simply \"move money around\" to provide the usual presidential visit security because his overall budget, which is about $152 million, had been cut by $12 million.\n\nWe asked Abele\u2019s deputy chief of staff, John Zapfel, about Clarke\u2019s claim in the TV interview.\n\nHe said Clarke \"could have chosen to use his staff for protection (of Obama) rather than attending the Association of SWAT conference and vendor show.\"\n\nZapfel\u2019s reference was to a three-day Wisconsin Association of SWAT Personnel conference held in suburban Milwaukee; the final day was the same day as Obama\u2019s visit. Zapfel cited a report by Milwaukee\u2019s WISN-TV (Channel 12) that \"more than 15 and as many as 25\" SWAT team members were at the conference during Obama\u2019s visit.\n\nClarke\u2019s response to that report was a statement saying presidents are well protected by the Secret Service and that \"local law enforcement provides a support role.\"\n\nInterestingly, the WISN-TV story was done by reporter Brendan Conway, who two weeks later announced he was becoming Abele\u2019s spokesman. In his new role, Conway also responded to our request for information on Clarke\u2019s claim.\n\nConway said Clarke has the flexibility to reallocate money in his budget if he wanted to provide the same level security as in the past for presidential campaign visits. To underline his point, he noted that during the 2012 budget process, Clarke in October 2011 said he would refuse to make most of the changes that Abele called for in his budget, such as eliminating a boot camp-style inmate program and using deputies to patrol parks and the Milwaukee lakefront.\n\nIndeed, Clarke, as an independently elected official, isn't required to allocate the money as specified by the overall county budget. He can shift funds internally as he deems necessary, even if that strays from budget language. County supervisors have readily acknowledged the sheriff's power trumps the county board and executive's budget authority.\n\nOur rating\n\nClarke said Abele \"eliminated\" sheriff\u2019s funding for providing security for presidential and presidential campaign visits.\n\nSo-called \"dignitary protection\" was among the services included in a nearly $450,000 line item that Abele deleted from Clarke\u2019s budget. Moreover, Clarke\u2019s total budget was trimmed, limiting his overall ability to provide various services.\n\nBut despite the line-item cut, Clarke did provide some security services for Obama\u2019s visit. And he has the authority, as an independently elected official, to reallocate funds allocated to him by Abele and the County Board.\n\nClarke\u2019s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details"}
{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "No Casinos Nevada is No. 1 in unemployment, violent crime, car theft, divorce, robberies and foreclosures.", "evidence": "\"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas\" is a common advertising slogan for Las Vegas. And those who oppose the introduction of mega-casinos in Florida say they want those casinos -- and the problems in Nevada -- to stay there.\n\nIn a \"Leave it in Vegas\"\u00a0television ad that launched Jan. 19, 2012, the group No Casinos claims that Nevada is No. 1 in lots of rankings -- and not in a good way. Set to sinister music, the ad states:\n\n\"Big gambling . . . \u00a0\nThey Say Florida's the Next Vegas.\nThat Nevada's Number One . . .\nAnd its true.\nNo. 1 in Unemployment.\nNo. 1 in Violent Crime.\nIn Car Theft.\nDivorce . . .\nIn Robberies.\nNo. 1 in Foreclosures.\nWhat happens in Vegas Should Stay in Vegas.\nTell Our Elected Officials: Keep Big Gambling Out of Florida.\"\n\nThe ad packs an emotional punch with photos of what appears to be a homeless man huddling under a blanket, a jail cell, the flashing lights of a squad car and a for sale/foreclosure sign by a house.\n\nWe checked some similar claims about Nevada in the past by the CEO of the Florida Chamber of Commerce -- a group that opposes casino expansion. But the new ad by No Casinos includes two additional claims about Nevada -- car theft and robberies -- and it started airing during the state legislative session, in the heat of the debate about whether to pass a bill to allow casino resorts.\n\nNo Casinos pointed us to a document from CQ Press that compares states on multiple rankings and is based on data from the census, Small Business Administration, FBI and administrative office of the U.S. courts. The document is the most recent version of the state ranking book, said Dan Gelber, South Florida chairman of No Casinos.\n\nUnemployment: Nevada\u2019s unemployment rate was 13 percent in November 2011 -- placing it at No. 1 among states, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nCrime: For the statistics about violent crime, car theft and robberies we turned to the FBI\u2019s 2010 statistics which show the rate per 100,000 people. (The 2011 data is still preliminary.) Nevada\u2019s violent crime rate was second highest in the country behind the District of Columbia. Nevada's rate for robberies was third, behind D.C. and Delaware. The rate for car theft was third, behind California and Washington state. (The District of Columbia isn\u2019t a state so we won\u2019t hold that one against No Casinos.)\n\nThe CQ data cited by No Casinos was for 2009. It showed Nevada at No. 1 for violent crime, robberies and car theft. That data showed Florida at No. 8 for violent crime, no. 6 for robberies and 14th for car theft.\n\nForeclosures: RealtyTrac, which tracks foreclosures, showed Nevada at the highest in the country for December 2011 with one foreclosure for every 177 homes.\n\nDivorce: CQ used 2009 data from the National Center for Health Statistics, which found that Nevada had the highest divorce rate among states reporting (6.7 per 1,000 population) -- and Florida was 9th. We corroborated the data through the National Center.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nWe should note that six states did not collect information for 2009. Center spokesman Jeffrey Lancashire said the group no longer collects detailed divorce data because not all the states collect the information.\n\nThe\u00a0Census also measures marital status rates for each state. The census shows that Nevada had a divorce rate of 12.3 percent for males and 14.6 percent for females between 2005 and 2007. According to the census, Wyoming had a slightly higher rate of divorced males -- 12.6 percent -- but Nevada was No. 1 for divorced females.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nAnother product created by the U.S. Census Bureau, the 2010 American Community Survey showed that Nevada had a 12.4 percent divorce rate for women -- placing it in a tie for 9th place with Tennessee -- and a 14 percent divorce rate for men -- ranking it first.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nNevada vs. Florida\n\n"}

Chris Murphy, has been getting rich in Congress.\n\nThe ad focuses on Social Security and Medicare, but it includes a momentary detour into how much Murphy got paid for his labors in the Capitol.\n\nThe narrator asks, \"Why is Congressman Chris Murphy lying to you about Linda McMahon and Social Security? Because while Murphy was raking in $1 million in salary, he voted to cut Medicare for current recipients by $716 billion.\"\n\nAn on-screen visual reads: \"Congressman Chris Murphy: $1 million in taxpayer-funded salary.\"\n\nA reader asked us: Are members of Congress really paid $1 million salaries?\n\nActually, no. Not even close.\n\nSince Jan. 1, 2009, lawmakers have been paid $174,000 a year. The key to understanding the ad\u2019s claim comes from the fine print on the screen. It says, \"Congressional salaries 2007 through 2012.\"\n\nSo the ad is referring to Murphy\u2019s cumulative earnings over a six-year period and calling it his \"salary.\"\n\nWe checked a Congressional Research Service paper on lawmakers\u2019 salaries and found that if you add up the salary earned by Murphy over the six-year period since he was elected to Congress, it does come to more than $1.03 million.\n\n\"He\u2019s been in Congress six years, and he\u2019s cumulatively been paid $1 million dollars,\" said Todd Abrajano, communications director for the McMahon campaign. \u00a0\"It\u2019s pretty clear and straightforward.\"\n\nBut in our view, that\u2019s a ridiculous way of calculating \"salary,\" which is defined as \"a fixed regular payment, typically paid on a monthly or biweekly basis but often expressed as an annual sum.\"\n\nThe tremendous distortion of this claim is that it adds up multiple years and uses a terminology that suggests it is for one year.\n\nUsing their logic, we would say the median household income in the United States is more than $300,000.

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Marion Hammer The American Academy of Pediatrics \"supports banning guns.\"", "evidence": "One of the more intriguing subplots so far during the 2011 Florida\u00a0legislative session has been a fight between two powerful Tallahassee special interests -- the gun lobby and doctors.\n\nThe bills at issue are SB 432 and its companion HB 155. The measures, being pushed by gun interests, would prohibit doctors from asking their patients, or their patients' families, if they keep a gun at home. An original version of the bill made it a felony punishable with up to a $5 million fine for asking whether a patient owned a firearm. An amended version lowered the penalty to a non-criminal violation with a $500 fine (which could grow if the doctor willfully broke the law or was a repeat offender).\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics currently encourages physicians to counsel parents on creating a safe home environment and offers advice to avoid preventable accidents. The long list of recommendations includes mainly innocuous tips like \"Keep plastic bags and balloons away from your children,\" and \"NEVER place an infant in front of an air bag.\" But physicians also are told to tell parents to remove guns from places where children live and play.\n\nPreviously, we've looked into a claim by\u00a0state Rep. Jason Brodeur, R-Sanford, that part of the reasoning behind the bill he sponsored\u00a0is to keep gun ownership information from being recorded and collected by the federal government and insurance companies as part of the federal health care law. We rated that claim False, noting that the federal health care law specifically prohibits doctors and insurance companies from collecting gun information.\n\nMarion Hammer, a longtime lobbyist for the Unified Sportsmen of Florida and a former president of the National Rifle Association, offered another reason to support the gun legislation. Doctors are playing politics in the exam room by asking a question they don't need to know the answer to.\n\n\"Doctors are pushing gun-ban politics on their patients,\" Hammer told a Senate committee on Feb. 22, 2011. Hammer made similar comments to a House committee on March 8, as well as in this e-mail to gun-rights supporters. \"They have been pushing a gun-ban agenda and have been bringing their gun-ban politics into examining rooms.\n\n\"The American Academy of Pediatrics supports banning guns,\" she said. \"It's blatant, and it's there on their website. All you have to do is log on and see it.\"\n\nSo log on to the academy's website we did, at www.aap.org.\n\nSure enough, we quickly found a long list of policy statements, including a policy paper called \"Firearm-Related Injuries Affecting the Pediatric Population.\" The academy says its policy on firearm-related injuries was first set in 1992 and reaffirmed in 2004.\n\nThe policy paper says that in 1997, 32,436 firearm-related deaths occurred in the United States, and 4,223 of the victims were children and teenagers under 20. The paper also says that in 1997, 306 children and teens under 20 were killed by firearms as a result of unintentional firearm-related injuries.\n\nThe academy then makes several recommendations to reduce firearm-related injuries.\n\nThe first recommendation is that \"the most effective measure to prevent firearm-related injuries to children and adolescents is the absence of guns from homes and communities,\" the academy writes. \"Firearm regulation, to include bans of handguns and assault weapons, is the most effective way to reduce firearm-related injuries.\"\n\nOther recommendations include urging pediatricians to inform parents about the danger of guns, advocating for trigger locks and other safety mechanisms, and supporting the development of nonviolent, gun-free television programs and video games.\n\nThe policy paper clearly supports banning handguns and assault weapons, but it does not explicitly advocate a complete ban on\u00a0guns, which likely would require an amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It addresses legal concerns by saying the federal government could ban \"whole categories of firearms.\"\n\nThe academy notably also supported Chicago's handgun ban in a case that came before the U.S. Supreme Court. \"The best way to truly protect children from firearm injuries is to get guns out of their homes, their neighborhoods and where they play,\" said AAP President Judith S. Palfrey. \"If we don't, too many children will continue to be hurt or die needlessly.\"\n\nAnd Hammer pointed us toward another position statement that she said had been on a second AAP website, www.healthychildren.org. \"The most effective way to prevent firearm-related injury to children is to keep guns out of homes and communities. The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly supports gun-control legislation. We believe that handguns, deadly air guns and assault weapons should be banned.\"\n\nThat statement appears to have been replaced on the website. The statement on \"where we stand\" now reads: \"The safest home for a child is a home without a gun. However, if a gun is present in the home of a child, the gun should be stored unloaded and locked, with the ammunition locked separately, so that a child cannot access the gun.\"\n\nInterestingly, some gun-control groups have realized the use of the word \"ban\" is a red flag and have tried to avoid it. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, for instance, says it is not a \"gun-ban\" organization and that \"a safer America can be achieved without banning guns.\" Brady does say certain types of guns, such as military-style assault weapons like Uzis and AK-47s, should be \"out of bounds for private ownership.\"\n\nDebbie Linchesky, a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Pediatrics, referred comment on the issue to Louis St. Petery, a Leon County pediatrician and member of the academy's Florida chapter.\n\nSt. Petery said Hammer is distorting the position of doctors.\n\n\"It's certainly a mischaracterization of where we are on things,\" St. Petery said. \"Forty percent of folks in this country own guns. We (my family) own a gun.\n\n\"It's not that we feel that guns need to be eliminated from the face of the Earth, which is what Ms. Hammer would suggest,\" he said.\n\nSt. Petery said doctors aren't pushing a political agenda; rather, they're trying to keep children safe. If doctors know someone owns a pool, they want to use their limited time with a patient discussing pool safety. If doctors know someone owns a gun, they want to discuss gun safety, he said.\n\n\"We are trying to do the best job we can to protect children,\" St. Petery said. \"We feel that's our job, prevention is what it's about.\"\n\nThat brings us back to Hammer's claim. In making her case to support a bill that would make it illegal for doctors to ask patients about guns, Hammer says doctors -- particularly pediatricians -- are bringing politics into the exam rooms. We cannot make a judgment on that, but we can assess her claim that the American Academy of Pediatrics \"supports banning guns.\"\n\nWe found no evidence that the academy supports an outright ban on all guns. But the academy does say that \"firearm regulation, to include bans of handguns and assault weapons, is the most effective way to reduce firearm-related injuries.\" It also voiced support for Chicago's handgun-ban law. We think Hammer could have been slightly more clear in making her case to the Legislature"}
{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Donald Trump Says \"no, you\u2019re wrong,\" responding to the assertion that stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York.", "evidence": "Donald Trump has been pushing for cities to expand stop-and-frisk policies in order to combat crime, but some argue it\u2019s a form of racial profiling.\nAt the Sept. 26 presidential debate, moderator Lester Holt asked Trump what he would do to heal racial divides. Trump said the country needs to \"bring back law and order\" in inner cities and praised stop-and-frisk policies in Chicago and New York. Then\u00a0Holt jumped in with what sounded like a \u00a0fact-check.\n\"Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men,\" Holt posed to Trump.\n\"No, you're wrong,\" Trump responded. \"It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed.\"\nWhenever there\u2019s a disagreement over who has their facts right, we\u2019re compelled to sort it out. So the question of whether stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York piqued our interest.\nAs it turns out, Holt and Trump are both a little bit right and a little bit wrong. But Trump's more wrong than Holt.\nStop-and-frisk is the practice of a police officer stopping and questioning a person (the stop), then patting the person down for weapons (the frisk). Stops and frisks are legal, in New York and everywhere else.\nIn its decision in the 1968 case Terry vs. Ohio, the Supreme Court ruled 8-1 that an officer can legally stop a person if the officer has reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot. And if the officer has a reasonable suspicion that this person is armed, he or she can legally frisk the person for weapons. Because of that reasonable suspicion standard, the court said these stops would be consistent with the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable search and seizure.\nA 2013 case before the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Floyd vs. City of New York, raised the issue of the constitutionality of New York City\u2019s stop-and-frisk policies between 2004 and 2012.\nJudge Shira Scheindlin found that New York City had been conducting unconstitutional stops and frisks on two grounds: Officers were stopping and frisking people without reasonable suspicion, in violation of Terry and the Fourth Amendment; and a disproportionate number of those stopped and frisked were minorities, in violation of the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\"Both statistical and anecdotal evidence showed that minorities are indeed treated differently than whites,\" Scheindlin wrote in her opinion. \"For example, once a stop is made, blacks and Hispanics are more likely to be subjected to the use of force than whites, despite the fact that whites are more likely to be found with weapons or contraband.\"\nSo Holt was right to note that a court found New York City had an unconstitutional stop-and-frisk policy because police had been disproportionately targeting black and Hispanic people.\nBut the Floyd case was specific to New York City\u2019s particular way of conducting stops and frisks between 2004 and 2012. Scheindlin did not rule all stops and frisks unconstitutional, and her findings were consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Terry. Scheindlin ruled that New York City could continue to conduct stops and frisks as long as they made some changes.\n\"Stop-and-frisk was not outlawed,\" said Andrew Schaffer, former deputy commissioner for legal matters for the New York Police Department and an adjunct professor at New York University Law School. The ruling only sought to correct a supposed problem of officers making stops without a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity and disproportionately stopping black and Hispanic people.\n\n"}

But we decided to investigate specifically the most hard-hitting part of the ad, that he backed legislation that cost consumers money.\nThe \"costly state energy regulations\" the ad refers to is North Carolina\u2019s Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard, established in 2007, eight years before McCready was elected to the NCSEA board. It requires all investor-owned utilities in North Carolina to get 12.5% of their retail electricity sales from eligible renewable energy resources by 2021.\nIn 2015, a bill in the state House, House Bill 760, would have revised the standard to only require utilities to get 6% of their electricity from renewable energy resources. This legislation passed the House but died in committee in the Senate. A 2015 report from the North Carolina secretary of state\u2019s office shows NCSEA spent $288,842.97 on lobbying that year.\nWe couldn\u2019t find research showing what would have happened to costs if HB 760 had become law.

So we asked her office where the numbers came from.\n\nSchmidt was president of Right-to-Life of Greater Cincinnati before she was elected to Congress and currently chairs the House Pro-Life Women\u2019s Caucus. She referred us to reports produced by several anti-abortion organizations, including Americans United for Life, Concerned Women for America, Liberty Counsel Action, Family Research Council Action, and the Chiaroscuro Foundation.\n\nAll stated that roughly 98 percent of Planned Parenthood\u2019s services to pregnant women consist of abortion. They derived their information from a March 2011 fact sheet from Planned Parenthood. That fact sheet says the group performed 332,278 abortions in 2009, referred 977 patients to other agencies for adoptions, and provided prenatal care to 7,021 patients.\n\nThe anti-abortion groups came up with the 98 percent figure by comparing the number of abortions to the number of procedures in the other two categories. Schmidt\u2019s 32 out of 33 statistic works out to 97 percent - the approximate percentage her sources provided.\n\nBut there are problems with that calculation.\n\nFirst, it assumes that pregnant women only go to Planned Parenthood for one of those three options.\n\nPlanned Parenthood representatives say that interpretation overstates the ratio of abortions among its pregnant clients. It ignores other statistics, such as the 1,158,924 pregnancy tests the group provided, and the fact that those 332,278 abortions were just 3 percent of the 11,383,900 total procedures that Planned Parenthood health centers provided that year to its 3 million patients.\n\nThirty five percent of its services consisted of providing contraception and another 35 percent consisted of testing for sexually transmitted diseases and treatment.\n\nThe fact sheet stats also don\u2019t reflect the fact that only a tiny proportion of Planned Parenthood centers around the country provide prenatal care - just 63 out of more than 800, said Tait Sye, a spokesman for the organization. Those that don\u2019t offer prenatal care refer pregnant women to other health care providers for those services, and Planned Parenthood doesn\u2019t keep track of those referrals. And the 7,021 figure for prenatal clients that was used in the calculations doesn\u2019t include pregnant women who went to Planned Parenthood for prenatal care and were sent to outside obstetricians.\n\nThe group doesn\u2019t \"ask the pregnancy status of every woman that walks into Planned Parenthood,\" and plenty of pregnant women use the organization for other services, like breast exams, Sye said. \u00a0Consequently, he says it\u2019s \"impossible to calculate an accurate percentage if you don\u2019t know the total number of pregnant women it is based on.\"\n\nIn an emailed statement, Planned Parenthood Vice President for Communications Stuart Schear called Schmidt\u2019s assertion \"a meaningless and unverifiable statistic since Planned Parenthood does not collect information on the pregnancy status of every female patient who comes into our health centers.\"\n\nWhen Schmidt was asked about the points made by Planned Parenthood\u2019s spokesmen, she said the group \"obfuscates the truth by comparing apples to oranges \u2013 or services to patients.\"\n\n\"They say 90 percent of the services they provide are preventative, but more than 10 percent of their patients are provided an abortion,\" Schmidt said in an email. \"They say they don't know the number of pregnant women they serve. It shouldn't be that hard to figure out. Whether a patient is pregnant or not should be one of the first questions they ask.\" \u00a0\n\nSchmidt is correct that women of childbearing age are routinely asked whether they might be pregnant when they visit a doctor\u2019s office. Sye acknowledged that Planned Parenthood\u2019s intake form contains a question that asks whether female patients are pregnant. \"But, we don\u2019t tally the number of women we see every year who are pregnant or not pregnant,\" he said.\n\nPolitiFact recently fact checked a statement Sen. John Kyl made about Planned Parenthood. In that item we noted a few caveats that are worth repeating.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFirst, we think many people would acknowledge a difference between providing an abortion and, say, handing out a pack of condoms or conducting a blood test. The former is a significant surgical procedure, whereas the latter are quick and inexpensive services. So Planned Parenthood\u2019s use of \"services\" as its yardstick likely decreases abortion\u2019s prominence compared to what other measurements would show. Using dollars spent or hours devoted to patient care would likely put abortion above 3 percent in the calculations. So Schmidt does have a point about citing services, rather than patient numbers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSecond, it\u2019s worth noting that Planned Parenthood self-reported these numbers, although the group says each affiliate\u2019s numbers are independently audited. (There is no single, national audit.) So we have no choice but to accept their accuracy more or less on faith.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat certainly is true is that without knowing the total number of pregnant women that Planned Parenthood sees, it is impossible to compute an accurate ratio for how many of them get abortions.\n\nPolitiFact places the burden of proof on the speaker. In this case, Schmidt cannot meet that burden because information needed for that showing is unknown.\n\nAnti-abortion groups and Schmidt can try to fill the information vacuum by using Planned Parenthood\u2019s incomplete data to come up with their own number. \u00a0But that doesn\u2019t mean that their number is correct.\n\nThe fact sheet shows that Planned Parenthood does a sizable number of abortions. But the ratio she cites (97 percent) is extreme.\n\nSye noted that just 63 out of more than 800 Planned Parenthood centers provide their own prenatal care. That means that pregnant women seeking prenatal care from more than 700 centers would be referred to outside providers.\n\nWomen seeking prenatal care are not likely to be seeking an abortion, and none of those women are included in the totals cited by Schmidt\u2019s sources.\n\nSchmidt\u2019s claim also overlooks that pregnant women who \"walk into\" a clinic could be there for any reason, not just for pregnancy-related services"}

The very same report, however, notes that unemployment will average 10 percent for the rest of the year. The Obama administration promised the trillion-dollar 'stimulus' would create jobs 'immediately' and keep joblessness below 8 percent.\"The report does, in fact, project that the unemployment rate will hover at about 10 percent through this year. With many press accounts of the economic report highlighting the forecast that job gains for 2010 will average 95,000 a month, those two facts may seem at odds. They are not.\"A certain number of jobs need to be created every month simply to hold the unemployment rate stable,\" said Gary Burtless, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. \"That's because the working-age population is growing.\"In addition, as the job market improves -- or is even perceived as improving -- some people who had given up on looking for work may get back in the game and be added to the unemployed ranks. So there would have to be about 100,000 jobs added a month just for the unemployment rate to tread water.Even still, the report says, there's evidence the labor market is stabilizing.That's because the economy shed 691,000 jobs in the first quarter of 2009, 428,000 in the second quarter, 199,000 in the third, and 69,000 in the fourth. So to have the number of jobs increasing even moderately is an improvement.But Boehner's statement includes an assumption masquerading as a fact: It's that the stimulus has failed if unemployment rates remain at 10 percent through the year.\n\n"}

As it turns out, immigration experts, multiple government officials, a Republican-appointed federal judge and countless reports of immigrants struggling to find loved ones all point to the absence of a federal government system for reuniting families separated under Trump\u2019s border policy.\nTrump\u2019s zero tolerance policy\nFirst, let\u2019s recap the Trump border policy that set things in motion.\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions in April announced a \"zero-tolerance\" policy, meaning every person caught crossing the border illegally would be referred for federal prosecution.\nA good number of these people have been adult migrants traveling with children. By law, when adults are detained and criminally prosecuted, their children cannot be housed with them in jail. As a result, under Trump\u2019s policy, more than 2,000 kids have been placed in a Department of Health and Human Services shelter pending release to a legal guardian.\nFacing intense political pressure, Trump issued an executive order on June 20 that instructed immigration authorities to keep families together during their legal proceedings, within existing legal and resource constraints. It was not clear how or if the order would affect children already separated from their families.\nWe reached out to the White House and Department of Homeland Security to ask about what system was in place, if any. We heard no response.\u00a0\nCrucial disconnects\nImmigration experts we spoke to highlighted crucial disconnects among federal agencies tasked with carrying out Trump\u2019s family separation policy.\nAny workable system for family reunification, experts said, requires coordination between three offices: Customs and Border Protection, which apprehended and separated families, the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which received children, and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which detained parents.\n\"While we don\u2019t know what conversations were occurring internally,\" said Mark Greenberg, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, \"there is just not evidence of planning and coordination to address how parents would know where their children were, how they could communicate, and how reunifications would occur.\"\nLouis Desipio, a political science professor at UC Irvine who specializes in immigration, said it\u2019s likely that senior civil servants anticipated the problem, but lacked authority to pump the brakes on Trump\u2019s aggressive policy shift to put an administrative structure in place.\n\"I don't believe there was a system in place when zero tolerance was implemented,\" Desipio told PolitiFact June 27. \"I haven't seen any evidence that they have improved the system in the past week or so.\"\nTrump administration officials acknowledged that reunifying families was being done on the fly, months after the zero tolerance policy was announced. As Steven Wagner, a Trump appointee at Health and Human Services told the Washington Post June 19, \"This policy is relatively new, and we\u2019re still working through the experience of reunifying parents with their kids after adjudication.\"\nDavid FitzGerald, who co-directs the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies, put it this way: \"The \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 policy was implemented with zero planning for putting families back together again.\"\nFederal judge: Government tracks property better than migrant kids\nAmid an international outcry over Trump\u2019s border policy, a lawsuit against the administration brought by a separated family percolated through a federal court in San Diego.\nDuring a hearing, Judge Dana Sabraw of the Southern District of California repeatedly pressed the government\u2019s lawyer on whether there was any system in place for keeping separated parents and children in contact. According to Politico, the judge \"sounded skeptical about the government\u2019s stance,\" citing an apparent lack of communication among key agencies on how to reunite families.\n\n"}

We'll also be adding it to our Obameter database of campaign promises.\n\n\nThe group's claim is virtually identical to one made in September by House Republican Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, who said in a statement that, \"during his quest for the presidency, now-President Obama declared that everyone deserves access to reproductive health care that includes abortion, and vowed that this 'right' would be at the heart of his health care reform plan if elected president.\"\n\n\nWe researched Boehner's claim and concluded he was right about Obama's promise. We rated the statement\n\nTrue\n\n.\n\n\nTo explore Obama's promise on abortion coverage in his health care plan, you need to go back to a July 17, 2007, speech he gave to the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. In that speech, he discussed his commitment to how \"reproductive care\" -- a term a campaign aide said included abortion coverage -- would fit into his health care reform plan.\n\n\nObama said, \"In my mind, reproductive care is essential care. It is basic care, so it is at the center and at the heart of the plan that I propose. Essentially what we're doing is, we\u2019re going to set up a public plan that all persons and all women can access if they don\u2019t have health insurance. It will be a plan that will provide all essential services, including reproductive services, as well as mental health services and disease management services, because part of our interest is to make sure that we\u2019re putting more money into preventive care.\"\n\n\nThe words Obama used in that speech mirror those in the Planned Parenthood Action Fund's recent alert even more closely than they did Boehner's formulation. So it's certainly correct, as the group says, that Obama \"campaigned on a promise to put reproductive health care at the center of his reform plan.\"\n\n\nIt's worth nothing that since he spoke to that group -- an important constituency for someone seeking the Democratic nomination -- he has chosen his words carefully.\n\n\nOf all the words Obama has spoken and written about health care reform since 2007 -- a voluminous amount, to be sure -- the terms \"abortion\" and \"reproductive health\" haven't popped up very often. Indeed, on several of the rare occasions in which Obama or his staff have broached the subject, it's been to assure Americans that his health care proposal would not promote abortions.\n\n\nFor instance, in his prime-time address to Congress on Sept. 9, 2009, Obama's only mention of abortion -- which came immediately after he was interrupted by the heckling Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C. -- was that \"one more misunderstanding I want to clear up: Under our plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions, and federal conscience laws will remain in place.\"\n\n\nThat's a reflection of the sensitivity surrounding the issue. Obama's promise to the abortion rights group during the primary campaign could now be a liability before a broader audience that includes many people opposed to abortion rights.\n\n\nStill, Planned Parenthood is correct that Obama campaigned on a promise that he would put reproductive health care at the center of his reform plan.\" After all, he was speaking to . . .

But some animal activists are outraged at the death of a critically endangered animal.\nOne dimension of this outrage, Limbaugh said, is people think they\u2019re related to gorillas.\n\"A lot of people think that all of us used to be gorillas, and they're looking for the missing link out there,\" Limbaugh said. \"The evolution crowd.

Tom Craddick, R-Midland, said in a Nov. 12, 2012, press release: \"Approximately 25 Texas cities have adopted an ordinance banning texting while driving.\" He also said: \"It is time for Texas to join the other 39 states\" in banning \"this dangerous behavior for all drivers.\"\n\nCraddick\u2019s House Bill 63 would bar the use of a wireless communication device to read, write or send a text-based communication while driving, except when a vehicle is stopped. The ban would not apply to hands-free devices or to dialing a number or using the GPS on a hand-held phone.\n\nPerry\u2019s June 17, 2011, message accompanying his veto of Craddick\u2019s previous proposal said that texting while driving is reckless and irresponsible, but the proposed change in law amounts to a \"government effort to micromanage the behavior of adults.\" Perry said the keys to \"dissuading drivers of all ages from texting while driving are information and education.\"\n\nNationally, according to a web post by the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 220 million people subscribe to wireless services and up to 80 percent of those subscribers use their phones while driving. Further, distracted driving including cell phone use figured into 16 percent of fatal U.S. crashes in 2009, up from 10 percent in 2005, as noted in a June 2011 Truth-O-Meter article.\n\nWe won\u2019t judge here whether restrictions on cell phone use affect accident rates.\n\nBut is Craddick correct that 39 states and about 25 Texas cities now bar texting while driving?\n\nTo our inquiry, Kate Huddleston of Craddick\u2019s office forwarded an email from Julian Hoffman of the National Safety Council stating that 39 states ban texting while driving. By email, Hoffman told us the council drew its count from information posted online with a map of the United States by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which describes itself as an effort funded by auto insurers dedicated to reducing deaths, injuries and property damage related to highway and roadway crashes.\n\nAn introduction to the institute\u2019s map of states with limits on texting while driving, dated November 2012, says: \"Text messaging is banned for all drivers in 39 states and the District of Columbia.\" The map indicates that six additional states, including Texas, have imposed partial bans. In Texas, an institute chart says, individuals barred from texting include drivers in school crossing zones; bus drivers when a passenger 17 or younger is present; and drivers younger than 18.\n\nStates lacking any such restrictions are Montana, Arizona, South Dakota, South Carolina and Florida, according to the map.\n\nWe asked the institute how it determined the states with such laws. Spokesman Russ Rader told us by phone: \"We track state laws. That\u2019s part of what we do.\"\n\nRader also sent a chart showing the date each state\u2019s texting-while-driving ban took effect.\nAmong the states, Connecticut had the first law, in 2005. The year 2010 had the highest count of any year with restrictions taking effect in 14 states. From January through August 2012, most recently, bans took effect in six states--Nevada, Pennsylvania, Idaho, West Virginia, Alabama and Ohio.\n\nSimilarly, the National Conference of State Legislatures says 39 states have banned texting while driving. Anne Teigen, a conference policy specialist, told us by phone that the group independently confirmed each state\u2019s ban.\n\nNext, we hunted breakdowns of the Texas cities that have banned texting while driving.\n\nAccording to a February 2012 report by the non-partisan House Research Organization, which analyzes legislative issues for the Texas House, Austin was the state\u2019s first city to do so, in November 2009. In total, the report says, at least 23 Texas cities approved bans.

Single women are earning less than married people and single men. Even women in Barack Obama\u2019s White House are earning less than men. \u2026 Barack Obama hasn\u2019t earned a second term.\"\n\nMany readers have asked us to check this claim, so we will.\n\nFor months, conservative bloggers and news outlets have been touting the statistic that women working for the White House earn 18 percent less than men do. The statistic stems from calculations published in April 2012 by the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative online publication.\n\n\"According to the 2011 annual report on White House staff, female employees earned a median annual salary of $60,000, which was about 18 percent less than the median salary for male employees ($71,000),\" the Beacon wrote. Put another way, that means women in the White House earned 85 percent of what the men earned. The statistic got a second round of attention as the discussion of women\u2019s pay disparities increased during the Democratic convention (where Ledbetter spoke) and in the debates.\n\nWhen we downloaded the same statistics from the White House website and ran the numbers, we came up with similar results -- $63,240 for women and $72,876 for men. So women in the White House, by our calculations, earn 87 percent of what their male colleagues at the White House do, not far off from what the Free Beacon found. (Some of the variation may be explained by differences in determining the sex of the 454 employees on the list. We were able to determine the sex of all but 18 employees.)\n\nThe gender pay gap we found provides support for the Romney mailer\u2019s claim that \"even women in Barack Obama's White House are earning less than men.\"\n\nHowever, we think it\u2019s worth pointing out a couple caveats.\n\nWomen at the White House fare better than women in the economy at large\n\nWe\u2019ve previously rated Mostly True the claim that women \"receive only 77 cents for every dollar a man earns.\" By that standard, women working for the White House suffer from a smaller gap than do women who work elsewhere.\n\nThe 77-cents and 87-cents figures don\u2019t reflect apples-to-apples comparisons\n\nThis is an issue that has tripped up Obama in the past: When Obama claimed earlier this year that \"women (are) paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men,\" we rated it Mostly False, since the 77-cent statistic does not factor in what occupations are held, how many hours are worked or how long someone has been in the job.\n\nWhen women do the same job as men, the pay gap narrows quite a bit. And in fact, this is exactly what happens when you look deeper into the White House data. Even when you just control for one factor -- people who have the same job title -- the gap narrows significantly.\n\nWe found 36 titles for full employees held by more than one person, including at least one man and woman. Of these 36 job categories, there was no difference in pay between men and women in 22 job categories, affecting 121 employees. In another six categories affecting 29 employees, the highest earner in the category was a woman who out-earned at least one man.\n\nIn only eight cases affecting 22 employees -- in other words, a small fraction of all employees -- was the highest earner a man who out-earned at least one woman. In a large majority of job categories, there was no salary edge for men. And even in the cases where men did have an edge, it was a small edge -- the lowest-paid women mostly earned between 92 percent and 98 percent of what the top-paid men did.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget that we\u2019re only adjusting the data using one factor -- job title. There are other factors that could explain different salaries for people who hold the same job title, such as prior work experience, specific skill sets and the number of years they have spent in the job.\n\n"}

It's 2008, we are having an election, and candidate Obama, he's not even president-elect, sends William Miller over to Iran to establish a back channel and let the Iranians know that should he win the election, they will have friendlier terms,\" Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberley Strassel said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on May 28.\nCandidate Obama faced criticism for saying he would talk to Iranian leaders as president. And after he took office, his administration pursued back-channel communications \u2014 meaning secret dialogue outside normal diplomatic processes \u2014 with Iran as part of achieving the nuclear deal. Journalists reported on those processes extensively.\nWe were intrigued by the claim that Obama sought secret communication channels with Iran before he even won the 2008 election. When we started to dig into it, we were surprised to find that the evidence supporting that narrative is slim and ultimately insufficient.\nAs far as we can tell, this allegation stems solely from the commentary of Michael Ledeen, a conservative Iran and Iraq expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a critic of Obama\u2019s foreign policy.\nLedeen was also a national security consultant to President Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration. He recently co-authored a book with Trump\u2019s ousted National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies.\nStrassel hasn\u2019t replied to our requests for comment, but she defended her comment on Twitter by citing Ledeen\u2019s work.\nBy Ledeen\u2019s account, Miller told him that Obama sent him to Tehran in 2008. Ledeen has made this claim a number of times since at least 2013, in blog posts, on conservative talk radio, on Twitter in prepared remarks, and in a phone interview with PolitiFact June 1.\n\"During his first presidential campaign in 2008, Mr. Obama used a secret back channel to Tehran to assure the mullahs that he was a friend of the Islamic Republic, and that they would be very happy with his policies,\" Ledeen wrote in 2014 for conservative website PJ Media. \"The secret channel was Ambassador William G. Miller, who served in Iran during the shah's rule, as chief of staff for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and as ambassador to Ukraine. Ambassador Miller has confirmed to me his conversations with Iranian leaders during the 2008 campaign.\"\nWe called up Miller. He said Ledeen\u2019s claims are \"totally untrue.\"\nMiller told us that he supported Obama\u2019s 2008 candidacy and knew some of the campaign\u2019s foreign policy staff from his decades-long public service career, but he had no role in the campaign or the subsequent administration.\n\n"}

The latest attempt involves a House spending bill, which would keep the federal government running through mid-December, but also strip all funding for the Affordable Care Act.\nObama has already threatened to veto the bill, but as the proposal was being debated, U.S. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter, a Democrat, was quick to denounce it. When it came up for a vote on Sept. 20, 2013, Shea-Porter joined nearly every other member of her party in voting against the resolution, which passed the House, 230-189.\nIn a written statement, Shea-Porter called the resolution (H.J.Res.59) an \"irresponsible political ploy,\" and said repealing Obamacare would increase the budget deficit. She cited information from the Congressional Budget Office, which provides nonpartisan analysis of the federal budget and the economy to Congress.\n\"I agree with most Americans that we should keep the government open, but Speaker Boehner and House Republicans are threatening to shut it down unless Congress defunds the Affordable Care Act, a law that was passed by Congress, signed by the President, and upheld by the Supreme Court,\" Shea-Porter said in the statement.\nIn addition to risking a government shutdown, she added, \"according to the Congressional Budget Office, repealing Obamacare would increase the budget deficit.\"\nWe wondered if her claim was true, so we checked the CBO\u2019s published research.\nWe found that the CBO has been asked to estimate the cost of repealing Obamacare twice previously. First, in July 2012, CBO projected that repealing the new health reform law would increase the deficit by an estimated $109 billion over a decade.\nCBO was asked to study repealing Obamacare a second time in May 2013. The office determined it didn't have enough time to do a full study, and referred Congress to its earlier projections from 2012.\nA closer look at the CBO\u2019s research shows that repealing Obamacare would increase the deficit because the net savings from eliminating new insurance mandates would be offset by spending increases and revenue reductions. Here\u2019s a broad look at the CBO\u2019s calculations:\n\u2022 The health care law expands health insurance coverage, but not without increasing some costs for the federal government. The law provides subsidies for some people who buy health insurance through new exchanges. It also increases spending on Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, and establishes tax credits for certain small employers. Repealing the new coverage provisions would yield a net savings of $1,171 billion over 10 years.\n\n"}

We are sure the claim wasn't intended as a joke, because it's included in a bullet-point list of straightforward criticisms of the law.\nSo let\u2019s start by looking at the claim literally. Is there any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would prevent U.S.-trained doctors from accepting \"Obamacare\" patients -- that is, patients who secure insurance through the marketplaces that are a centerpiece of the law?\nWe feel comfortable, both from talking to experts and from our years of reporting on the law, that there is no such provision. If there were, it would probably be ripe for challenge on constitutional grounds.\nIn fact, when we asked experts for their reaction to this claim, their responses included words such as \"outrageous,\" \"ridiculous\" and \"ludicrous.\"\n\"Of course there's nothing in the law that would bar any doctor from seeing any patient,\" said Katherine Baicker, a health economist at the Harvard School of Public Health.\nSo, no dice on the literal reading of her claim.\nStill, we wondered whether there was some other tiny, buried grain of truth in what Coulter claimed.

{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Tim Kaine Says former Sen. George Allen voted four times to raise his own pay.", "evidence": "Republican U.S. Senate candidate George Allen said in a recent debate that he\u2019s always opposed \"wasteful spending\" in Washington.\n\nThat drew a rebuke from Democratic opponent, Tim Kaine, who said Allen was a big spender when the Republican served in the Senate from January 2001 to January 2007. Kaine charged that Allen was even a beneficiary of his own Senate votes.\n\n\"You voted four times to raise your own pay,\" Kaine said.\n\nWe looked into Kaine\u2019s charge, made at a July 21 debate in Hot Springs.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution requires Congress to set its own pay. In 1789, members were paid $6 a day at the 1st Congress. Today, they receive $174,000 annually.\n\nCongress, no doubt, is sensitive to the political fallout that comes when it increases its pay. So in 1989, it approved legislation that would allow salaries to increase every year without requiring members to record a vote, as our colleagues at PolitiFact Florida have noted.\n\nCongress, that year, passed an ethics reform law that included an annual cost of living adjustment. The programmed raise was created in exchange for members not getting paid any longer for private speeches. The pay increase, based on a formula, became automatic unless Congress took a vote to stop it.\n\nDuring Allen\u2019s senate term, congressional salaries rose from $145,000 in January 2001 to $165,200 in January 2007. Adjusted for inflation, the level of pay stayed declined slightly.\n\nAllen never supported a bill specifically crafted to increase congressional pay.\n\nSo how does Kaine back up his claim that Allen voted four times to raise his salary?\n\nNot with votes to raise congressional salaries, as Kaine charged, but with votes Allen cast in the Senate against measures that would have prevented the the automatic raises from going into effect. This happened in three of the instances Kaine cites:\n\n*On Dec. 7, 2001, Allen voted that an amendment to prevent the annual raise from going into effect in the 2002 fiscal year was \"not germane\" to a defense appropriations bill pending in Senate. The amendment was defeated.\n\n*On Nov. 13, 2002, Allen voted against an unsuccessful amendment to the Homeland Security Act that would have prevented the annual raise from going into effect in fiscal 2003.\n\n*On Oct. 23, 2003, Allen voted against an unsuccessful amendment to the transportation and treasury appropriations bill, that called for stopping the annual raise for fiscal 2004.\n\nThe fourth incident Kaine cites also occurred on Oct. 23, 2003, when Allen voted for the overall transportation and treasury appropriation bill that contained the congressional pay hike. The cost of the salary increase -- about $2 million -- came to just 1/450th of 1 percent of the $90 billion appropriations bill.\n\nWe contacted the Allen campaign but did not receive a response that pertained to the pay raises.\n\n"}

Obama announced that day U.S. forces would leave the country by the end of the year, which they did on Dec. 15.\n\nRight away, there is a difference between what Rubio said and what WrongWayRubio.com implied. What we found didn\u2019t seem to support the tweet\u2019s claim.\n\n\"Here's my fear,\" Rubio told acting host Trace Gallagher, \"my fear is that if the pull out happens too fast, Iran and their surrogates are going to come in there and take over and start exerting influence and creating havoc for us.\"\n\nRubio was speaking there in hypothetical and not declarative terms.

But he has used Iraq and the Middle East as examples of a region requiring stronger American involvement.\n\n\"It has been suggested that the advice of military commanders in Iraq be completely ignored in favor of a dramatic troop drawdown that even Iraqis say is too drastic,\" Rubio said in a speech in Wingate, N.C., on Sept. 13, 2011.\n\nHe chided some of his contemporaries as doing only what is \"politically self-serving,\" and not in the best interests of the country. \"America, and the entire world for that matter, needs resolute leadership in this era of historic but volatile transformation, particularly in the Middle East and particularly in Iraq.\"\n\nMilitary involvement in foreign affairs has been a recurring theme in his speeches -- he mentioned the necessity of intervention in Egypt, Libya and Afghanistan, saying about the latter, \"even the slightest impression that the U.S. is looking to get out is devastating.\"\n\nWe also found a more specific statement Rubio about Iraq. On Oct. 21, 2011 -- the same day as Rubio's Studio B appearance -- Rubio issued an official statement expressing disappointment in the drawdown Obama had just announced.\n\n\"I am disappointed that U.S. and Iraqi governments could not agree on a framework that would have allowed several thousand U.S. troops to stay in Iraq to combat Al Qaeda in Iraq and continue the training mission that is vital to Iraq\u2019s future,\" he said in the statement. \"I urge the Administration not to allow today\u2019s announcement to become an obstacle to further negotiations on an enduring security relationship with Iraq.

The SHAPE Partnership is a public-private partnership that includes several state agencies.\n\nConsidering these austere times for Georgia families and state government, we thought it worthwhile to dig deeper into the $2.4 billion estimate.\n\nDeal\u2019s office sent us a 2009 report on obesity in Georgia to back up the governor\u2019s point. It mentioned that obesity costs the Peach State about $2.4 billion a year. However, that did not specify children. The report mentioned that the average cost in medical care for the obese is $250 a year.\n\nWe called the authors of that report. One of them, Justin Trogdon, said the average annual medical cost for children is $200. He did not have a specific total for how many obese children there are in Georgia. Trogdon said the $200 estimate comes from examining annual medical spending for obese people and comparing it with non-obese people. The estimate includes out-of-pocket costs and other expenses.\n\nThe annual cost for children is less than adults because they face fewer health problems, said Trogdon, a research economist at RTI International, an institute that does studies on topics that include health, education, the environment and technology for businesses and governments in more than 40 countries. Researchers are noticing more cases of high blood pressure and Type 2 diabetes among children, Trogdon said.\n\n\"A lot of the expensive issues don\u2019t manifest until later in life,\" Trogdon said.\n\nNearly 22 percent of Georgia\u2019s children between the ages of 10 and 17 are obese, according to one study sent to us by Deal\u2019s office.

That leaves us with about 2.4 million Georgians younger than 18.\n\nWe did some more math using that census estimate to determine the percentage of children considered obese and the $200 annual medical cost estimate to see how close that came to what the governor told those students. The total was about $110 million. Not close to $2.4 billion.\n\nWas our estimate wrong? We talked about it with Deal\u2019s office.

{"label": "false", "claim": "Chris Christie \"Only the State of New York spends more money on Medicaid than the State of New Jersey.\"", "evidence": "Gov. Chris Christie likes to tell people how New Jersey leads the nation or comes close in various fiscal categories, but when it comes to Medicaid spending, the Republican issued the wrong diagnosis.\n\nDuring the June 16 broadcast of On the Line, host Steve Adubato was pressing Christie about why the governor wouldn\u2019t support a tax increase for higher income earners. Adubato argued that revenue could support health benefits for struggling families.\n\nChristie said New Jersey already faces high taxes and offered this extra dose of reasoning:\n\n\"We have the second-richest Medicaid program in America. Only the State of New York spends more money on Medicaid than the State of New Jersey. Steve, at some point, we have to say no to certain things.\"\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey found that New Jersey\u2019s Medicaid expenses in recent years were higher than most of the country, but not as high as Christie said they were.\n\nAccording to three separate analyses -- covering the current federal fiscal year and the two previous ones -- New Jersey has ranked ninth each time in overall state spending on Medicaid. A Christie spokesman later pointed to older fiscal year numbers to back up the governor\u2019s statement.\n\nBased on data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, two analyses were performed by PolitiFact New Jersey and the other by the California-based Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a group that analyzes health care policy.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s start with the older numbers.\n\nAccording to the foundation\u2019s website -- www.statehealthfacts.org-- the state share of Medicaid spending in New Jersey between October 2008 and September 2009 was about $3.9 billion, putting it in ninth place among the 50 states and Washington, D.C.\n\nA similar result turned up when we looked at more recent numbers.\n\nTony Salters, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, provided us with data on Medicaid expenses from fiscal year 2010 as well as the first two quarters of fiscal year 2011.\n\nBased on that data, New Jersey ranked ninth among the states for overall state spending on Medicaid between October 2009 and September 2010. For the first two quarters of the current fiscal year, New Jersey also ranked ninth among the states, according to the federal data.\n\nIn each of the three fiscal years, the states ahead of New Jersey were New York, California, Texas, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Florida, Massachusetts and Ohio, according to the federal data.\n\nIf we go further back and look at a different measure, New Jersey still doesn\u2019t rank second.\n\nJoel Cantor, director of the Center for State Health Policy at Rutgers University, said he prefers the measure of total Medicaid spending per person below the federal poverty level. Based on that measure, New Jersey ranked 13th out of the 50 states and Washington, D.C. in federal and state spending combined in federal fiscal year 2008, Cantor said.\n\nAfter being presented with some of our findings, Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak pointed to a different analysis performed by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThat analysis shows that New Jersey ranked second among the states behind Alaska in Medicaid payments per adult in federal fiscal year 2007. Those payments represent federal and state shares.\n\n\"Of course, who we are second to is less relevant than the essential point that this is one more area where New Jersey ranked near the top in something (like taxes), and not in a good way,\" Drewniak wrote in an email.\n\nBut Medicaid payments for adults accounted for about 8 percent of total payments in New Jersey in federal fiscal year 2007, marking the smallest percentage among four enrollment groups, according to the foundation.\n\nWhen we look at per-person payments for elderly and disabled residents -- the two largest groups benefiting from Medicaid funding -- New Jersey ranked 16th and fifth, respectively, among the 50 states and Washington, D.C., according to the foundation.\n\nLet\u2019s review:\n\nIn discussing his opposition to raising taxes on higher income earners, Christie said, \"Only the State of New York spends more money on Medicaid than the State of New Jersey.\"\n\nYet federal data going back nearly three years has shown that New Jersey consistently ranks ninth in overall state spending on Medicaid. A Christie spokesman said New Jersey ranked second behind Alaska in payments per adult, but the least amount of Medicaid payments went towards that enrollment group.\n\nNew Jersey lands in the top ten for Medicaid spending in many cases, but the governor was wrong in his specific assertion that New Jersey ranked second"}
{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Austin Scott Jim Marshall \"votes liberal in Washington ... and we aren't fooled.\"", "evidence": "Austin Scott has issued some fightin' words to his opponent, U.S. Rep. Jim Marshall (D-Ga.), in the race for Georgia's 8th Congressional District.\n\nScott, a Republican, told supporters in an e-mail that Marshall \"votes liberal ... and we aren't fooled.\"\n\n\"It's one of the worst things you can say about a candidate in Georgia,\" said University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock.\n\nParticularly in the central part of the state, where Marshall has won races by razor-thin margins. In 2006, for example, Marshall won by 1 percent of all ballots cast. Bullock expects another close race this year that could help shape the balance of power between Democrats and Republicans in Congress.\n\n\"It should be our most interesting race in Georgia,\" Bullock said.\n\nThe 8th District runs along a stretch of I-75 in Middle Georgia that includes Macon, Warner Robins, Dublin and Tifton. Republicans want this seat. Badly. In 2004, Vice President Dick Cheney came to Georgia to help raise money for Marshall's opponent, Calder Clay. Two years later, President George W. Bush made a campaign stop in the area to aid Marshall's opponent, Mac Collins. It's often one of the most contested congressional seats in the nation.\n\nMarshall, first voted into office in 2002, has been able to hold on to the seat with a coalition of moderate white voters and strong support among black voters, who make up about 30 percent of the district's registered voters, Bullock said. Republicans are eager to take control of Congress, believing they can seize upon voter anger about the economy, immigration and health care legislation. Marshall, a four-term congressman, voted against the federal health care legislation earlier this year. He supported giving the Bush administration authority to invade Iraq. Marshall describes himself on his congressional Web site as one of the \"few centrists in Congress.\"\n\nScott told PolitiFact Georgia he's right in calling out Marshall's voting record. Scott said Marshall \"repeatedly voted for San Francisco liberal\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and voted for bailouts for Wall Street.\n\n\"In Middle Georgia, that's what we call liberal,\" Scott said in an e-mail.\n\nMarshall voted in October 2008 for the $700 billion financial bailout plan, but he voted against a bailout plan for the auto industry in December 2008 and a $410 billion spending plan in February. The House of Representatives elected Pelosi its speaker at the beginning of 2007 and 2009 in what are largely procedural votes along party lines. Marshall voted for Pelosi, along with fellow Democrats, said his spokesman, Douglas Moore.\n\nSo does Marshall vote liberal?\n\n\"Only if you are looking at it from the far right,\" Bullock said.\n\nIn 2009, Marshall was the 250th-most-liberal member out of the 431 House of Representatives members rated by the National Journal, which compiles an annual ranking of Congress. The rankings are based on House members' voting histories. He was the fifth-most-conservative House Democrat last year, the Journal concluded. In 2008, Marshall was the 234th-most-liberal member of the 428 House members it rated that year, the Journal found. He was the second-most-conservative Democrat that year, the Journal concluded. In 2007, Marshall was rated by the National Journal as the most conservative voting Democrat in the House.\n\nMarshall voted with Democratic colleagues about 89 percent of the time during the current Congress, according to a Washington Post analysis. That is slightly below the 92.3 percent average of most Democrats, according to the Post. Using his voting record, the Web site On the Issues rated Marshall as a \"conservative-leaning populist.\" Two groups well-regarded by conservatives, the National Rifle Association and the Family Research Council, gave Marshall high marks based on his voting record. Some left-leaning groups have also given Marshall high marks for his positions on issues important to them. The NAACP last year gave Marshall an 80 rating on a scale of 100, according to Project Vote Smart. The AFL-CIO gave him a 71 score on a scale of 100, Project Vote Smart said.\n\n\"[Marshall] has one of the most conservative Democratic voting records in Congress,\" Bullock said. \"But most Republicans are further right. Would Austin Scott be more conservative than Jim Marshall? Absolutely!\"\n\nTom Crawford, who has covered Georgia politics for more than three decades, disagreed. Crawford said on his Georgia Report blog that Marshall is \"more conservative than Scott on some issues.\"\n\nBullock believes the key for Scott will be whether he can convince voters the Marshall is a liberal. The professor remembers when Republicans labeled Democrat Zell Miller, a former U.S. senator and Georgia governor, a liberal. Miller, you may remember, endorsed George W. Bush for president in 2004 and gave the keynote address at that year's Republican National Convention.\n\nSo back to the question as to whether Marshall votes liberal?\n\nMarshall is largely rated in the middle by most political observers, based on his voting record. Some conservatives believe he's too far to the left. So where does that leave Marshall? We believe in the middle. The independent research shows Marshall votes more \"conservative\" than nearly every Democrat but more \"liberal\" than nearly every Republican"}

{"label": "pants-fire", "claim": "Patrick Johnston Says abortion is \"the most common surgery in our country.\"", "evidence": "Nearly four decades after the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade case legalized abortion, it remains an emotionally-charged debate.\n\nIt was against that backdrop that Dr. Patrick Johnston, the director of Personhood Ohio and a \u00a0leader of the effort to get the so-called \"Personhood\" issue on the Ohio ballot, began his remarks on Cleveland public radio on Jan. 30 with a statement.\n\nAt the outset of his remarks, Johnston referred to abortion as \"the most common surgery in our country.\"\n\nThe statement became the launching point for the Zanesville-area doctor to make his case that abortions have become too routine and for why Ohioans should back a rewriting of the Ohio Constitution so that a fertilized egg is defined as a person -- a change that effectively would outlaw abortion.\n\nJohnston\u2019s claim seemed like the kind of straightforward assertion that Politifact Ohio can dig into while steering clear of the moral questions that surround the divisive issue.\n\nWe began by checking with Johnston to see where he got his numbers on abortion, and the frequency of other procedures. He directed us to the website for the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research and policy analysis group, as the source for his abortion numbers\u2014they count about 1.21 million abortions in 2008.\n\nHe also pointed us to several websites for gall bladder surgery, which assert that the procedure is one of the most common surgeries in the United States with about 500,000 patients a year.\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute numbers for abortions were much higher than those we found from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which reported about 828,000 abortions in 2007. However, the CDC numbers are based on reports from state health departments and do not include abortions done in California, Maryland and New Hampshire \u2014 three states where the reporting of abortions is apparently voluntary.\n\nRebecca Wind, a spokeswoman with the Guttmacher Institute, said her group\u2019s numbers include all 50 states and are based on actively surveying abortion providers rather than pulling data from state health department reports.\n\nOver the past several years, the Guttmacher Institute\u2019s estimated number of abortions in the United States have basically held steady going from 1,206,200 in 2005 to 1,212,350 in 2008.\n\nBut are there more common forms of surgery?\n\nThe federal CDC keeps close tabs on what people are discharged from hospitals for based on a pair of national annual surveys, one for inpatient and one for outpatient clients.\n\nBy far, the most common form of surgery in 2006 was eye surgery for cataracts. There were about 5.63 million eye surgeries that involved either removing or replacing the eye lens, according to the 2006 National Survey of Ambulatory Surgery (the latest outpatient survey available).\n\nThere were about 1.4 million endoscopic polypectomies, which involves the removal of presumed pre-cancerous lesions such as polyps on the colon, according to the outpatient numbers.\n\nMeanwhile, there were about 1.34 million Caesarean sections where the fetus is delivered by cutting open the pregnant woman\u2019s abdomen, according to the 2007 National Hospital Discharge Survey (the latest inpatient survey available). Abortion would rank fourth behind that trio in most common surgeries.\n\nBut are they all examples of surgery or could they be considered just medical procedures?\n\nWe spoke with Dr. Lisa Keder, an obstetrician and associate professor with the Ohio State University Medical Center, and she said that while the term surgery isn\u2019t strictly defined, the way that patients are billed for medical procedures reflects whether it is officially considered \"surgery.\"\n\nKeder said that eye operations, endoscopic polypectomies, C-sections and abortions are all coded for billing purposes as surgeries. \u00a0\n\nAdditionally, we should note here that because so many people go to the hospital for medical procedures -- almost 45 million inpatient procedures were done on 34.4 million people in 2007 in the United States -- that virtually every type of surgery on a human system when classified broadly was much more common than abortions.\n\nThere were, for example, 6.94 million heart operations, but no specific procedure more than the 1.06 million cardiac catheterizations. So if you classify surgeries in broad terms, abortions tumble much farther than No. 4 on the most common surgeries list.\n\nJohnston , while trying to make his case that abortion has become too routine, told a Cleveland radio audience that abortion was \"the most common surgery in this country.\"\n\nHe\u2019s not even close.\n\nThe most comprehensive abortions statistics show about 1.21 million abortions a year in the United States. But annual surveys show there are about 5.63 million eye surgeries involving the removal or replacement of the lens in the eye. That procedure occurs more than four times as often as abortion.\n\nAnd abortion didn\u2019t rank No. 2 or No. 3.\n\nThere were about 1.4 million cases where presumed per-cancerous polyps were removed from inside a patient\u2019s body the year of the most recent outpatient survey numbers available.\n\nMeanwhile, a procedure that is common among women who are giving birth -- a Caesarean section -- occured more frequently that year than did abortion"}

But it mirrored many statements that came in the wake of the Feb. 26, 2020 shooting at the Miller brewery complex in Milwaukee.\u00a0\nAnd it remains somewhat of a timeless talking point.\u00a0\nIn the release, Taylor said she vividly remembered the day the Sandy Hook shooting took place, as her son was in first grade at the time. She then said that Republican lawmakers are no closer to enacting legislation that would protect children from gun violence now than they were then.\u00a0\nWe asked Taylor for backup, her staff sent back information on the laws and regulations surrounding gun ownership, dog ownership and voting in Wisconsin.\u00a0\nSo we\u2019ll start there.\u00a0\nIs it easier to get a gun than to adopt a four-legged friend or register to vote?\u00a0\nGetting a gun\nPolitiFact Wisconsin has previously written about gun sales in Wisconsin, and how purchases through a licensed dealer are different from purchases from a private seller.\u00a0\nIf someone buys a gun from a licensed dealer, they must undergo a background check. For handguns, that check is run by the state Department of Justice. For long guns -- such as rifles or shotguns -- the check is through the National Criminal Background Check System.\u00a0\nUnder state law, the buyer must show photo identification to the seller. Then he or she must fill out three copies of DOJ-issued documents, one for the seller, one for the buyer and one that is\u00a0 sent to the DOJ after the purchase.\u00a0\nAfter the forms are completed, the seller contacts the DOJ, which charges $10 to run the check, or the National Criminal Check System. If the check turns up clear, the buyer can leave the store with the gun.\u00a0\nIn 2019, some 294,999 guns were purchased from a licensed dealer in Wisconsin, according to Gillian Drummond, DOJ communications director. The department does not, however, track how many guns are sold in Wisconsin from non-licensed dealers, she said in an email.\u00a0\nPrivate gun sales work a bit differently.\u00a0\nThey\u2019re not regulated by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, according to the agency\u2019s website. Wisconsin doesn\u2019t regulate private sales, either, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a group that advocates tighter restrictions on gun ownership.\u00a0\nPrivate sales can also be conducted through web sites such as Armslist or even Craigslist, taking out the process of a background check completely.\u00a0\nSo, circling back to Taylors claim: While many gun sales require a background check, private purchases can be made with little or no scrutiny at all.\u00a0\n\n"}

Betty Sutton after the Democrat from Copley Township, near Akron, Ohio, announced she\u2019ll run next year against GOP Rep. Jim Renacci.\n\nThe day after Sutton\u2019s announcement Dec. 7, the campaign arm for Republicans in the House of Representatives issued a news release that accused Sutton and dozens of other targeted Democrats of opposing \"efforts to prevent job-killing regulations that hurt America's farmers.\"\n\nNext it launched a web ad that attacked Sutton over the Obama administration\u2019s decision to postpone action on construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline.\n\nThen, on Dec. 13, it produced a news release that blasted Sutton for opposing a GOP bill that tied a payroll tax cut extension sought by Democrats with a host of GOP priorities. The bill, titled the \"Middle Class Tax Relief & Job Creation Act,\" included an accelerated review of the oil pipeline, restrictions on unemployment benefits, reforms to the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program, an extended pay freeze for federal workers including Congress members, provisions to defund health care reforms and restrictions on the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nBefore the vote, President Barack Obama said he wouldn\u2019t accept a measure that tied the payroll tax cuts to \"a whole bunch of extraneous issues.\" Leaders of the Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate said it would die there after it passed the House. And in fact, the Senate approved different legislation with bipartisan support to temporarily extend the payroll tax cut.\n\nThe GOP press release maintained Sutton\u2019s vote against the measure constituted her support for a tax increase on middle class families, giving herself a pay raise, and allowing \"welfare fund withdrawals from strip clubs, casinos and liquor stores.\"\n\nAny of these claims might provide fodder for examination by PolitiFact Ohio, but we were particularly curious about the group\u2019s charge that Sutton supports withdrawal of welfare money from adult entertainment facilities.\n\nWe asked NRCC spokeswoman Andrea Bozek where it came from. She said that many state welfare recipients use benefit transfer cards to withdraw their money from automatic teller machines. Although the money is supposed to be used to meet their subsistence needs, several investigative reports have found the money is sometimes withdrawn from ATMs located in places \u00a0where gambling and adult-oriented activities take place. That has prompted several legislators to introduce measures to crack down on the practice, one of which was included in the larger bill that Sutton voted against.\n\n\"There\u2019s no reason why welfare recipients should be gambling away our taxpayer dollars at strip clubs or casinos instead of feeding their families and finding a good job,\" said Bozek, contending that Sutton voted to \"continue this abuse of taxpayer funds.\"\n\nSutton spokesman Anthony DeAngelo said Sutton supports extending the payroll tax cuts as well as banning welfare money withdrawals at adult-oriented establishments, but voted against the December 13 bill because she opposed some of the other provisions it contained.\n\nSutton herself noted that she backed a separate bill the House of Representatives adopted without opposition on December 15 which imposed the welfare money restrictions as it extended the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program. The measure was considered so non-controversial that it was approved on a \"voice vote\" that did not record the \"yeas\" or \"nays\" of individual members.\n\nThere is an element of truth in the the NRCC\u2019s claim. Sutton, along with 178 other Democrats and 14 Republicans, did oppose the House bill.\n\nBut it ignores critical facts that would give the listener a different impression. Namely, there\u2019s a world of difference between opposing a bill laden with partisan provisions and supporting, as the NRCC says, \"welfare fund withdrawals from strip clubs, casinos and liquor stores.\"\n\nAnd the subsequent bipartisan support for the same welfare reforms just underscores that point"}

Across the 20 states that report votes by party registration, when it came to in-person voting, Republicans led by a 42% to 36% margin in November\u2019s election (with 22% listing no affiliation), while Democrats had a 48% to 27% edge in mail-in balloting (with 25% listing no affiliation), according to the U.S. Elections Project.\u00a0\nSo a key part of understanding why early and late returns differ is looking at where those votes came from and how they were cast. This claim ignores that question altogether to treat each vote as if it were a coin flip.\nKenneth Mayer, professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin Madison, said Cicchetti\u2019s approach is \"ludicrous.\"\n\"The analysis assumes that votes are all independently and randomly distributed,\" he said in an email. \"This is going to be used in undergraduate statistics classes as a canonical example of how not to do statistics.\"\nAbsentee ballots change everything\nThe observed party split by voting method is key to understanding the absurdity of this claim.\nCicchetti\u2019s defense \u2014 in a description of his methodology attached to the lawsuit \u2014 focuses primarily on Georgia, noting Trump was leading 51% to 49% at 3 a.m. on Nov. 4 but wound up narrowly losing the state.\n\"The Georgia reversal in the outcome raises questions because the votes tabulated in the two time periods could not be random samples from the same population of votes cast,\" Cicchetti says.\nHe\u2019s so close to getting it right, but ends up so very wrong.\n\n"}

Attacked early on for raising taxes more than he cut them, Huckabee began laying the tax increases off on others. There was, for example, that matter of the 3-cent increase in the gas tax in Arkansas in 1999 accompanied by a 4-cent increase in the diesel tax, which is paid mostly by truckers.\n\n\"You know what we did?\" he said to George Stephanopoulos of ABC News last Feb. 11, 2007. \"We put it on the ballot, and 80 percent of the people of Arkansas voted for the fuel taxes because they wanted better roads.\"\n\n\nThe voters voted all right \u2013 but not on the taxes. Instead, voters approved (by 80 percent) a $575-million bond issue that would be supported by the diesel tax and future federal highway funds. The diesel tax and the gasoline tax were going to take effect regardless of how the public voted.\n\n\nThe Arkansas legislature had approved those taxes on April 1, 1999, and the first penny of the gas tax and the first 2 cents of diesel tax were already in effect on June 15, when voters went to the polls that year. (The gas tax rose by a penny each of the next two years, the diesel tax by 2 cents the next year.)\n\n\nThe taxes and the bonds were a package plan, and Huckabee was its strong advocate. The plan to sell bonds was in Act 1027, approved by the legislature the same day as the gas tax in Act 1028.\n\n\nHuckabee would be fully justified in arguing that the vote reflected support for the taxes that supported the plan to issue bonds.\n\n\nIn fact, he could even argue that the voters were approving the massive additional spending on roads. If the federal grants and diesel tax weren't enough to repay the bonds, the \"full faith and credit\" of the state stood behind them.

{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Ezekiel Emanuel It's a good sign for Obamacare that in California, \"the proportion of kids who are signing up is the proportion of kids in the population.\"", "evidence": "Health policy experts are eyeing one group of Americans very carefully as people sign up for health coverage on insurance exchanges: young adults.\nParticipation by this age group is seen as crucial to the success of the insurance marketplaces. Young adults are generally in better health and are needed to balance out risk among other, older enrollees, and they\u2019re disproportionately uninsured.\nOn NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday, host David Gregory asked if \"the lag effect\" of the struggling federal marketplace will deter young adults from signing up for insurance.\nWashington Post Wonkblog editor Ezra Klein said the Obama administration was planning to deploy a vast marketing campaign to encourage young people to sign up through their preferred TV shows, social networks and parents, but the effort was not fully rolled out as problems with Healthcare.gov persisted.\nDr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a bioethicist and former health care adviser in the Obama administration, pointed to a microcosm of success in California, where the state-based exchange is \"working well enough.\"\n\"And there, the proportion of kids who are signing up is the proportion of kids in the population,\" Emanuel said. \"And so it does appear that we are going to have enough when you look at that data point. And if we can get the word out, I think Ezra is right, we'll get enough young people.\"\nCalifornia\u2019s enrollment figures were described as \"a rare bright spot\" by the New York Times amid dismal reports about the federal marketplace. We wanted to dig in a little more and find out if Emanuel is right that young adults are signing up as a proportion to the population in California.\nSeveral experts we reached were initially thrown by Emanuel\u2019s use of \"kids.\" Emanuel clarified he was referring to news about young adult sign-ups from Covered California, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, in a brief interview. (He added that he has an almost 30-year-old \"kid.\")\nCovered California, the state's insurance marketplace, distributed a Nov. 21 press release that pointed out 18- to 34-year-olds applied \"in direct proportion to California\u2019s population\" in October.\nThat age group comprised about 22.5 percent, or about 6,900, of the people who selected plans during October and were not eligible for Medicaid. In 2010, the same group comprised about 21 percent of the state\u2019s population. The last two columns from the following Covered California chart illustrate the\u00a0point.\nThe gap widens if you tinker with different data. Young adults comprise 25 percent of the state\u2019s population using 2012 data from the American Community Survey, and about 27\u00a0percent if you take out the 65-and-over population, which is eligible for\u00a0Medicare, according to the California Health Interview Survey 2011-12 data.\nSo, we\u2019re all finished here, right? Well, hold on.\nFor one thing, experts said it\u2019s way too early to draw sweeping conclusions from the state\u2019s first month of data. November data, unavailable until mid December, could tell a very different tale. The real meaningful test will be how many young adults sign up long-term.\n\"People talk about these numbers because we have them, but you can't extrapolate from these,\" said Glenn Melnick, a University of Southern California health policy professor.\nThen there\u2019s another matter of Covered California, and Emanuel, spinning the data in a way that emits positivity but, experts say, is not exactly relevant.\nInstead of comparing the percentage of young adult enrollees to their share of the population, some said it would be better to compare those signups to young adults\u2019 share of the uninsured population, which is about 40 percent, several experts said.\n\"They need it proportionate to the target population, which is the uninsured,\" Melnick said.\nAnother issue with comparing to a share of the population: The marketplaces established by the health care law are not really intended for the nation\u2019s youngest and oldest residents. Children who receive coverage because of the law are getting it mainly through expanded Medicaid offerings, and adults over 65 are eligible for Medicare. That means comparisons could be misleading.\n\n"}

Bruce Starr is fending off an aggressive challenge from Rep. Chuck Riley. Starr is a Republican finishing his second term in the Senate, District 15; Riley is a Democrat completing his third term in the House, District 29.\n\nRiley has made a big to-do over Starr\u2019s ethics, highlighting the fact that he accepted a free trip to Maui to attend a beer and wine distributors\u2019 conference in 2002. Riley\u2019s campaign also filed a complaint with the Oregon secretary of state\u2019s office, which is still under review, alleging that Starr had claimed too much in mileage reimbursement. \u00a0\n\nFor his part, Starr released an ad featuring retired Navy Capt. Greg Wooldridge attesting to the senator\u2019s high ethical standards.\n\nBut what caught our attention in the TV spot was this claim, spoken by the announcer: \"Bruce Starr was the only senator to vote for stronger ethics laws and greater accountability.\" A copy of Senate Bill 30 from the 2009 legislative session appears onscreen, implying that was the bill Starr voted for.\n\nThe only senator? Was Starr the only yes vote on SB 30? And if the bill was so ethically swell, why didn\u2019t the other senators vote yes, too?\n\nBut wait: Starr didn\u2019t vote for Senate Bill 30 at all. He voted against it.\n\nPolitiFact Oregon is as confused as you are. Let\u2019s back up.\n\nIn late 2006 The Oregonian wrote about a number of legislators who failed to report free trips to Hawaii courtesy of the Oregon Beer and Wine Distributors Association. In response, lawmakers in 2007 approved Senate Bill 10, prohibiting public officials from accepting out-of-state trips, entertainment and fancy meals from lobbyists. The bill expanded which public officials had to report their finances and increased how often they and lobbyists had to file -- from once a year to four times a year. It became law.\n\nThen the complaints started. Rural volunteer commissioners quit en masse, calling the disclosure forms onerous and invasive. The disclosure forms also asked for the names of all family members. And nobody liked reporting four times a year when they had nothing new to report.\n\nThe 2009 Legislature hustled to tweak the law. In the end, Senate Bill 30 allowed limited entertainment and kept a cap on gifts and entertainment to $50 from a single source in a year. Disclosure reports were cut back to every year. More public officials were required to report. It passed.\n\nStarr\u2019s was the only no vote in the Senate, as well as in the House, on final passage. He offered no explanation at the time and says now he can\u2019t remember if he offered one anywhere else. In an interview this week, he said he voted against SB 30 because he wanted to maintain the more frequent reporting requirements of Senate Bill 10 for legislators.\n\n\"The issue I was most concerned about was rolling back the fact that legislators didn\u2019t have to report quarterly,\" he said. \" ... If they had separated the issues, I likely would have voted for SB 30.\"\n\nStarr is correct on that one, narrow issue. More often is better when it comes to disclosure. But to say he was the only senator to vote for stronger ethics laws is wrong. Both Senate bills 10 and 30 sharply curtailed entertainment, meals and trips offered by lobbyists and strengthened Oregon\u2019s ethics laws, and many senators voted in favor of the stricter rules"}

The evidence clearly points to Ukraine\u2019s Russian separatists, who have already shot down 12 Ukrainian military planes, he said.\nKerry\u2019s cache of evidence included a flow of major weapons (including tanks and rocket launchers) from Russia to the rebels over the past month. And he says the Russians trained the rebels to use an SA-11 missile launcher like the one used to shoot down MH 17. Additionally, an SA-11 passed through the area where the launch originated in the past couple of days, but it did not belong to Ukraine.\nTo top it off, the separatists have implicated themselves, Kerry claimed.

He is a veteran of the Russian military, having fought in post-Soviet conflicts in Transnistria, Serbia and Chechnya, according to the New York Times. Kiev leadership believes Strelkov currently works for Russian military intelligence -- taken by some as proof of Russia\u2019s assistance in the separatist uprising, according to BBC reports.\nStrelkov last legally crossed into Ukraine from Russia on Feb. 26 of this year. In an interview with the\u00a0Russian tabloid\u00a0Komsomolskaya Pravda, he admitted to participating in the conflicts in Crimea in the spring and in Slovyansk in April.

{"label": "true", "claim": "Florida Democratic Party \"(Bill) McCollum also voted for numerous amendments to weaken the legislation, even voting to make trains less accessible to those in wheelchairs.\"", "evidence": "Gubernatorial hopeful Bill McCollum has been in politics for much of his adult life, charting a wide map of potential minefields for his enemies to use against him.\n\nThe Florida Democratic Party, no stranger to partisan warfare, took such aim in a July 26, 2010, press release, using the 20th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act to remind voters of McCollum's initial concerns about the sweeping civil rights legislation.\n\n\"Earlier this year, McCollum said he was proud of his efforts to pass the ADA when he was in Congress, noting there was 'Great Resistance' to the bill. McCollum neglected to state that he was a major player in the 'Great Resistance,' \" wrote party spokesman Eric Jotkoff in the press release.\n\nThe press release goes on, \"He urged then-President George H.W. Bush to reconsider his support of the ADA ... McCollum also voted for numerous amendments to weaken the legislation, even voting to make trains less accessible to those in wheelchairs. McCollum then voted for final passage of the ADA, saying 'politically, it's a very tough vote.' \"\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act, signed into law July 26, 1990, is considered one of the nation's most important civil rights victories. It requires that disabled Americans be provided reasonable access to employment, transportation, public buildings and communications services. It is widely supported by Republicans and Democrats alike, although some conservatives, libertarians and business groups have long expressed concern that the law puts an undue burden on public servants and employers to accommodate the disabled.\n\nThe Democrats' claim that McCollum, who represented Florida in Congress for two decades, tried to water down the legislation and didn't want to help people in wheelchairs is an emotional charge. We wondered, is it true?\n\nIn fact, congressional records show McCollum voted for several amendments to the bill.\n\nHe supported Amendment 448, which would have specified that the costs required to accommodate the employment of a disabled person not exceed 10 percent of the annual salary or the annualized hourly wage of that job. In debate, McCollum said the amendment, \"may be the most significant one from the standpoint of mitigating the cost to small business.\" It failed 187-213 on May 17, 1990. \"Today, we are going to say that a company manager who earns $40,000 is entitled to a greater accommodation that the mail clerk who receives a salary of $15,000?\" argued Rep. Dwayne Payne, D-N.J., according to congressional records.\n\nOn May 22, 1990, the day the legislation passed in the House, records show McCollum voted for Amendment 452, which sought to exempt commuter rail services from the requirement that all new rail cars be readily accessible by persons with disabilities if the commuter rail service made at least one car per train accessible for the disabled. To qualify for the exemption, a rail service would have to add more accessible cars if the demand could not be met by just one car. Proponents of the rail amendment argued that the change offered more specific requirements, albeit different ones, than the original bill, and therefore provided greater protection. For example, the bill required all new purchased or leased buses and rail cars be accessible to the disabled but did not require retrofitting of existing vehicles. The amendment, singled out by the Florida Democratic Party in its press release, failed 110-290. The New York Times wrote at the time, \"opponents said the effect of the proposed changes would be to segregate people with disabilities.\"\n\nMcCollum also voted for Amendment 453 that day, which sought to provide an annual exemption to public transit systems in urban areas with populations of less than 200,000 from the bill's requirement that new vehicles be accessible to people with disabilities, including wheelchair users. To qualify for the exemption, the transit system would have to develop an alternative plan, such as a Dial-a-Ride service. \"It is the people who need to get from their home to where they want to go, the people who cannot get to the bus stop, are the people who are going to suffer,\" said sponsor Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Penn. The amendment failed 148-266. \"A civil right to equal transportation services does not diminish according to a city's population in the latest census,\" said Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif., according to Congressional Quarterly.\n\nFinally, McCollum voted for Amendment 454, which sought to keep plaintiffs from suing for monetary damages by limiting the remedies available to discrimination victims to those provided under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, such as injunctive relief, back pay and attorney fees. Supporters argued the disabled should not have greater remedies than those available to women and minorities under the 1964 law. The amendment failed 192-227. \"You have lesser rights if you have lesser remedies,\" said Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., at the time, according to Congressional Quarterly.\n\nOn that amendment, McCollum argued at the time: \"The real problem I have had with the ADA bill altogether, and I am going to vote for this bill, even though a lot of people think that I am out here with a lot of amendments and I am opposed, I am not, because I think the disabled need to have a civil rights bill like this one. I think the problem we have had all along has been costs. It has been a question of how do we mitigate, how do we reduce, costs. It is far more complex under the civil rights legislation for the handicapped than it is for race or sex or any other kind of discrimination. There may be as many as 900, some people say, 900 different disabilities covered by this legislation. There are innumerable different situations in the workplace where the handicapped of different types will intermesh, and those situations will have to be resolved hopefully through processes that are short of litigation. It will be expensive, and even if there is a resolution occasionally by litigation, that will undoubtedly be a very expensive route.\"\n\nMcCollum then joined the majority to pass the legislation in a 403-20 vote.\n\nSo, would the amendments he supported have weakened the legislation? The McCollum campaign did not respond to our questions on this point.\n\nBut many experts on disability law said the amendments did attempt to undercut the bill.\n\n\"These amendments sought to narrow the rights provided to individuals with disabilities,\" said Ruth Colker, author of The Disability Pendulum: The First Decade of the Americans with Disabilities Act and a law professor at Ohio State University.\n\nThe amendments were \"more pro business and anti-worker,\" said Paul Steven Miller, a University of Washington law professor and a former commissioner on the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency that enforces employment discrimination laws. \"They sort of run counter to what the ADA seeks to accomplish.\"\n\nWe also checked whether the law was eventually altered to reflect the amendments supported by McCollum. It wasn't. To this day, Americans with disabilities can sue for monetary damages, there is no fiscal cap on how much an employer may spend to accommodate a disabled employer, and transportation systems still must be accessible.\n\nTo be sure, the Americans with Disabilities Act does have its critics.\n\nAfter the legislation's passage, the libertarian Cato Institute published a policy analysis by economist Robert O'Quinn, that concluded, \"the ADA so zealously pursues its mainstreaming goal that individuals, businesses, and governmental bodies must make expensive accommodations to ensure full integration even when less costly, more convenient alternatives, which are preferred by disabled individuals, are available.\"\n\nHe continued, \"The ADA is objectionable on moral as well as economic grounds. In a free society the government should employ its coercive powers only to protect the life, liberty, and property of its citizens from aggression. Any attempt to enforce moral behavior, however noble or desirable, is beyond the proper scope of government.\"\n\nIn contrast, some advocates of the bill have complained that it did not go far enough.\n\nOur mission, however, is not to judge the value of the acclaimed legislation.\n\nThe Florida Democratic Party claimed McCollum \"voted for numerous amendments to weaken the legislation, even voting to make trains less accessible to those in wheelchairs"}
{"label": "false", "claim": "Donald Trump \"A lot of people are talking about\" the removal of a \"very fair prosecutor\" in Ukraine.", "evidence": "President Donald Trump in a phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart repeatedly suggested that an ousted Ukrainian prosecutor enjoyed a reputation for fairness when then-vice president Joe Biden in 2015 stepped in to press for the prosecutor\u2019s removal.\u00a0\nA White House summary of a July 25 telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky shows Trump describing Ukraine\u2019s former prosecutor general Viktor Shokin as a \"very good\" and \"very fair prosecutor.\"\n\"A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved,\" Trump said, according to the readout, later adding, \"I heard the prosecutor was treated very badly and he was a very fair prosecutor.\"\nA few moments later, Trump added, \"The other thing, There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it \u2026 .\"\nWe decided to fact-check whether the Ukrainian prosecutor enjoyed the positive reputation Trump claimed. The notion that Shokin was widely seen as a \"very good\" and \"very fair prosecutor\" is inconsistent with our findings.\nShokin\u2019s reputation\nTrump\u2019s claim requires some additional context. In his phone call with Zelenksy, Trump never referred to Shokin by name. But the context of the call, including his remarks about Biden, seems to make clear that Shokin is who Trump had in mind. In fact, by the time he resigned, he was widely considered corrupt and ineffective.\nThe White House did not respond to our request for comment and for information that would support this positive view of Shokin\u2019s tenure. We also independently looked for affirmative reviews of Shokin\u2019s work and weren\u2019t able to find anything substantive or specific.\u00a0\nTrump and Zelensky discussed the possibility of reviving a dormant Ukrainian government investigation into a Ukrainian energy company that Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, served as a board member on while his father was vice president. (See our related fact-check.)\nTrump\u2019s reference to the Ukrainian prosecutor being \"shut down\" is an apparent reference to Shokin\u2019s ouster in 2016, which then-Vice President Joe Biden helped orchestrate.\u00a0\nBiden had assumed a lead role in U.S. diplomacy toward Ukraine amid a popular revolution that in early 2014 led to pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych fleeing the country. Shokin became top prosecutor\u00a0after Yanukovych went into exile. A frustrated Biden in Dec. 2015 threatened to withhold $1 billion unless Shokin\u00a0was fired. According to Biden, it worked.\u00a0\nDuring an event sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations on Jan. 23, 2018, the former vice president made the following remarks, which at points were accompanied by laughter from the audience:\n\"I remember going over (to Ukraine), convincing our team \u2026 that we should be providing for loan guarantees \u2026 And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from (then Ukrainian President Petro) Poroshenko and from (then-Prime Minister Arseniy) Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor (Shokin). And they didn\u2019t. ...\n\"They were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, ... we\u2019re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, \u2018You have no authority. You\u2019re not the president.\u2019 \u2026 I said, call him. I said, I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you\u2019re not getting the billion. ... I looked at them and said, \u2018I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money.\u2019 Well, son of a b----. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.\"\n(We\u2019ll note that this transcript shows that Trump mischaracterized Biden\u2019s remarks when he told Zelensky in their call that \"Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution\" into the company his son was involved in. Biden bragged about getting rid of an ineffective prosecutor, not stopping an investigation.)\nTrump\u2019s boasts about Shokin \u2014 that he was widely seen as a \"very good\" and \"very fair prosecutor\" \u2014\u00a0 clash with the view of many Western leaders and institutions. Largely, they were united in seeking Shokin\u2019s removal.\u00a0\nWhen Shokin was sacked on March 26, 2016, press reports explicitly linked his ouster to corruption. Here\u2019s how the New York Times described it:\nMOSCOW \u2014 Bowing to pressure from international donors, the Ukrainian Parliament voted on Tuesday to remove a prosecutor general who had clung to power for months despite visible signs of corruption.\u00a0\nIn fairness, the Times\u2019 also said experts on Ukrainian politics said Shokin \"had played an important role in balancing competing political interests, helping maintain stability during a treacherous era in the divided country\u2019s history.\"\nBut strong Western opposition to Shokin was well established prior to his ouster.\n\n"}
{"label": "mostly-true", "claim": "Steven Costantino \"He's the only candidate who's balanced budgets and brought jobs to Providence.\"", "evidence": "In the four-way Democratic primary for Providence mayor, state Rep. Steven Costantino has portrayed what some consider a liability -- his years in the General Assembly -- as a strength that separates him from the rest of the pack.\n\nHis latest TV commercials cite his experience, saying \"he\u2019s the only candidate who\u2019s balanced budgets and brought jobs to Providence.\"\n\u00a0\nWe\u2019ll take the claims one at a time, starting with the budget balancing.\n\nAs chairman of the House Finance Committee, a position he\u2019s held for seven years, Costantino is considered the legislature\u2019s chief budget writer.\n\nThe Rhode Island Constitution requires state budgets to be balanced. And on paper, when the governor presents his budget to the General Assembly and when the Assembly gives final approval to its revised version, they are.\n\nBut critics have long complained that Rhode Island's budgets are never really balanced. Too often, they're predicated on spending plans that aren't followed, or on overly optimistic assumptions that federal funding will increase or gambling revenues will grow. Almost every year, the Assembly must pass mid-year \"supplemental\" budgets to plug the holes. Then the debate continues as to whether they were ever balanced in the first place.\n\nCostantino defends the budgets he\u2019s crafted as House Finance chairman, saying they are accurate at the time they are written.\n\n\u00a0\"Every budget in the world is an assumption,\" he said. \"At the time we pass them, they are balanced.\" Yet the finance chairman is also realistic that tax-and-spend plans don\u2019t tend to stay that way for long. They are moving targets.\n\u00a0\nTechnically, he\u2019s right about all of that. But is Costantino the only candidate who has experience balancing budgets?\n\nThree of his opponents-- Democrats Angel Taveras and Christopher Young and independent Jonathan Scott -- have never held elected office, so none of them has been in a position to balance a budget.\n\u00a0\nDemocrat John Lombardi is another story. For 26 years, Lombardi has served on the City Council, including seven years as president. He also filled in briefly as mayor after Vincent A \"Buddy\" Cianci resigned in 2002.\n\nWe asked Lombardi about his experience with the city\u2019s budget, which, like the state\u2019s plan, must be balanced each year. As council president, Lombardi said\u00a0 he oversaw the council\u2019s roughly $1-million budget. Each year, he also voted on the $600-million plus\u00a0 tax-and-spend plan (sometimes in favor, sometimes against). In addition, he sent us several examples of letters he wrote to the Council Finance chairmen recommending ways to trim city expenses.\n\nThe Costantino campaign dismisses Lombardi\u2019s budget experience: \"There\u2019s a very clear difference between the person who sits at the table, rolls up his sleeves and manages a budget than the person on the City Council who simply has to take a vote,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\u00a0\nYet the fact remains that, with 26 years experience, Lombardi played at least some role, however small, in assembling spending plans.\n\nIt\u2019s fair for Costantino to say he balanced budgets. But his claim that he\u2019s the only candidate who has done so is not entirely accurate.\n\nNow on to the second claim, that he\u2019s the only candidate who brought jobs to Providence.\n\nCostantino sponsored and pushed for passage of legislation this year that allowed the Industrial Recreational Building Authority, an arm of the state's Economic Development Corporation, to guarantee up to $60 million in bank loans to help free up credit that small businesses need to hire new employees. The first $6.7-million guarantee went to Providence\u2019s CAPCO Steel, which is currently using the money to hire 100 workers, his campaign said.\n\nThe Costantino camp provided other examples --\u00a0 his roles in the Assembly\u2019s decision to purchase and renovate the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts Center -- and in legislation that helped rehabilitate the derelict Masonic Temple into a luxury hotel, to name a few.\n\nTherefore, it\u2019s accurate to say Costantino has helped bring jobs to the city.\n\nIs he the only candidate who did that? Again, Taveras, Young and Scott were not in a position to do so. But Lombardi cited several examples of how he helped bring jobs to Providence. He said he voted in favor of the tax benefits that lured the GTECH headquarters to the capital city. He also supported a variety of ordinances needed for development of the Rhode Island Convention Center. Finally, he told us he added a handful of jobs to the Providence City Council office.\n\nCostantino is correct about his own record in crafting budgets and bringing jobs to Providence, but he gets it slightly wrong when he says he\u2019s the only candidate who did so"}
{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Ron Johnson Washington politicians \"run Social Security like a Ponzi scheme.\"", "evidence": "It\u2019s not often that a key platform of Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal is compared to Bernie Madoff\u2019s $65 billion Ponzi scheme.\n\nBut 2010 is anything but a typical election year.\n\nLike numerous Republicans, U.S. Senate candidate Ron Johnson has been likening Social Security -- created 75 years ago to provide retirees with a steady income -- to a Ponzi scheme. It\u2019s an eye-catching comparison that has been made by Senate candidates Rand Paul in Kentucky and Sharon Angle in Nevada, among others.\n\nWhere does Johnson fit in?\n\nIn a move to head off criticism from his opponent, Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, Johnson put his Ponzi comparison at the center of TV and radio ads that began running Sept. 15, 2010.\n\n\"I'm going to tell you what Senator Feingold and his allies' next attack against me will be,\" Johnson says in the radio ad. \"They're going to tell you I said Washington politicians have run Social Security like a Ponzi scheme.\n\nJohnson goes on to say: \"I did say that, and it's true. During his 18 years in the Senate, Russ Feingold and politicians from both parties have raided $2 trillion from the Social Security trust fund. They spent your savings. The money is gone. And what did we get? Bigger government, wasteful spending and an IOU.\"\n\nThe television ad is similar, with Johnson instead saying \"Washington treats Social Security like a Ponzi scheme.\"\n\nA\u00a0 $2 trillion Ponzi scheme?\n\nNow that would be a big-time crime, especially since Social Security affects virtually every American. Indeed, at that size, even Madoff would be green with envy.\n\nLet\u2019s start with what the phrase \"Ponzi scheme\" means.\n\nThe scheme was named after Charles Ponzi, the Boston con man who in 1920 bilked investors out of about $10 million by promising returns of up to 100% in just 45 days. Ponzi invested little of the cash. Instead, he used it to finance his lavish lifestyle. He kept the scheme afloat by using new money to pay off older investors\n\nThink robbing Peter to pay Paul. \u00a0\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission offers a simple definition: \u00a0\"A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud that involves the payment of purported returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors.\"\n\nOn one level, that sounds like Social Security, which uses taxes on today\u2019s wage earners to fund the retirement checks of millions of Americans. But remember: The SEC also notes that a Ponzi is an \"investment fraud.\"\n\nLet\u2019s look deeper, at how Johnson applies the characterization to the Social Security system. Is he going beyond superficial similarities?\n\nHere\u2019s what Johnson said at a July 26, 2010 \u00a0luncheon sponsored by Wispolitics.com, when he was asked about the Ponzi comparison.\n\n\"What is the most famous Ponzi scheme we most recently heard of?\" Johnson asked.\n\nAudience members responded Madoff.\n\nJohnson went on to say: \u00a0\"What did Bernie Madoff \u00a0do? .... He took money in from investors. He paid some of the older investors off and he spent the rest of the money. The money was spent, it\u2019s gone.\"\n\nIn the next breath he moved on to Social Security and said: \u00a0\"You just tell me how that\u2019s different from a Ponzi scheme.\"\n\nSo, Johnson takes it beyond simply saying Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system. He\u2019s invoking Madoff\u2019s name to make his point.\n\nJohnson\u2019s campaign manager, Juston Johnson, said neither he nor his boss is \"saying the Social Security Administration is a fraud\" -- pointing out the candidate wants to fix the system. Asked why the candidate used Madoff\u2019s name, if it wasn\u2019t meant to imply criminal wrongdoing, the spokesman declined to answer.\n\nThe issue, according to Juston Johnson, is the more than $2 trillion the Senate candidate says was raided from the Social Security Trust Fund.\n\nWhile the Social Security Administration objects to politicians saying the trust fund was raided, spokeswoman Dorothy Clark said in an e-mail that \"The Social Security Trust Funds currently holds over $2.5 trillion in interest bearing Treasury securities backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government.\"\n\nIn other words, a giant IOU.\n\nThe IOU part echoes what Johnson said, but the candidate misses a huge point -- and one that undermines his own statement. A Ponzi scheme is based on a lie. There is a promise that participants will get their money back plus a whole lot more. \u00a0But the bulk of the money isn\u2019t invested -- it\u2019s generally blown by the swindler.\n\nThe IOU to the fund, on the other hand, \u00a0is backed by the full credit and faith of the U.S. government. \u00a0It must be repaid, with interest -- though doing so may cause the government to borrow even more.\n\nEugene Steuerle, a Social Security expert at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan economic and social policy research think tank, said the $2 trillion in debt came about because the Social Security system used to run a surplus -- which helped encourage bigger spending by the rest of the government.\n\nSaid Steuerle: \"To the extent that the candidate is arguing (that Social Security) is run like a Ponzi scheme, in the sense that there\u2019s really no significant savings in the system, that\u2019s right.\"\n\nTo combat the Ponzi comparisons, the Social Security Administration created a web page in 2009 that looked at Ponzi\u2019s scheme and its own operation.\n\nThe site \u00a0acknowledges \"a superficial analogy\" between a Ponzi scheme and pay-as-you-go programs such as Social Security. But, it argues the \"structure, logic, and mode of operation (of Social Security has) nothing in common with Ponzi schemes or chain letters or pyramid schemes.\"\n\nThe agency\u2019s conclusion: \"The American Social Security system has been in continuous successful operation since 1935. Charles Ponzi's scheme lasted barely 200 days.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe figured there were two people who could truly sort out the comparison.\n\nUnfortunately, Ponzi died in 1949. And the Federal Bureau of Prisons does not expect the 72-year-old Madoff to be available for public appearances until Nov. 14, 2039.\n\nSo, we went to the next best person -- Mitchell Zuckoff, who, in 2005, wrote the book \"Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend.\"\n\nHe doesn\u2019t buy the comparison.\n\n\"The important difference and the fundamental difference is that there is no secret to how Social Security is run,\" \u00a0said Zuckoff, who researched the question for a 2009 article in Fortune Magazine. \"No one is being misled, no one is taking the money and running, \u00a0which are fundamental aspects of a true Ponzi schemes.\"\n\nComparing the two \"is a common, and I \u00a0think deeply misleading suggestion, that is openly used more as scare tactic than to truly illuminate the real issues,\" Zuckoff said in an interview.\n\nIn his Fortune piece, Zuckoff wrote: \u00a0\"Social Security is morally the polar opposite of a Ponzi scheme and fundamentally different from what Madoff ... did.\"\n\nSo, let\u2019s come back to Johnson\u2019s original statement.\n\nThe candidate says politicians \"run Social Security like a Ponzi scheme.\" On a superficial level, that is true -- money is taken in from current workers (new participants) and used to pay off obligations to retirees (old participants). The operative word is \"superficial.\"\n\nUnlike a Ponzi, Social Security is obligated to pay benefits, a commitment the shysters who run Ponzi schemes do not share. As for those IOUs, the government is required to make good on the money borrowed from the fund -- and to pay it back with interest.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, participants are aware of how the system is operating. It\u2019s all public. In a Ponzi, investors have no clue where their money is going and are told lies by the promoters"}

No other country even comes close to that figure.\"", "evidence": "During a Fox News interview on June 18, 2012, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., discussed immigration and said that \"a million people a year come into the U.S. legally. No other country even comes close to that figure.\"\n\nWe\u2019ll check these two claims in order.\n\n\"A million people a year come into the U.S. legally\"\n\nThe numbers can get a little complicated, but all the experts we spoke to said Rubio was on solid ground.\n\nAccording to the Department of Homeland Security, the United States accepted 1,062,040 legal permanent residents in fiscal year 2011, a number that has been fairly steady over the past few years. Of this number, roughly 45 percent were new arrivals and about 55 percent were people already in the U.S. whose status was upgraded to \"permanent.\"\n\nSeparately, the U.S. admitted more than 4.4 million people in 2010 on a long-term temporary basis, either for employment or study. This number does not include a much larger total (roughly 42 million people) admitted for shorter stays, including visitors for pleasure or short-term business.\n\nSo while one could say that 46 million people actually \"come into the U.S. legally,\" we\u2019ll give Rubio the benefit of the doubt that he was referring to the 1 million who were granted permanent resident status, not those admitted on a temporary basis.\n\n\"No other country even comes close to that figure\"\n\nWe looked at immigration statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a research group for advanced industrialized nations.\n\nUsing 2009 statistics, the only nation that came close to the U.S. in permanent immigrant inflows was Germany. That year, the U.S. had 1,130,800 permanent immigrants, compared to 606,314 for Germany. So the U.S. had numbers about twice as big. The third-place finisher, Spain, had 469,300.\n\nSo Rubio\u2019s correct on this point, too.\n\nSome additional context\n\nWithout taking away from the accuracy of Rubio\u2019s statements, we thought it would be worthwhile adding a bit of context.\n\nThere are actually many other countries that absorb immigrants at a higher rate than the U.S. does once you factor in the size of each nation\u2019s population.\n\nUsing the measurement of permanent, annual immigrant inflows per overall population, the U.S. in 2009 ranked only 11th out of a selection of 28 advanced industrialized nations, trailing such countries as Australia, Austria, Switzerland, New Zealand, Norway and Ireland.\n\nAnd using United Nations data on the cumulative number of resident immigrants as a share of total population, the U.S. ranks only 25th in the world. Some of the nations with higher immigrant percentages are small, oil-rich Arab countries with large foreign-worker populations, but others with higher rankings include Israel, Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Ireland, Spain and Sweden.\n\nOn the other hand, the U.S. does diverge from most of the rest of the world on the rights granted immigrants once they are made permanent.\n\n\"Where the U.S. differs from most European countries is that the immigrants we admit are generally eligible for full membership in society through naturalization, and that the immigrants' U.S.-born children are automatically citizens with full rights,\" said Jeffrey S. Passel, senior demographer with the Pew Hispanic Center. \"Neither of these is generally the case in Europe.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nRubio is right that \"a million people a year come into the U.S. legally\" and that \"no other country even comes close to that figure"}

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Rick Scott Says Tri-Rail shows the potential problems with investing in high-speed rail.", "evidence": "It's become Florida Gov. Rick Scott's version of a campfire ghost story: Stay away from high-speed rail, or you'll wind up with a huge money suck on your hands.\n\nJust like Tri-Rail in South Florida.\n\nScott has repeatedly tried to draw parallels between the two rail systems, saying the 71-mile commuter train now running through Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties is hardly covering its costs. So why would the Orlando to Tampa system? Scott again drilled home the point during a national TV appearance on Feb. 27, 2011, when he was asked to explain his decision to reject $2.4 billion in federal funding for the high-speed rail line.\n\n\"What I have said all along is our taxpayers aren't going to take the risk of the cost overrun in building it. It could be $3 billion ...,\" Scott told CNN's Candy Crowley. \"We already have a train that goes from Palm Beach to Miami. Only one-sixth of the cost of operation is covered by the fares.\"\n\nWhile legislators and the Florida Department of Transportation said private contractors would be required to pay for any high-speed rail\u00a0construction cost overruns, Scott halted the project before it went out for bid. So we can't really check that part of his statement.\n\nBut we can examine his comparison to the Tri-Rail system.\n\nThe numbers for Tri-Rail\n\nThe Tri-Rail system started operating in 1989 as a temporary way to alleviate traffic congestion that was expected to be created by a massive road-widening project on Interstate 95. But the state Legislature decided to keep the system alive permanently through a funding agreement between the state and Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. The federal government also helps fund the rail line through the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Transit Administration.\n\nA total of 3.6 million riders used Tri-Rail in fiscal year 2010, down from 4.2 million riders in FY 2009.\n\nScott described his problems with Tri-Rail in more detail during a Feb. 21 interview with the St. Petersburg Times, and suggested its story acts as a warning for people considering the high-speed rail proposal. \"Let's all remember. We have Tri-Rail right now. Tri-Rail costs us $64 million to operate. The fares only cover $10 million of it,\" he said. \"The state's funding almost $35 million of that. So I'm not going to put our state taxpayers in a similar position.\" The fuller context of Scott's thoughts on Tri-Rail better explain his comment to CNN that only one-sixth of the cost of operation is covered by fares -- fares of about $10 million divided into a $64 million operating budget.\n\nWe reached out to the governor's office to ask them about their figures, but we did not get a response.\n\nSo we turned to the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority, the agency that oversees Tri-Rail.\n\nAccording to the authority's certified financial reports, Tri-Rail took in about $10.3 million in operating revenues in fiscal year 2010 -- an increase of $3 million since 2007. That's the good news.\n\nThe bad? Operating expenses totaled $54.5 million in FY 2010, according to the financial reports. Bonnie Arnold, a spokeswoman for the authority, confirmed the figures in the report. She said the authority also received $10 million in federal money for preventative maintenance, which might be how Scott arrived at his $64 million figure. That's in addition to the normal operating subsidies provided by the federal government.\n\nThe financial report concluded that rider fares covered between one-fourth and one-fifth of Tri-Rail's operating costs in 2010 (23 percent, see Page 63 of the report), up from 22 percent in 2009 and 19 percent in 2008. The rest of the money comes in the form of subsidies from the state, the counties and the federal government.\n\nThe report reveals that Scott is a little off by saying one-sixth, which is the equivalent of about 17 percent.\n\nBut the more important question is whether Tri-Rail's failures at the fare box really are evidence that high-speed rail won't work as it's proposed? Are the two rail lines enough alike for comparison?\n\nThat's where this claim gets off track.\n\nA subsidy surprise?\n\nGovernments and transportation experts walked into the Tri-Rail project with their eyes wide open. They knew the project would be subsidized by taxpayers. The question was just how much.\n\nThe legislation that created the Tri-Rail line required the commuter system to recoup 60 percent of its operating costs. That number, however, was quickly panned as unrealistic. \"Almost no one can recover that,\" then Tri-Rail executive director William Howard told the South Florida Business Journal in 1988, before the system was even operating. The pessimism was shared by George Sirianni, a public transportation specialist\u00a0with the Florida Department of Transportation. Sixty percent is \"really high,\" he said. \"The national average for public transportation systems is only about 20 to 30 percent.\"\n\nIn 1992, the state formally amended its requirement, saying that Tri-Rail needed to recoup 25 percent of its costs, according to the Miami Herald.\n\nThat's about the what the system now pays for, though it's not what was initially anticipated by the Legislature.\n\nCompare that to the Tampa-Orlando line, where experts say there will be no public government subsidy.\n\nThe most recent available ridership studies for the Tampa-Orlando line predict about 2.4 million riders in the system's first year, enough to cover the operational expenses of the system. In rejecting federal funding, Scott said he was briefed on a new ridership study that concluded the system would have 3.07 million riders annually. We're assuming the new study concludes that passengers will cover the costs to operate the high-speed rail line. (We can't say for certain because the state has yet to make that study available, and in fact, has taken down the official web site discussing the high-speed rail project.)\n\nSo to recap, Tri-Rail was created with the idea it would be subsidized; high-speed rail is being proposed as a system that won't need government support.\n\nBut that's not the only difference.\n\nThe Tampa-Orlando line would have five stops over 84 miles of track, with trains reaching speeds up to 168 mph. A trip between Tampa and the Orlando International Airport would take 55 minutes, according to estimates. Tri-Rail, meanwhile, has 18 stops over 71 miles and it takes one hour, 55 minutes to travel from one end of the route to the other.\n\nRob Gregg, director of transit management and innovation at the University of South Florida's Center for Urban Transportation Research, said high-speed rail is like an interstate while commuter rail is like a parkway.\n\n"}

DACA stands for the Trump-rescinded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program created on President Barack Obama's watch to shield hundreds of thousands of young immigrants from deportation.\nWe focused this fact-check on Trump\u2019s fresh statement that \"caravans\" are coming our way, presumably\u00a0from south of the Texas-Mexico border.\nTo our inquiry, a White House spokesman, Steven Cheung, said by email that there have been such caravans in the past and estimates indicate there are\u00a01,000 individuals participating in the caravan Trump had in mind.\nA Fox News discussion\nCheung didn't provide more detail.

The Post story took note that a leader of the National Border Patrol Council, which says it represents some 18,000 Border Patrol agents and support personnel, had been interviewed on the Fox News program. Afterward, the council asserted in a web post that Trump\u2019s tweet was referring to a large group of immigrants making their way to the U.S. border.\nIn the Fox News segment, the council\u2019s president, Brandon Judd, was asked how the Border Patrol would react to the group eventually arriving at the border. Judd responded that a Mexican government entity was helping the group proceed and Pueblos Sin Fronteras, a U.S. group, also was helping. Judd said that once the people made it across the border, each one could request political asylum before getting released by authorities and then not showing up later for an immigration hearing.\nNews stories confirm caravan entered Mexico\nFox News\u2019s report was accompanied by a photo tweeted by Adolfo Flores, national security correspondent for BuzzFeed News, who reported from Mexico March 30, 2018, that hundreds of men, women and children had crossed into Mexico from Central America and were moving north--1,200 as of the group\u2019s first night in Mexico, the story said.\nBuzzFeed\u2019s story said:\n\"For five days now hundreds of Central Americans \u2014 children, women, and men, most of them from Honduras \u2014 have boldly crossed immigration checkpoints, military bases, and police in a desperate, sometimes chaotic march toward the United States.

Suggest that Bush financed those projects by plundering Social Security\u2019s retirement coffers, and you\u2019ve got yourself a popular meme.\n\"Next time a Republican tells you that \u2018Social Security is broke,\u2019 remind them that Pres. Bush \u2018borrowed\u2019 $1.37 trillion of Social Security surplus revenue to pay for his tax cuts for the rich and his war in Iraq and never paid it back,\" reads one version of the meme, which appeared on the Facebook pages of Occupy Democrats and Americans Against the Republican Party.\nA number of readers asked us to check out the claim, so we decided to take a look. The meme seems to extrapolate a point made in a 2009 newsletter post by Allen W. Smith, a professor of economics emeritus from Eastern Illinois University.\n\"Bush spent every dime of Social Security surplus revenue that came in during his presidency. He used it to fund his big tax cuts for the rich, and much of it was spent on wars,\" Smith wrote.\nThe meme\u2019s claim and Smith\u2019s argument circle back to how Social Security funds are managed. Experts say words like \"borrow\"\u00a0and \"raid\"\u00a0don\u2019t really capture how the system works.\nBonds, \u2018borrowing,\u2019 and Bush\nFor about 50 years, Social Security was a \"pay-as-you-go\" system, meaning annual payroll taxes pretty much covered that year\u2019s benefits checks. Then in 1982, President Ronald Reagan enacted a payroll tax hike to prepare for the impending surge of retiring baby boomers, and a surplus began to build.\nBy law, the U.S. Treasury is required to take the surplus and, in exchange, issue interest-accruing bonds to the Social Security trust funds. The Treasury, meanwhile, uses the cash to fund government expenses, though it has to repay the bonds whenever the Social Security commissioner wants to redeem them.\nIn this broad sense, Bush technically did \"borrow\"\u00a0Social Security surplus to pay for the income tax cuts and the Iraq war. But even if we use this loose definition of the word, we still run into a few issues.\nFirst, the amount of surplus Bush \"borrowed\" is actually around $708 billion, a little more than half of the $1.37 trillion claimed in the meme. While around $1.52 trillion in bonds was added to the trust funds from 2000 to 2008, the Treasury only has access to the cash revenue collected every year, not the interest accrued on the entire surplus.\nSecond, Bush didn\u2019t exclusively spend on the war, which has an estimated cost of\u00a0$1.7 trillion. Other big costs include the financial bailout in 2008.\n\"Since all money is green, the cash that the Treasury received from the Social Security surplus was not earmarked for any specific government program,\" said Andrew Eschtruth, a former Social Security research analyst at the U.S. Government Accountability Office and current spokesperson for the Center on Retirement Research at Boston College.\nThe larger question is whether the existence of the surplus influenced Congress\u2019 spending decisions, but Eschew pointed out that no one can prove what was on the lawmakers\u2019 minds.\n\"The idea that lawmakers consciously thought, \u2018We can only go into Iraq because of the surplus\u2019 is a stretch,\" he said.\nThird, if we characterize the entire trust fund system as the government borrowing from Social Security, Bush is by no means the only debtor.\n\"That\u2019s how the Social Security trust fund has worked ever since the program started, so there\u2019s no point in focusing on Bush,\" said Andrew Biggs, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \"You could focus on pretty much any president.\"\n\n"}

The law is now facing a Supreme Court challenge backed by the Trump administration, and Democrats running for Congress this fall have hammered Republicans over the potential threat to those protections in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic and ensuing economic recession.\nStevens\u2019 ad predicts that if the ACA is repealed by Congress or overturned by the Supreme Court, insurance companies would be free to designate coronavirus infections as a preexisting condition and restrict or deny coverage for those infected.\nBut Stevens\u2019 claim exaggerates the potential impact by citing the roughly 100,000 Michiganders who have survived COVID-19, because not all of them have insurance through the individual market. Most people who are currently covered by job-based programs, or through Medicaid or Medicare, for example, would not be at risk of suddenly losing their coverage if insurers designate COVID-19 a preexisting condition.\nA different story would play out for Michiganders who may lose or change jobs amid the recession if the ACA is repealed or overturned.

The ACA\u2019s original protections were made possible by a complex system of mandates and subsidies designed to stabilize the individual insurance market.\n\"In a voluntary insurance market that is not subsidized, there is a powerful and innate need for insurers to avoid the highest-cost people,\" says Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \"There\u2019s always this powerful incentive to compete on the basis of cherry-picking.\"\nAhead of the August primary, Essahki committed to waiting to repeal the law until one that protects coverage of preexisting conditions is enacted and said he opposes Republican efforts to repeal the ACA without a replacement. In an email to PolitiFact Michigan, Esshaki called Stevens a \"scaremonger\" who \"fabricates attacks.\"\nStevens\u2019 campaign called Esshaki one in a \"long line of Washington Republicans who promise to conjure up a brand new plan to protect people with preexisting conditions, even though we all know the new plan is never coming.\"\n\n"}
{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Your Choice Colorado Expanding the sale of full-strength beer and wine to grocery stores is\u00a0\"good for everybody.\"", "evidence": "The feel-good TV ad featuring images of Colorado outdoor adventurers and happy people holding beers bottles declares it's time to \"give Coloradans what they want \u2014 real craft beer at grocery stores.\"\nThe political ad is sponsored by King Soopers, Walmart and Safeway, big chains that are backing a Colorado ballot measure to allow grocery and big box stores to sell full-strength beer and wine. The campaign operates under the group Your Choice Colorado.\nThe ad features Chris Phelps, co-owner of Saint Patrick\u2019s Brewing Company, who says if the proposal becomes reality, \"People have more access to it (craft beer), the breweries have more access to the people, and it's good for everybody.\"\nThat heady assessment is hotly contested by opponents, who say the ballot measure would hurt craft breweries and wineries because big grocery chains would just offer the better-known craft brands. They also warn it would cause the demise of hundreds of liquor stores, a crucial marketplace for craft brewers and wineries.\nWe decided to examine the ad's claim that expanding the sale of full-strength beer and wine to grocery and big box stores will be \"good for everybody.\"\nBrewhaha years in the making\nThe brewing debate highlights a contradictory quirk about Colorado, where marijuana chain stores are legal but state law prohibits chain stores that sell alcohol. This in a state whose craft brewery industry nationally ranks first for state economic contribution per capita, second in the average amount of beer consumed by drinking-age adults (13.6 gallons annually), and third in barrels of craft beer produced (1.7 million annually).\nUnder current state law, a grocery store chain can only have one licensed location that sells full-strength beer, wine and liquor. The one-location-per-license limit also applies to liquor stores. Otherwise, the state restricts grocery and convenience stores to selling beer that contains just 3.2 percent alcohol. Colorado is one of five states in the country that have the 3.2 percent beer restriction. (The others are Utah, Kansas, Minnesota and Oklahoma).\nColorado's liquors restrictions date back more than 80 years ago to the end of Prohibition, the nation's 13-year ban on booze.\nColorado liquor stores have a near-monopoly on the sale of beer, wine and hard liquor \u2014 except for the one liquor store outlet each grocery store chain can operate.\nGrocery store-funded study: Everybody wins!\nYour Choice Colorado argues modernizing the state\u2019s \"antiquated\" alcohol laws will save consumers time and money, create about 200 new grocery stores, add an estimated 22,000 new jobs and boost craft beer sales by $125 million.\nThis analysis comes from a study by a University of Denver economist funded by King Soopers, Walmart and Safeway. You can imagine why the opposing campaign, Keep Colorado Local, an alliance of liquor stores, craft breweries, wineries and the Colorado Restaurant Association, questions the findings right off the bat.\nAllowing full-strength beer and wine sales at grocery and big box stores will cut the prices Coloradans pay by 18 percent through increased competition, the study said.\n\"Alcohol restrictions act like a tax on Colorado consumers, by contributing to significantly higher alcohol prices and limiting consumer choice,\" said the study\u2019s author, Jack Strauss, the DU economics professor.\nStrauss calls the state\u2019s liquor stores a \"protected class,\" because they don\u2019t face competitive pressure to lower prices and have a comparatively low business failure rate.\nBut the economist said\u00a0the law is also bad for craft-beer brewers, because their products are denied access to a wider marketplace.\nPassage of the ballot measure would bring tens of millions in sales to medium- to large-sized craft brewers, Strauss said, and smaller brewers could do well if they have a good product and \"get lucky\" by gaining access to the big retail stores. Small brewers, however, should continue to find a \"specialty\" product niche in liquor stores, he added.\nStrauss said his conclusions are supported by sales data from Washington state and Oregon, big craft-brewing states where full-strength beer and wine are sold in grocery and big box stores. He said Safeway and Kroger\u2019s sales of local craft beer in Oregon and Washington are well over $100 million annually.\nMeanwhile, liquor store sales in Portland and Seattle have more sales per capita of 55 percent and 14 percent, respectively, than Denver liquor stores, Strauss said.\nIn Colorado, he noted that liquor stores appear to be thriving near grocery and big-box stores that have their chain\u2019s allotted one liquor-store location. He counted about 75 liquor stores near the King Soopers and Target stores that sell alcohol in Glendale and 35 liquor stores near the Safeway that sells alcohol in Littleton.\nStill, Strauss acknowledges there\u2019s a possibility of \"some small liquor stores potentially going under.\"\n\n"}

We rated that statement Half True. Miller, though, doesn't mention the 10-year period, so that takes the first part of his statement even more off the mark.\n\nBut what about the education-related cuts?\n\nWere they the \"most drastic cuts to K-12 public schools of any state in the nation\"? And by what measure?\n\nMiller pointed us to a September 2011 study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities that compared state-by-state budget cuts.\n\nHe specifically noted media coverage of the study in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Madison\u2019s Capital Times and the Wisconsin Radio Network -- all of which emphasized the #1 ranking in either a headline or first paragraph.\n\nLet\u2019s take a deeper look.\n\nThe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, obtained budget data from 24 states -- not all 50 -- in conducting what experts told us was the only study that has attempted to quantify the recession-era cutbacks by state governments in aid to local schools.\n\nThe group analyzed state general education funding that is sent to local schools using formulas and ranked states by two measures.\n\nIt did not attempt to catalog how much individual school districts might have saved in costs due to limits on collective bargaining included in Walker\u2019s budget-repair bill. But, that is potentially important. The state money to local schools was cut, but many districts were able to use the new freedom from union contracts to cut their own budgets to recover some or even all of the lost state aid. That limited the overall negative impact on the classroom.\n\nThe study is ongoing, as the group is trying to gather information from the remaining 26 states. For those states, the information was not yet available or there were other obstacles to crunching the numbers, said Phil Oliff, a policy analyst who co-authored the study.\n\nThe study found that Wisconsin had plenty of company in cutting aid for 2011-12 over the previous year -- 21 of the 24 states have cut per-student funding to some degree.\n\nThe study noted: \"Some of the deepest reductions to K-12 formula funding since the onset of the recession have occurred in the past year, as federal aid intended to sustain state education spending has expired, rainy day funds have been exhausted, and states have resisted raising additional taxes to offset the need for cuts.\"\n\nIt ranked Wisconsin\u2019s cuts as third deepest in percent change in spending per student (10.0%). The study highlighted this finding: \"Of the states surveyed, the three states that reduced per student funding the most since last year are Illinois, Texas, and Wisconsin.\"\n\nSo, it\u2019s a poor ranking, to be sure. But that\u2019s not Number 1.\n\nBy another measure, Wisconsin was Number 1 -- the dollar change per student (-$635). This was covered in a chart in the study and that is what drew the headlines -- and Miller\u2019s attention.\n\nOliff told us that both measures were useful, just from different perspectives. A prominent Wisconsin education funding researcher who reviewed the group\u2019s numbers, University of Wisconsin-Madison professor Andrew Reschovsky, agreed both measures are important.\n\n\"The bottom line is Wisconsin has made very deep cuts, either year over year or compared to pre-recession (levels),\" Oliff told us. \"Some of the deepest cuts in the nation.\"\n\nWe asked Reschovsky how he would characterize Wisconsin\u2019s rankings based on the study.\n\n"}

{"label": "pants-fire", "claim": "Ron Paul \"Today gasoline hit $6 a gallon in Florida.\"", "evidence": "There\u2019s no doubt gas prices in Florida have been on the rise -- but have they really hit $6 a gallon?\n\nThat was the surprising claim from Ron Paul at the Republican presidential debate in Arizona on Feb. 22, 2012.\n\nIt started with CNN moderator John King asking candidates what should be done about Syria.\n\nPaul, a congressman from Texas, was making a point about the downside of U.S. intervention in foreign countries, which led to an aside about gas prices.\n\n\"You know, I've tried the moral argument. I've tried the constitutional argument on these issues. And they don't go so well. But there's an economic argument, as well,\" Paul said.\n\n\"As a matter of fact, al-Qaida has had a plan to bog us down in the Middle East and bankrupt this country. That's exactly what they're doing. We've spent $4 trillion of debt in the last 10 years being bogged down in the Middle East. The neoconservatives who now want us to be in Syria, want us to go to Iran, have another war, and we don't have the money -- today gasoline hit $6 a gallon in Florida -- and we don't have the money.\"\n\nInternational geopolitics is one thing, but $6 gas hits close to home. So we decided to check it out.\n\nWe emailed the Paul campaign, but we didn\u2019t hear back. Still, it didn\u2019t take long to find some likely suspects for sources. The Drudge Report, for example, featured the headline \"$6 gas\" just a few hours before the debate\u2019s start. The Drudge Report\u2019s link sent readers to a Tampa television station's report that a couple of gas stations in Florida are charging close to $6 a gallon.\n\nThe report\u2019s source was GasBuddy.com, a website that tracks prices by gas station so consumers can find the cheapest prices and avoid the highest. Sure enough, when we checked GasBuddy the morning after the debate, we found one gas station that was charging $5.79 a gallon and another that was charging $5.69. (You can read user reviews on Yelp.com for the two gas stations here and here.)\n\nSo that\u2019s two gas stations out of the entire state. Every other gas station charged much less, with the next highest at $4.35.\n\nMost notably, those two gas stations are suspiciously close to the beating heart of Florida tourism -- the international airport that brings visitors to Walt Disney World.\n\n\"Florida residents know better than to get gas there. It's entirely to clip the tourists,\" said Gregg Laskoski, an analyst with GasBuddy. Citing those two stations \"totally exaggerates the gas prices situation here in Florida.\"\n\nLaskoski told us it\u2019s not the first time a few stations have given the wrong impression about gas prices statewide.\n\n\"Every year, these stories about a couple of gas stations in the Orlando area pop up, to represent extreme gas stations,\" he said. \"This is not a new story; it's an old story with a new price.\"\n\nStatewide averages are high by historical standards but much lower than Paul's scary $6 figure. The day after the debate, GasBuddy was reporting the average Florida price as $3.70.\n\nAAA\u2019s Fuel Gauge Report set the average Florida price similarly, at $3.70 for a gallon of regular unleaded.\n\nJessica Brady, a spokesperson for AAA, said $6 a gallon was not accurate. And while average gas prices are going up, she said she didn\u2019t expect them to hit $6, at least not anytime soon.\n\n\"It is going up, and it's expected to continue to go up into the spring and the summer,\" Brady said. \"It's possible by spring we could see prices at $4 a gallon.\"\n\nBrady blamed the rising gas prices on mounting tensions with Iran; economic instability in Europe; fluctuating expectations of economic growth in the United States; and seasonal refinery maintenance.\n\nWe also spoke with Izzy Rommes, director of the division of standards at the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, which regulates gasoline.\n\nHe said he wasn\u2019t familiar with the Orlando gas stations in question, but said the state generally only acts on complaints of price gouging during hurricanes or other natural disasters.\n\n\"The market controls the price of gas absent a declaration of emergency,\" he said. \"As long as the price is disclosed, there's nothing wrong with it.\"\n\nFinally, we spoke with \"Bob,\" last name unknown, who answered the phone at Suncoast Energys, one of the gas stations in question. No one there wanted to answer our questions, he said. He added that the station hasn\u2019t changed its prices since May of last year.\n\nOur ruling\n\nFlorida drivers can take a small measure of gratitude in the fact that gas prices are not at $6 a gallon.\n\nOr $5 a gallon.\n\nOr $4 a gallon.\n\nThe statewide average is $3.70.\n\n"}

And so there are some core regulations that we've got to maintain.\n\n\"What I have done -- and this is unprecedented, by the way; no administration has done this before -- is I've said to each agency, 'Don't just look at current regulations or don't just look at future regulations, regulations that we're proposing.

And we found it isn't.\n\nIn 1993, President Bill Clinton created the National Partnership for Reinventing Government (NPR), headed by Vice President Al Gore. Among other things the NPR was tasked with cutting regulatory red tape.\n\nOn Sept. 30, 1993, when Clinton issued Executive Order 12866 calling for a comprehensive review of regulatory policy, he used language that sounds a lot like Obama's. Here's the directive on existing regulations:\n\n\"In order to reduce the regulatory burden on the American people, their families, their communities, their State, local, and tribal governments, and their industries; to determine whether regulations promulgated by the executive branch of the Federal Government have become unjustified or unnecessary as a result of changed circumstances; to confirm that regulations are both compatible with each other and not duplicative or inappropriately burdensome in the aggregate; to ensure that all regulations are consistent with the President\u2019s priorities and the principles set forth in this Executive order, within applicable law; and to otherwise improve the effectiveness of existing regulations: (a) Within 90 days of the date of this Executive order, each agency shall submit to OIRA (Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs) a program, consistent with its resources and regulatory priorities, under which the agency will periodically review its existing significant regulations to determine whether any such regulations should be modified or eliminated so as to make the agency\u2019s regulatory program more effective in achieving the regulatory objectives, less burdensome, or in greater alignment with the President\u2019s priorities and the principles set forth in this Executive order.\"\n\nElaine Kamarck, a special assistant to Gore who managed the project, told us via e-mail.\"We conducted, as part of the reinventing government initiative, a regulatory review that resulted in 16,000 pages being cut from the federal register.\" Kamarck is now a lecturer in public policy at Harvard.\n\nHere's how a June 13, 1995, story in the Washington Post described the results:\n\nPresident Clinton said good riddance to 16,000 pages of federal regulations yesterday and took special satisfaction in saying goodbye to a rule on how to test the consistency of southern grits.\n\n\"I would wager a considerable amount of money that no one will ever write me a letter complaining about the demise of these regulations,\" Clinton told small business leaders, with all 16,000 pages stacked up next to his lectern.\n\nClinton said the pages were being removed from the Code of Federal Regulations, out of 86,000 pages reviewed with an eye toward eliminating unnecessary red tape.\n\nJames Gattuso, a senior research fellow in regulatory policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Clinton's executive order directed all agencies to regularly review rules on their books. \"That order is still in force, making the Obama directive technically redundant,\" Gattuso said.\n\nAnd Clinton wasn't the first to initiate comprehensive regulatory review, said Gattuso. In the early 1990's when Gattuso was on the staff of Vice President Dan Quayle, President George H.W. Bush ordered a 90-day (later extended another 120 days) moratorium and review of all existing regulations.\n\n\"I was on the vice president\u2019s staff at that time working on the initiative and have found the parallels (to now) striking,\" Gattuso said.\n\nIn a Jan. 28, 1992, memo to department and agency heads on \"Reducing the Burden of Government Regulation,\" Bush wrote: \u00a0\n\n\"I am concerned that, because of the constant pressure to develop new programs, we are not doing nearly enough to review and revise existing programs. For that reason, I ask that each of your agencies set aside a 90-day period, beginning today, to evaluate existing regulations and programs and to identify and accelerate action on initiatives that will eliminate any unnecessary regulatory burden or otherwise promote economic growth.\"\n\nDean Baker, a liberal economist and co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, called Obama's comment a \"nonsense claim.\"\n\n\"I would question whether President Obama has done more in re-examining existing regulations than prior presidents, and if he has I would ask why he wasted the resources,\" Baker told us via e-mail. \"Whatever it is called, presidents are always reviewing regulations to eliminate ones that impose unnecessary burdens.\"\n\nIn fact, a U.S. Government Accountability Office report on July 16, 2007, states that, \"Every president since President Carter has directed agencies to evaluate or reconsider existing regulations.\"\n\n"}

But what struck us in this case was that Rubio not only accused Crist of flipping on issues, but then brazenly criticizing Rubio for positions Crist himself held not too long ago.\n\nOur gameplan is to start the search where Rubio suggested, a Fox News debate back on March 28, 2010. But we also think it's fair to at least examine other Crist attacks that didn't come up in the March Fox debate.\n\nLooking back at Crist-R, circa March 2010\n\nMuch of the Fox debate, moderated by Chris Wallace, focused on Crist and Rubio arguing about Rubio's personal finances. (Some things never change).\n\nBut when it came to policy issues, the debate largely covered four topics -- jobs and the economy, Social Security, health care and immigration. What we found might actually surprise you -- Crist's statements then and now are very consistent.\n\nBoth in March and this month, he said he would support the idea of raising the eligibility age for Social Security. Then and now, he said he supported the federal stimulus program. Then there's his answers on immigration. They are nearly identical.\n\nHe said both in March and during the October CNN debate that the country needed to first secure or seal the border and enforce the laws now on the books. Then, in both instances, he talked about a way to gain citizenship for people now living here illegally.\n\n\"If they have the opportunity to gain citizenship, they should go to the back of the line, go through the regular process, what the law requires, in order to attain their citizenship,\" Crist said on March 28 as a Republican.\n\nThen on Oct. 24 as an independent: \"People should have to get in the back of the line, pay a fine if necessary, their back taxes, and be able to become productive members of the American economy. It's a compassionate way.\"\n\n"}

You know, we had the dumpers who were hurting your steel industry.\" Trump said at an Oct. 12 rally in Lebanon, Ohio.\nTrump was in town to support Ohio Republicans, including U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci, who is challenging Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown. While Brown has been ahead in the polls, Ohio is considered a competitive state for Republicans following Trump\u2019s strong win in the battleground state in 2016.\n\nWe looked at whether steel mills across Ohio had, in fact, reopened. We found evidence of one idling mill reopening and a handful of steel companies making additional investments in Ohio. Trump\u2019s claim of mills across the state reopening is exaggerated, but steel companies are making new investments.\nOhio reopenings and investments\nEarlier this year, Trump announced a 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent tariff on aluminum, which he argued would protect American metals industries in competing with foreign imports.\n\nThe White House did not respond to our request for comment.\n\nIn Ohio, there are 7,700 iron, steel mill and ferroalloy manufacturing jobs as of Sept. 1, which is roughly the same amount as there were in January 2017.\n\n\"When you look at the employment numbers (in Ohio), you cannot find an increase in employment from the June imposition (of the steel tariffs) or from when the rumors started kicking around in January,\" said Ohio State University professor Ned Hill, an economist who studies American manufacturing.\n\"The notion that there are hundreds of mills reopening or ready to reopen, there\u2019s not much behind that,\" Hill said.\n\nWe found several examples of steel mills reopening or expanding in the two years, both before and after Trump announced the steel tariffs earlier this year.\n\nIn June 2018, Republic Steel announced plans to restart its furnace in Lorain, Ohio, after it had idled since 2016. It partially reopened in September 2018, bringing 80 new jobs to the city. The company credited the steel tariff. Republic Steel is also adding a shift at its Canton location.\n\nJSW Steel USA initially planned to restart the Mingo Junction electric-arc furnace in September 2018. On Oct. 11, the company said it would restart in a \"matter of weeks.\" The furnace has been idle since 2009. Plans to reopen precede Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nIn January 2017, before the tariff, Charter Steel announced plans to build a new $150 million mill in Cuyahoga Heights, Ohio. In April 2017, Nucor Corp. announced it would invest $85 million to upgrade the rolling mill at its steel bar mill in Marion, Ohio.\n\n"}
{"label": "half-true", "claim": "Joe Biden The 30 percent tax rate called for under President Barack Obama\u2019s proposed Buffett Rule \"is lower than the prescribed tax rate for millionaires already -- not just for millionaires, for people making over $200,000.\"", "evidence": "The White House has recently mounted several public events to rally support for a proposal it calls the \"Buffett Rule\" -- a provision that would ensure that the richest Americans wouldn\u2019t pay federal income tax rates lower than that of middle-income Americans.\n\nDuring an April 12, 2012, visit to Exeter, N.H., Vice President Joe Biden focused his speech on the proposal. Here\u2019s a portion of what Biden said:\n\n\"No one who makes a million dollars or more in any single given year will pay at an effective tax rate that's less than 30 percent.\" Later, he added, \"Anybody making a million dollars can't pay 30 percent in taxes? That's lower than the prescribed tax rate for millionaires already -- not just for millionaires, for people making over $200,000.\"\n\nWe wondered if Biden got his math right.\n\nThe first thing we noticed about Biden\u2019s speech is its definition of the Buffett Rule, which stems from billionaire investor Warren Buffett\u2019s observation that his secretary paid a higher tax rate than he did. It differed from what appeared in a White House web page on the topic.\n\nThe White House website defines the Buffett Rule without citing a specific tax rate: \"No household making more than $1 million each year should pay a smaller share of their income in taxes than a middle class family pays,\" the Web page says.\n\nIt turns out that the White House has filled in some of the operational details elsewhere, and the 30 percent rate is indeed what the rule would require.\n\nThe president\u2019s fiscal year 2013 budget proposal said that \"those making over $1 million should pay no less than 30 percent of their income in taxes. The administration will work to ensure that this rule is implemented in a way that is equitable, including not disadvantaging individuals who make large charitable contributions. And he is proposing that the Buffett rule should replace the Alternative Minimum Tax, which now burdens middle-class Americans rather than stopping the richest Americans from paying too little as was originally intended.\"\n\nSo is it true, as Biden said, that the 30 percent tax rate \"is lower than the prescribed tax rate for millionaires already -- not just for millionaires, for people making over $200,000.\"\n\nThat\u2019s a complicated question to answer.\n\nA big part of the confusion comes from Biden\u2019s blurring how tax rates work in his speech.\n\nCurrently, the federal income tax has six \"brackets\" -- ranges of taxable income for which there is a specified tax rate, known as the marginal rate. They are 10 percent, 15 percent, 25 percent, 28 percent, 33 percent and 35 percent. For instance, every taxpayer filing as an individual -- no matter how rich or poor -- pays a 10 percent tax rate on the first $8,700 of income. For the next $26,650, taxpayers pay 15 percent, and so on, all the way up to 35 percent for all income above $388,350. The income cutoffs are different for married couples filing jointly and for heads of households.\n\nTo make this real, let\u2019s take a look at sample taxpayers at the two income levels Biden cited -- $200,000 and $1 million -- using this Web-based tax calculator.\n\n\u2022 Individual earning $200,000. This taxpayer would be in the 33 percent tax bracket -- every dollar over $178,650 would be taxed at 33 percent. However, taking into account the lower tax rates for the dollars earned below $178,650, the effective tax rate for this filer would be just over 25 percent.\n\n\u2022 Married couple earning $200,000 filing jointly. This couple would be in the 28 percent tax bracket -- every dollar over $142,700 would be taxed at 28 percent. However, taking into account the lower tax rates for the dollars earned below $142,700, the effective tax rate for this couple would be a little under 22 percent.\n\n\u2022 Individual earning $1 million. This person would be in the 35 percent tax bracket, with an effective tax rate of 32.7 percent.\n\n\u2022 Married couple earning $1 million filing jointly. This couple would be in the 35 percent tax bracket, and their effective tax rate would be a little under 32 percent.\n\nTwo issues. First, looking only at the highest marginal rates paid, Biden is correct for three of these categories and incorrect on one. Married couples earning $200,000 face a marginal tax rate of 28 percent, not 30 percent.\n\nSecond, taking into account the total tax paid as a percentage of income, Biden is correct that individuals and couples making $1 million a year already face effective rates in excess of 30 percent, but individuals and couples earning $200,000 face effective rates significantly lower than 30 percent -- about 22 percent for couples and 25 percent for individuals. A married couple would have to earn $617,000 to face an effective tax rate of 30 percent, and an individual would need to earn $465,000.\n\nWe should point out that these calculations assume that the taxable income in question is subject to the tax rates levied on ordinary income. In reality, many richer Americans earn a portion of income from capital gains, which are taxed less heavily than most of the ordinary income brackets -- 15 percent. So the effective tax rate for these taxpayers will be lower than the rates cited above. This is what prompted Warren Buffett to write the column that led to the Buffett Rule in the first place. But since it\u2019s not possible for us to construct a model to gauge this factor, we won\u2019t be including it in our discussion.\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn the speech, Biden mixed and matched two different types of tax rates -- marginal tax rates, which refer to the rate paid on the last dollar of income, and effective tax rates, which refer to the percentage of income someone ultimately paid in taxes. When Biden says the rate required by the Buffett Rule \"is lower than the prescribed tax rate for millionaires already,\" he\u2019s comparing the percentage of income paid as taxes (the Buffett Rule) to a marginal tax rate (\"the prescribed tax rate for millionaires already\"). Making this comparison is mixing apples and oranges.\n\nIn the meantime, if you look at the effective tax rates paid by the two groups he\u2019s talking about, he\u2019s right that millionaires already have an effective tax rate of at least 30 percent, assuming their income doesn\u2019t include capital gains -- but he\u2019s wrong when he says that taxpayers earning $200,000 do. In fact, taxpayers would have to have much higher taxable incomes before facing that rate -- $617,000 for married couples and $465,000 for individuals. Overall, Biden\u2019s claim is a mixture of accurate and inaccurate information"}

Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, was one of several speakers at \u00a0a Sept. 21 health care forum in Washington on the future of health care in the United States. Not surprisingly, much of his speech focused on how much the nation spends on health care.\n\nThe forum was organized by the nonprofit Washington-based Partnership for Quality Care, whose members, according to its website, include physician groups, health plans, employers, hospitals, consumer groups and policymakers.\n\nOne point Whitehouse made caught our attention.\n\n\"The American health care system burns 18 percent of our national GDP. Nobody else is close,\" he said.\n\nWe knew our spending was high compared with other industrialized nations, but we wondered whether he got his facts right. \u00a0\n\nFirst, we contacted Whitehous'\u2019s spokesman, Seth Larson, to find out where the information came from. He sent us links to two websites.\n\nThe first link took us to the site for the federal Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nThere, we found this statement: \"Total health expenditures reached $2.5 trillion (in 2009), which translates to $8,086 per person, or 17.6 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product.\" The most recent comparisons are for 2009.\n\n(Gross Domestic Product, the market value of the nation\u2019s production of goods and services, has since been revised for 2009, so the share of health care spending that year was actually 17.8 percent of the GDP, said Thomas Dail, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. Either way, it still rounds to 18 percent, as Whitehouse said.)\n\nNext, we followed the second link to check how the United States\u2019 health care spending compares with spending in other industrialized countries.\n\nThe international data came from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, a Paris-based organization with 34 member countries. The organization, which has an office in Washington, D.C.,\u00a0 is funded by contributions from its member governments.\n\nUnder \"Frequently Asked Questions,\" \u00a0we found a link to a spread-chart that shows annual health expenditures by country as a share of GDP.\n\nIn 2009, the most recent year with complete data, the industrialized country with the next highest health expenditure per GDP is the Netherlands, at 12 percent, followed closely by France, Germany, Denmark, Canada and Sweden -- all above 11 percent.\n\n(It should be noted that many countries that spend far less on health care than the United States get better results on such measures as life expectancy, access to care and treatment of heart attacks and other health problems.)\n\n"}

You know how much the city of Austin reuses? About 5 percent. And that's not right. We can do better.\"\nAdler has talked up San Antonio before; in his September 2014 water agenda, he pointed out San Antonio\u2019s wide lead in water reuse, and advocated reforming Austin\u2019s \"purple pipe\" system (state law requires pipes carrying non-potable treated wastewater be colored purple).\nIt\u2019s no light topic. Texas\u2019 2012 State Water Plan, a 50-year strategy for keeping water supply up with demand, says the state must quadruple its use of reused (or recycled) water, adding over 300 billion gallons to yearly supply by 2060. \u00a0\nTo clarify: Water reuse doesn\u2019t necessarily mean sending purified toilet water to the tap (as Wichita Falls does). Cities normally discharge treated wastewater, not fit to drink, into a local river, but some reuse it for irrigation or industry.\nSan Antonio is recognized as an innovator in water conservation, but in looking into Adler\u2019s statement, we found his comparison doesn\u2019t match apples to apples.\nThat is, San Antonio uses most of its recycled water in ways that Austin cannot: It fills its urban rivers with recycled water and sends recycled water to power plants just a few miles downriver.\nThe comparison also is flawed because the cities already pipe about the same percentage of recycled water through purple pipes to city customers for irrigation and industry.\nAdler\u2019s data\nTo launch this check, we queried Jim Wick, Adler\u2019s campaign manager, on the candidate\u2019s statistics. He provided information received on April 11, 2014 by an Adler supporter, William Moriarty, who is also a member of Austin\u2019s Water and Wastewater Commission.\nMoriarty had requested water recycling statistics from the Austin Water Utility, which serves more than 890,000 customers in Austin and surrounding communities, and the San Antonio Water System, which serves more than 1.6 million customers in Bexar and surrounding counties.\n-Austin Water division manager Raj Bhattarai said Austin\u2019s wastewater treatment plants treated 33.84 billion gallons in 2013, of which 1.47 billion gallons, or 4.3 percent, were reused.\n-SAWS senior resource analyst Gregg Eckhardt said San Antonio\u2019s wastewater treatment plants treated 45.22 billion gallons in 2013, of which 16.2 billion gallons, or about 35 percent, were reused. Eckhardt said 75 percent of the reused water was sent via the San Antonio River to power plants downstream, 15 percent was piped to city customers and 10 percent was added to urban waterways to boost flows.\nBut a July 2014 email, also provided by Wick, threw up a flag; Eckhardt told the Adler campaign that the state, unlike SAWS, doesn\u2019t consider water pumped to boost streamflow to be reused.\nPut another way, not counting flow augmentation, San Antonio reuses about 32 percent of its wastewater.\nThis turn made us wonder: what else are the cities reporting as reused water? \u00a0It was here that we learned about water delivered both via big rivers and purple pipes.\nPurple pipes\nDaryl Slusher, an Austin Water Utility administrator, said by phone Austin\u2019s reuse tally only includes water piped from wastewater treatment plants to customers.\nAustin\u2019s 48 miles of purple pipes serve 69 customers for recycled water including golf courses, city parks and Austin Energy, according to a utility spokesman, Jason Hill, who also said the number of customers the utility could serve was capped by \"infrastructure limitations.\" Meaning? The city has to build more purple pipes.\nThe Austin American-Statesman reported in December 2009 that Austin then planned to spend $180 million expanding the purple pipe system -- over three decades.\nAdler\u2019s web-posted water agenda says city policies make it costly for irrigation customers currently using drinking water to switch to recycled water.\nBy email, Wick told us Adler supports an exemption to the purple-color requirement for irrigators who already have underground networks of white-colored pipes and want to use recycled water. Then again, we realized, the Austin City Council on Nov. 14, 2014, adopted an ordinance doing just that: allowing irrigators to use recycled water without replacing existing pipe networks.\nSo, is Adler\u2019s plan already moot? Not quite, Wick said by email, adding that Adler believes the city\u2019s already-approved expansion of purple pipes should be completed more quickly than planned.\n\n"}

In keeping with standard process, Gration had seen that report and was given the chance to respond before it came out.\nA damaging assessment\nThe first bullet point in the inspector general\u2019s report is a global indictment of Gration\u2019s capacity to serve as chief of mission. It reads:\n\"The Ambassador has lost the respect and confidence of the staff to lead the mission. Of more than 80 chiefs of mission inspected in recent cycles, the Ambassador ranked last for interpersonal relations, next to last on both managerial skill and attention to morale, and third from last in his overall scores from surveys of mission members. The inspectors found no reason to question these assessments; the Ambassador\u2019s leadership to date has been divisive and ineffective.\"\nThe auditors noted that many of the 19 federal agencies operating out of the embassy had little or no access to Gration, who they said showed an \"ongoing unwillingness\" to meet with agency heads.

The letter did not embrace any of Perry\u2019s requests, but noted that a few days after his Austin stop, Obama signed the Southwest Border Security Act into law, enabling the \"addition of substantial and varied law enforcement resources to enhance security on our southern border.\" As an example, the letter said, additional National Guard troops and \"other security resources\" would serve. \"It is anticipated that Texas will have over 20 National Guardsmen serving as criminal investigative analysts in fusion centers and over 225 Guardsmen conducting ground surveillance,\" in National Entry Identification Teams the letter said.\n\nThe letter closed: \"We are united in our common interest and focused efforts to secure the Southwest border. Your continued engagement and partnership on this national security imperative is much appreciated.\"\n\nWe emailed the White House and Department of Homeland Security on this topic and did not hear back. We also asked Havens if the governor responded to Brennan\u2019s letter, and we filed an open-records\u2019 request asking the governor\u2019s office for border-related communications between the state and White House since Perry and Obama visited on the tarmac. No materials came our way in the first few days after we submitted the request.\n\nOur ruling\n\nPerry said he had \"yet to get a response\" to his 2010 letter to Obama requesting border security steps.\n\nThat\u2019s not so. Perry fielded a reply to his letter from a White House deputy about three weeks after the airport howdy. We grant that it might not have contained the answers Perry sought, but saying Perry has yet to get any response strikes us as both inaccurate and ridiculous.\n\n"}

{"label": "barely-true", "claim": "Joaquin Castro \"43,000 people are going to be kicked out of nursing homes or denied nursing home entrance\" if the Texas House version of the state budget passes into law.", "evidence": "State Rep. Joaquin Castro says spending cuts in the Texas House version of the state\u2019s 2012-13 budget will cause vulnerable Texans to suffer. For instance, the San Antonio Democrat said in House debate April 4, \"43,000 people are going to be kicked out of nursing homes or denied nursing home entrance.\"\n\nThe House-passed budget, yet to be answered by the Senate, would reduce by about 10 percent reimbursement rates paid to nursing homes for residents covered by Medicaid, the state- and federally-funded health program for the poor and disabled.\n\nNursing home advocates say actual daily rates would effectively drop 34 percent \u2014 from $123 to $81 per resident \u2014 because the House-adopted budget also doesn\u2019t account for projected increases in health care costs or in Medicaid-supported nursing home residents. Nor does it replace federal stimulus aid that ends this year.\n\nSome perspective: Of about 90,000 nursing home residents statewide, 54,800 \u2014 62 percent \u2014 are covered by Medicaid.\n\nStarting in 1999, \u00a0Medicaid reimbursement rates to nursing homes have increased seven times, most recently going up 2.7 percent in 2009. Rates have been cut thrice, most recently 2 percent as of February.\n\nThe state\u2019s reimbursement rate is 49th nationally, according to an April 9 Austin American-Statesman news article. Also, Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, told us that \"there\u2019s widespread agreement that our rates don\u2019t fully cover costs.\"\n\nWhen we sought backup for Castro\u2019s statement, his office said he got his numbers from the Texas Health Care Association, which represents the state\u2019s nursing home industry.\n\nThe group\u2019s president, Tim Graves, told us that it analyzed the most recent data, covering 2008, to try to estimate \"the scope of the potential impact\" of the proposed cuts. Graves said at least 70 percent of the residents at about half the state\u2019s nursing homes, or 550 facilities, are insured through Medicaid \u2014 figures we confirmed with the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. The association estimates that the average number of residents at these facilities is 83, suggesting that 45,650 residents live in heavily Medicaid-dependent homes that would bear the brunt of the House\u2019s rate cut.\n\nAnd how many nursing home residents would be kicked out or denied care? That number proved elusive.\n\nA Feb. 16 association press release says the reduction \"will force local facilities to significantly cut staffing levels, cut pay \u2014 or worse \u2014 go out of business, leaving local seniors and local workers to make do with no care and no jobs.\"\n\nGraves told us: \"There\u2019s no way I can predict the future, but I can tell you they\u2019ll be in really bad shape. ... Our point is any facility that depends on Medicaid to that extent is going to be in very significant trouble, and that could affect a lot of folks.\"\n\nGraves said the association hasn\u2019t asked every home if it would close upon the proposed rate cut, but conversations with nursing-home operators have persuaded him that widespread closures with residents getting displaced is a valid concern.\n\nAt his suggestion, we contacted the Texas Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, which advocates for about 100 nonprofit nursing homes. President George Linial told us it now costs homes $140 to $150 a day to serve residents. Separately, the state health commission told us the average daily cost for nursing-home care in 2008 was $129 per resident and the state projects that average for 2012-13 to be $133.\n\nLinial shared an association document titled \"Nursing Home Profile for Texas\" stating that if the House-approved rates become law, 896 of the state\u2019s nursing homes will close and 63,616 residents will lose their care.\n\nLinial, calling the group\u2019s forecast \"an estimate... a guess,\" also said: \"It is tough to determine who will close because most nursing homes do not want to alarm their residents by saying they will close ... However, simply looking at their financial statements will tell you that closure is imminent with further cuts.\"\n\nHow did the group reach its numbers? Association vice president David Thomason said he determined from cost data collected by the state health commission that an average of 71 residents lived in the state\u2019s nursing homes in 2008 and that Medicaid-covered residents accounted for 65 percent or more of the occupants of 896 homes. Assuming those homes would close if the House-backed budget becomes law, Thomason said, 63,616 residents would be kicked out of the shuttered homes.\n\nAccording to the health commission, 676 nursing homes in 2009 had 65 percent or more of their residents covered by Medicaid. Informed of this tally, Thomason replied by email that he\u2019d \"rounded up\" in his analysis and the group \"will be happy to agree that at least 676 facilities will close at the current House version of the bill,\" with 47,996 residents kicked out.\n\nWe pressed Thomason on his assumption that this particular cut would force the homes to close, though their reimbursement rates had mostly risen over the past decade. Reminding us of the homes greatly depending on Medicaid, Thomason said: \"There\u2019s no other way around it, you\u2019re going to close.\"\n\nAnne Dunkelberg, associate director of the Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, \u00a0told us that Castro accurately pinned the number of nursing home residents whose \"access to care is at risk.\" Yet whether all those residents \"would lose coverage at once, that may be pushing it,\" she said.\n\nFinally, spokeswomen for HHSC and the Texas Department of Aging and Disability Services, which administers long-term services, said their agencies have not assessed the impact of rate cuts on Medicaid-covered residents. Goodman said: \"We don\u2019t doubt that deep cuts in Medicaid rates would mean that some nursing homes would close.\"\n\nAll in all, Castro\u2019s claim that the House-approved budget would effectively deny 43,000 people nursing home care was not confirmed by the group he cites as his source. Though a different group estimates a larger number, that\u2019s acknowledged as an educated guess.\n\nAt this point, all such predictions are speculative"}

However, the board vice president said by email, he\u2019d meant to say only that each registrar\u2019s responsibility was to make sure eligible students registered -- not that the students went on to vote.\n\"What's interesting is that even though this has been part of our Texas election code,\" he wrote, \"not too many folks seem to be aware of it.\"\n1983 law\nMark us guilty on that count. But an online search brought us to section 13.046 of the Texas election code, \"High School Deputy Registrars,\" stating that each \"principal of a public or private high school or the principal's designee shall serve as a deputy registrar\" in the local county. Each registrar, the law says, \"may distribute registration application forms to and receive registration applications submitted to the deputy in person from students and employees of the school only.\"\nThe law goes on: \"At least twice each school year, a high school deputy registrar shall distribute an officially prescribed registration application form to each student who is or will be 18 years of age or older during that year.\"\nSo, there is a law requiring each high school to have a deputy voter registrar who makes voter registration applications available to eligible students.\nAnd, we learned, the law is unusual. Nationally, only North Carolina has a Texas-like statute, Michael Dolan of the National Conference of State Legislatures told us by email, though the organization knows of a dozen states that in some way regulate voter registration at high schools. Dolan said the North Carolina law requires every public high school to make voter registration forms available to students.\nWe asked Sally Harlow of the Texas Legislative Reference Library about how the Texas law came to be. By email, she guided us to legislative records showing a Dallas Democrat, then-Rep. Paul Ragsdale, ushered the mandate into law in the 1983 legislative session. Few lawmakers voted against the deputy voter registrar requirement, the records show. At the time, Ragsdale described the action as necessary because \"difficulties have been experienced\" in some counties \"in going onto high school campuses to register eligible students to vote.\" (Nationally, the voting age had been lowered from 21 to 18 by a constitutional amendment ratified by the states as of July 1971.)\nTexas rules\nThe Texas law says each high school\u2019s deputy registrar shall distribute the registration applications \"subject to rules prescribed by the secretary of state,\" the state\u2019s chief elections officer, \"who shall prescribe any other needed procedures.\"\n\n"}

Alberta Darling is correct, nearly one of every five acres of land in Wisconsin is owned by the federal, state or county government and is set aside for conservation.\nThat\u2019s open space for forests and parks, as well as for activities such as fishing, hiking, camping and snowmobiling.\nDarling, a suburban Milwaukee Republican, uttered the statistic in the context of: When is enough, enough?\nWith the Legislature considering a reduction in what the state spends on such land acquisitions, it\u2019s time for a conservation conversation.\nJoint Finance and stewardship\nDarling is co-chairwoman of the Legislature\u2019s Joint Finance Committee, a 16-member panel of Senate and Assembly members that reviews all state appropriations and revenue -- most notably the state budget.\nInevitably, the committee makes changes in the governor\u2019s biennial budget proposal before the Legislature adopts the budget and the governor signs it into law.\nOn May 15, 2013, in the thick of reviewing Republican Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s 2014-2015 budget, the GOP-controlled committee discussed whether to spend less on the state stewardship program, which is one way government buys land for conservation. The money comes from borrowing and is repaid with tax dollars.\nAt one point during the discussion, Darling stated:\n\"We've had a lot of people around the state tell us, you know, the stewardship program's a great program. We have a lot of very precious lands. But we have 18 percent of our land in our state right now is either federally, state or county owned for conservation purposes. A lot of our constituents are saying, What is the endgame here?\"\nSo, let\u2019s see where the 18 percent claim comes from.\n(By the way, Walker\u2019s budget proposal kept stewardship spending the same -- $120 million over two years. After its discussion, Joint Finance voted to reduce that amount by $18 million. The state budget is supposed to be finalized by July 1, 2013.)\nDarling\u2019s evidence\nDarling spokesman Bob Delaporte cited two sources to back Darling\u2019s statement.\n1. A January 2013 report from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. It estimated that 5.89 million acres, or 16.95 percent, of Wisconsin\u2019s 34.8 million acres were owned for conservation as of June 30, 2012.\nThat includes the 1.5 million-acre Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest in the North Woods; state forests, such as the 232,000-acre Northern Highland American Legion State Forest in Iron, Oneida, and Vilas counties; as well as county parks and forests.\n2. A March 2013 email from the Department of Natural Resources to the Joint Finance Committee co-chairs, which quotes a higher figure: 18.5 percent.\nThat email noted Wisconsin\u2019s rate is higher than Illinois\u2019 and Iowa\u2019s, which are both below 3 percent; but lower than Michigan\u2019s 22 percent and Minnesota\u2019s 25 percent.\nDarling\u2019s spokesman told us the senator \"went with 18 percent\" during the finance committee discussion because that figure is between the fiscal bureau\u2019s estimate, rounded up, of 17 percent and the DNR\u2019s estimate of 18.5 percent.\nIndeed, either figure, if accurate, would essentially back Darling\u2019s claim, given that they are estimates.\nWe talked with the authors of the fiscal bureau report and the DNR\u2019s email, as well as other officials. One reason the DNR figure is higher is that it included federally owned properties such as military installations. Another reason the DNR\u2019s figure varies from the fiscal bureau\u2019s figure is the estimates were done at different times.\n\n"}

The furloughs triggered flight delays around the country as the FAA scaled back the number of planes that could take off and land because the agency had fewer controllers to direct them.\n\nU.S. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., joined the criticism that the FAA is maximizing the budget cuts\u2019 inconvenience on travelers.\n\n\"Why is President Obama unnecessarily delaying your flight? FAA could cut other spending,\" Cantor tweeted on April 23, 2013.\n\nThe FAA has said it made all the cuts it could but sequestration still leaves no option but to furlough employees.\n\nSo who\u2019s right? We decided to check it out.\n\nCuts & furloughs\n\nWe looked into a similar claim from Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood before the sequester took effect. The Obama administration and federal agencies were warning that flight delays would result.\n\nSequestration is forcing the FAA to carve $600 million from its budget, and LaHood said furloughing air traffic controllers was the last step after every other cut has been made.\n\nBut air traffic controllers make up a big chunk of the FAA\u2019s workforce: 15,000 of its 47,000 employees.\n\n\"We\u2019re looking at everything possible; and everything possible that\u2019s legal, we will do,\" he said at the White House. That includes cutting travel, cutting overtime, freezing hiring, canceling conferences and reducing contracts.\n\nSo what exactly is legal to cut?\n\nThe Budget Control Act of 2011, the law authorizing the sequester, says \"each non-exempt account within a category shall be reduced by a dollar amount calculated by multiplying the baseline level of sequestrable budgetary resources in that account at that time by the uniform percentage necessary to eliminate a breach within that category.\" (That clause comes from a similar deficit control law from 1985, the first time \"sequestration\" was implemented.)\n\nIt means, according to the White House Office of Management and Budget, that sequestration \"must be applied equally at the program, project, and activity level within each budget account.\"\n\n"}
{"label": "true", "claim": "Marco Rubio A private company building a natural gas pipeline into Florida \"is being forced to spend months under the review of six federal agencies.\"", "evidence": "Sen. Marco Rubio previewed a potential 2016 presidential run in his new book, American Dreams, by outlining several policy positions -- including a push for energy independence and a distaste for industrial regulation.\nThe Republican discussed in one chapter the future of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, praising the process known as hydraulic fracturing (or fracking) for providing abundant oil and natural gas. But \"government-created obstacles\" such as overregulation of the energy sector make the United States its own worst enemy, Rubio wrote, and states such as Florida suffer for it.\n\"A private company is interested in building a natural gas pipeline into Florida,\" the book read. \"But before it can even begin construction, it is being forced to spend months under the review of six federal agencies.\"\nNo matter your political stance on government regulation, we\u2019re not civil engineers, so we didn\u2019t know how many federal entities were needed to approve a new pipeline. We decided to pull the permits and find out whether Rubio was correct.\nSabal Trail Transmission\nNeither Rubio\u2019s Senate office nor his book publicist returned our calls, but the biggest pipeline project on the drawing board to come into Florida is the Sabal Trail Transmission expansion.\nThe project stretches about 460 miles from central Alabama through Georgia to Florida just south of Orlando, eventually sending natural gas all the way to a Florida Power & Light plant in South Florida. The state\u2019s gas capacity would increase 20 percent, at a cost of $3 billion. Duke Energy also has plans to build a connection from the pipeline to power its Crystal River plant.\nEnvironmentalists have decried the project, calling the pipeline and its compressor stations unnecessary and the source of too much pollution. It would be the third major natural gas pipeline into the state.\nThe plan begat another controversy when it was discovered that Gov. Rick Scott owned a $53,000 stake in the company responsible for the project after signing legislation in 2013 to help approve permits for the pipeline. The Public Service Commission, run by Scott appointees, later that year approved building the pipeline.\nWhen Scott in 2014 disclosed the assets of a blind trust held in his name as part of his re-election campaign, the Broward Bulldog noted he owned the stake in Spectra Energy, the Houston company working with FP&L\u2019s parent company NextEra Energy to build the pipeline.\nScott\u2019s office argued that because the holdings were bought as part of the blind trust, there\u2019s no way the governor knew about it, and therefore the stake didn\u2019t present a conflict of interest. Scott did use proceeds from the trust to fund in part his 2014 re-election bid. His office told us they had no further comment on the issue.\nSabal Trail Transmission LLC, the joint Spectra and NextEra company building the pipeline, made no secret about the regulatory process for the pipeline, which began surveys in September 2013. The company directed us to a resource report that listed all the agencies from which the company must get approval.

{"label": "true", "claim": "Joe Biden \u201cUntil this week, they [OSHA] weren\u2019t even enforcing these guidelines [for coronavirus]. Still today, OSHA is not specifying which rules employees must follow or how to keep their workers safe and healthy.\u201d", "evidence": "During an April 15 virtual town hall meeting with front-line workers, former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democrats\u2019 presumptive nominee for the White House, was asked by a meat processing worker what he would do to protect workers like her from COVID-19.\n\"We lost a co-worker at my plant because there is no regulation to protect meat chain employees,\" said Safaa Elzakzoky, who is also a member of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. \"We can\u2019t work safely and get people the meat that they need to eat. So what would you do to protect a worker like my friend who just died?\"\nIn his response, Biden called attention to steps taken by the Obama administration during the H1N1 outbreak and criticized the Trump administration. He focused on \"failures\" by the Labor Department and its Occupational Safety and Health Administration to use regulatory powers to protect workers, including OSHA\u2019s lack of action in enforcing specific worker safety guidelines related to COVID-19.\nOSHA issued an advisory guidance in early March on how employers can protect workers from COVID-19, which included encouraging businesses to develop infectious disease plans, to allow frequent hand-washing, to urge workers to stay home when they feel sick and to provide face masks to employees.\nBiden asserted that the agency\u2019s actions fall far short.\n\"Until this week, they weren\u2019t even enforcing these guidelines. Still today, OSHA is not specifying which rules employees must follow or how to keep their workers safe and healthy,\" said Biden.\nWith President Donald Trump\u2019s coronavirus response emerging as a political flashpoint in the presidential campaign, we decided to dig into the administration\u2019s role in ensuring worker safety. And, as headlines increasingly detail how those on the front lines \u2014 health care workers as well as those in grocery stores and meatpacking plants and across the food supply chain \u2014 have contracted and died of COVID-19, we thought it was important to check the veracity of Biden\u2019s claim.\nWe contacted Biden\u2019s campaign to find out the basis for his response. Staffers sent us an April 9 blog post from the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for workers, that outlines how the Trump administration\u2019s OSHA has failed to stipulate and enforce adequate employee protections during the pandemic. They also sent us OSHA\u2019s April 13 enforcement directive.\nWhat could OSHA do?\nOSHA is tasked with ensuring that workplaces are safe and healthy. The agency sets standards and has inspectors determine if workplaces are compliant. If they are not, OSHA issues citations and requires employers to address the problem within a certain timeframe. Failure to do so results in fines or other sanctions.\nThese standards tend to be broad statements that can take a decade to develop and implement. For instance, two Obama-era OSHA officials \u2014 David Michaels, the Labor Department\u2019s assistant secretary for OSHA from 2009 to 2017, and Debbie Berkowitz, a senior OSHA official from 2009 to 2015 \u2014 told us they had worked on developing an infectious disease standard for years, but that effort was halted in 2017 by the Trump administration.\u00a0\nHowever, OSHA also can issue an \"emergency temporary standard\" during a public health emergency, such as the current coronavirus pandemic.\nMajor unions, including the AFL-CIO and National Nurses United, have petitioned OSHA for an emergency temporary standard that would codify that a variety of types of workers are at risk of exposure to COVID-19 and issue detailed safety requirements for specific industries. So far, though, OSHA has not taken this emergency action.\nAlso, the March advisory guidance is not enforceable, said Michaels and Berkowitz. The guideline includes language stating that it is \"not a standard or regulation and creates no new legal obligations.\" And though this document sketched out certain recommendations that would reduce workers\u2019 risk of exposure to COVID-19, when OSHA put out its April 13 enforcement directive, it didn\u2019t mandate that any of those recommendations be followed by workplaces or enforced by OSHA inspectors.\n\n"}
{"label": "pants-fire", "claim": "Newt Gingrich Says he was \"exonerated in every single case\" in 1990s ethics violations charges.", "evidence": "Former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich faced some of his harshest attacks on ethics violations during the Florida GOP primary last month.\n\nOn Feb. 10, Gingrich appeared on Neal Boortz\u2019s radio talk show on AM 750 and 95.5FM News/Talk WSB to make his case.\n\nWith the Georgia primary just weeks away, Boortz told Gingrich that he should have fought harder in Florida against the attacks.\n\n\"Well, look,\" Gingrich replied. \"The Wall Street Journal said the ads were false and that in fact I was exonerated in every single case. National Review said the ads were false, I was exonerated in every single case.\"\n\n\"Exonerated in every single case?\" This was a surprise to us.\n\nA U.S. House of Representatives committee looked into whether Gingrich broke ethics rules in the 1990s. All but one of the charges were dropped, and he was reprimanded by the House in 1997.\n\nIn what amounted to a plea deal, Gingrich agreed to pay $300,000 and admit he had \"engaged in conduct that did not reflect creditably on the House of Representatives.\" \u00a0\n\nSo how could Gingrich have been exonerated? He even admitted to poor conduct.\n\nWe contacted the Gingrich campaign but received no response. We therefore switched gears and took a closer look at the National Review and The Wall Street Journal, the two publications he cited.\n\nBut first, here\u2019s a review of the ethics controversy, as provided by PolitiFact National:\n\nThe case primarily involved a course at Kennesaw State College (now Kennesaw State University) that Gingrich taught while in Congress. Its organizers solicited financial support from \"individuals, corporations and foundations,\" promising that the project qualified for tax-exempt status.\n\nBut the ethics committee concluded that the course aimed to \"help in achieving a partisan, political goal\" -- something that would run afoul of its tax-exempt status.\n\nA further problem for Gingrich was that during the investigation, he submitted letters from his lawyers for which \"the subcommittee was unable to find any factual basis.\" Gingrich \"should have known\" that the information in the letters \"was inaccurate, incomplete and unreliable.\"\n\nThe Abraham Lincoln Opportunity Foundation and the Progress and Freedom Foundation, Gingrich-related groups backed with tax-deductible donations, helped fund the course.\n\nObviously, Gingrich wasn\u2019t exonerated by the House of Representatives. The ethics committee, which has an even number of Republicans and Democrats, voted 7 to 1 to pass a report that recommended a reprimand and $300,000 penalty.\n\nThe full House passed the ethics report 395 to 28, with 196 Republicans supporting it.\n\nNow on to the articles Gingrich cited. Neither publication said he was cleared on all ethics counts. However, an opinion article in The Wall Street Journal said that a formal IRS investigation in 1999 \"exonerated Mr. Gingrich.\" We found a similar claim in the National Review.\n\nNews accounts tell a different story.\n\nThe House ethics committee left it to the IRS to determine whether there were violations of tax laws. It cleared the Progress and Freedom Foundation of accusations that it violated its tax-exempt status in 1999.\n\nThe IRS described its decision as a \"close case,\" according to news accounts. It accused the ethics committee of failing to turn over crucial transcripts.\n\n\"It is possible that if the ethics committee had rendered full cooperation with our examination, the transcripts might have affected our conclusion,\" the decision said. \u00a0\n\nNews accounts from the Los Angeles Times and The New York Times said that the IRS did not directly exonerate Gingrich.\n\nThe IRS did find the Lincoln foundation was involved in partisan efforts to train Republican political activists. It lost its tax-exempt status in December 1998, and the decision was upheld in federal court, according to an article in Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call.\n\nBut the IRS restored its tax-exempt status in 2003 through a little-known review process, according to Roll Call.\n\nCritics said the move opened the IRS to accusations that it was swayed by political influence, and the process was soon abolished, according to Roll Call. The IRS did not say at the time whether the Lincoln foundation controversy was a factor.\n\nAn IRS letter restoring the Lincoln foundation\u2019s tax-exempt status does not say whether the group was cleared of engaging in partisan activity.\n\nNo, Gingrich was not \"exonerated in every single case,\" as he said during the Boortz show. There is no doubt that the full House of Representatives voted to formally reprimand him for his conduct, and he was required to pay a $300,000 penalty. \u00a0\n\nFurthermore, the IRS\u2019 treatment of the Progress and Freedom Foundation and the Abraham Lincoln Opportunity Foundation don\u2019t clear him, either. One was cleared -- with a caveat the IRS was unable to obtain important evidence.\n\nEven if both groups were cleared, that would not blot out or negate the House of Representatives\u2019 historic decision to reprimand him.

Nine states and the District of Columbia have laws that require a waiting period for purchases of at least some types of guns, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\nThere is currently no federal waiting period for gun sales.

{"label": "pants-fire", "claim": "Jon Huntsman \"The IRS is already planning on 19,500 new employees to administer\" Obama\u2019s health care mandate.", "evidence": "During the Bloomberg-Washington Post debate at Dartmouth College Oct. 11, 2011, presidential hopeful Jon Huntsman took his turn taking shots at President Barack Obama\u2019s health care bill along with the other seven GOP front runners.\n\u00a0\nWhen Rick Santorum declared that repealing Obamacare would boost job creation, Herman Cain, Mitt Romney and Huntsman each shared ways to get the federal mandate off the table. Cain and Huntsman joined Santorum\u2019s attack against Romney\u2019s suggested waivers, which they said, would not do the trick.\n\n\"It's disingenuous to -- to just say that you can -- you can waive it all away,\" Huntsman said. \"The mandate will be in place. The IRS is already planning on 19,500 new employees to administer that mandate. That will stay, and that's the ruinous part of Obamacare.\"\n\nHuntsman's claim that the Internal Revenue Service planned to hire 19,500 new employees caught our attention, and his logic seemed similar to claims we\u2019ve checked before. We decided to look into Huntsman\u2019s interpretation to see how his figures compared.\n\nFirst, we contacted Huntsman\u2019s campaign to find out where he got his numbers, but spokesman Tim Miller said the campaign researcher could not be reached by our deadline.\n\nFortunately, both PolitiFact National and PolitiFact Georgia had reviewed similar claims. FactCheck.org, a nonprofit fact-checking team, has also done similar checks.\n\nPolitiFact National first checked U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk, R-Ill.,who was involved in early fights over the health care legislation. Kirk said at the time, \"according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the IRS would need to hire over 16,000 people ... to audit the American people and impose the new taxes and mandates\" of the health care bill.\n\nKirk\u2019s attribution was misleading, PolitiFact ruled, as the 16,500 Kirk cited actually came from an estimation made by Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee, which handles federal tax legislation. The CBO, a nonpartisan referee on budget questions, actually offered a cost estimate of $5 billion to $10 billion over 10 years but did not suggest how those costs would translate into IRS jobs. Republicans picked the high end of the CBO estimate and then estimated the numbers of employees from there in order to favor their case, PolitiFact found. Republicans on Ways and Means even acknowledged that their figure could be less than 16,500 new jobs if factoring in overhead costs including desks and office supplies in addition to salaries. Kirk got a Mostly False from PolitiFact National.\n\nA similar assertion about hiring new agents came up when Republican Rep. Ron Paul of Texas said it would take \"16,500 armed bureaucrats to make this program work.\" FactCheck.org, who researched Paul\u2019s statement, noted Paul had mischaracterized what the Ways and Means Republicans had said about number of potential IRS employees. IRS agents actually make up a small percentage of the total IRS workforce, while clerks, accountants, administrators, attorneys, help-line workers and other non-enforcement employees, make up the bulk. Only a minor portion of IRS agents are armed law enforcement officers who work on criminal cases. FactCheck.org called Paul\u2019s statement a \"wildly inaccurate claim.\" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPolitiFact National again ruled on a similar IRS agent claim made by U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, but gave her a better Truth-O-Meter rating than Kirk. Bachmann chose to say the health care bill \"may\" put those agents in charge of policing the bill--not that they would--which earned her a Half True.\n\nSince Bachmann\u2019s statement, the IRS submitted a budget request to the U.S. Department of the Treasury for fiscal year 2012 that includes estimates for workers needed to begin implementing the health care bill. PolitiFact read the 159-page budget request and found requests for 1,269 employees to prepare for the health care tax changes, at a cost of $473.4 million. But most of the requests were made for IRS support roles such as information technology or customer service. Few were for agents.\n\nSo when PolitiFact Georgia joined the party to rule on a statement made by Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., -- that the IRS estimated it must hire \"16,500 agents at a cost of $10 billion to the taxpayer\" to enforce the federal health care overhaul - -Chambliss got a False. No, not an IRS estimate. No, not agents. And no, not 16,500.\n\nFinally, if we turn to Huntsman\u2019s assertion during the debate that 19,500 employees will be needed to administer Obama\u2019s health care mandate, we find it contains problems similar to previous claims we checked. Huntsman started a little more on target than some of his Truth-O-Meter predecessors, but his claim recycles misinterpreted numbers once again.\n\nHuntsman\u2019s claim estimates the IRS employees, rather than IRS agents, that will be tied to the health care bill. But Huntsman exaggerates when he says the IRS plans for almost 20,000 employees to administer the mandate. Really it was Ways and Means Committee Republicans, taking only the high end of the CBO's cost predictions, which floated the 16,500 employee number, while admitting they didn\u2019t calculate overhead costs to offset those numbers.\n\nAnd since the IRS\u2019 own budget request estimates about 1,300 new employees in 2012 to administer the health care bill, mostly in non-enforcement roles, Huntsman\u2019s 19,500 employee estimate is a new extreme for this claim. Not only does Huntsman repeat it wrongly, attributing it to the IRS, he kicks up figures that have been repeatedly debunked.\n\n"}

The shorter,\u00a030-second\u00a0version gives a taste of the attack, specifically citing abortion and health care, and directs viewers to a website with\u00a0a\u00a0four-minute version that offers alleged flip-flops on a variety of other issues.\n\nFor this item, we\u2019ll check one of the claims from the four-minute version -- specifically, whether Romney has changed his position on an assault weapons ban. We're looking at other aspects of the ad in separate items.\n\nHere\u2019s the relevant portion from the DNC ad:\n\nScreen text: For assault weapons ban\n\nVideo clip of Romney speaking: \"I just signed a piece of legislation extending the ban on certain assault weapons.\"\n\nScreen text: Against assault weapons ban\n\nVideo clip of Romney speaking: \"I do not support any new legislation of an assault weapon ban nature.\"\n\nWe previously ruled Mostly True a charge by Republican candidate Jon Huntsman that Romney flip-flopped on gun control. But Huntsman\u2019s charge was broader than the DNC\u2019s, so we\u2019ll take a look specifically at Romney\u2019s views on assault-weapons bans.\n\nUsing supporting material provided by the DNC, we went to the sources of both clips in the ad. The first clip came from the Aug. 4, 2004, edition of the Fox News program Hannity and Colmes. That interview was conducted roughly\u00a0halfway through Romney\u2019s single term as governor of Massachusetts. The second clip came from a Republican presidential debate held on Jan. 24, 2008, in Boca Raton, Fla. By then, Romney had left the governor\u2019s office and was running for president.\n\nUpon reviewing this material, we find that the DNC\u2019s choices for the specific quote and counter-quote in the ad are problematic. But we also found that other evidence not cited in the ad provides support for the notion that Romney has taken muddled positions on Second Amendment issues.\n\nThe Massachusetts bill\n\nAs we evaluate this claim, it\u2019s important to know that when he was governor, Romney signed legislation that extended\u00a0an existing assault weapons ban in Massachusetts.\n\nThe 2004 bill enacted a permanent ban on assault weapons -- reportedly the first such state law in the country. \"These guns are not made for recreation or self-defense,\" the Boston Globe quoted Romney as saying at the time. \"They are instruments of destruction with the sole purpose of hunting down and killing people.\"\n\nDespite the assault-weapons provision -- usually a deal-breaker for gun-rights groups -- the measure received support from pro-gun groups because other provisions lengthened the terms of firearm ID cards and licenses to carry\u00a0firearms. On more than one occasion, Romney described the bill as a \"consensus\" measure.\n\nThe 2004 interview\n\n"}

We reached out to Berenson by email, but he did not respond. However, in a related Twitter thread, Berenson went on to discuss a study conducted in Israel that looked at six shingles cases occurring post-vaccination in a group of about 500 people with immune disorders.\nThe small Israeli study drew wide attention on social media and other outlets, and currently is the most-read article in the British Medical Journal\u2019s Rheumatology. Some outlets, including the New York Post, ran stories on its findings, often with misleading headlines.\nThat got us wondering: How strong is the science behind this connection?\nFirst, a little background\nShingles, also called herpes zoster, occurs in people who had chickenpox, a virus that causes itchy blisters. (Shingles can be prevented by the two-dose Shingrix vaccine.)\nAfter a person recovers from chickenpox, the varicella-zoster virus that causes it can lie dormant in the body, and then reactivate years or decades later in the form of shingles. Both are part of the herpes virus family, which includes herpes simplex Types 1 and 2.\nType 1 commonly causes \"cold\" sores around the mouth and lips and is spread by kissing or sharing things like toothbrushes. Type 2 can cause genital herpes, which is spread via sexual contact.\nAmong the things that can reactivate these dormant herpes viruses are stress, drugs that suppress the immune system or simply aging.\nNow, back to those social media posts\nNeither the picture of the man with a rash or the findings of the small study in Israel prove cause and effect. In other words, just because a rash follows a vaccine by days or weeks does not mean the vaccine caused the rash.\nDr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said it\u2019s natural for people to link events that occur within a short span of time, but he stressed it doesn\u2019t prove causality.\n\"Just because B follows A doesn\u2019t mean A causes B,\" he said.\nIn considering whether there are links between a treatment and a side effect, researchers often follow two large groups of similar people, one group getting a particular medication or vaccine, the other not. If the vaccinated or medicated individuals experience a side effect at a greater rate than those not treated, there may be a connection.\nSafety is also monitored by tracking data on reported side effects.\n\n"}

One claim by incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen caught our eye. Shaheen is facing a challenge from former Republican Sen. Scott Brown.\nIn a news release from her campaign, Shaheen said:\n\"I have always supported a woman\u2019s right to choose because I know women should be making health care decisions in consultation with their doctors and their families, not their employer. Scott Brown\u2019s record is clear: When it counts, he doesn\u2019t stand up for women\u2019s reproductive rights and economic security. He co-sponsored legislation to let employers deny women coverage for birth control or even mammograms. New Hampshire women can\u2019t trust Scott Brown, and his record is move evidence that he is wrong for New Hampshire.\"\nWe noticed two claims that are related, but distinct enough to analyze separately. First, would the legislation in question have allowed employers deny women coverage for birth control? And would it have allowed employers to deny coverage for mammograms?\nWe\u2019ve heard of controversies over birth control, but not mammograms. So we decided to check it out. (We\u2019ve addressed birth control in a separate fact-check.)\nMammograms are used to screen for breast cancer, either preventively in women who have no signs of the disease, or as a diagnostic aid after a lump or other symptom is reported, according to the National Cancer Institute.\nIn a different Shaheen campaign news release, the campaign explained its sourcing by writing, \"FACT: Scott Brown both co-sponsored and voted for the Blunt Amendment that would let employers deny women access to a range of healthcare services, including contraception and coverage for mammograms.\"\nThe amendment in question was proposed by Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo. It was tabled -- that is, dispensed with -- by a 51-48 vote in which a simple majority was required. Among those who voted \"nay\" -- that is, those who wanted to keep it under consideration -- was Brown, then representing Massachusetts in the Senate. He also co-sponsored a predecessor measure, S.1467, the Respect for Rights of Conscience Act of 2011.\nSo Shaheen\u2019s camp is correct that Brown acted in support of this measure. But what did the amendment say? It acted to widen the scope of acceptable actions for opting out of provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on religious or moral grounds. It focuses on mandates within the law for preventive services, called the \"essential health benefits package.\"\nThe Shaheen campaign pointed us to a Feb. 29, 2014, news release opposing the Blunt Amendment by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. The release said, \"the expansive nature of the proposed Blunt amendment ... could result in coverage denials of life-saving preventive services such as mammograms or tobacco cessation based on employer discretion.\"\nBut we aren\u2019t accepting the claim of an advocacy group without digging further. So we read the relevant portions of the law ourselves.\nWe agree that the provision is drawn broadly. It\u2019s not targeted at abortion or birth control -- it simply says that employers cannot be required to cover \"specific items or services\" that are \"contrary to the religious beliefs or moral convictions of the sponsor, issuer, or other entity offering the plan.\"\nSo, presumably, any aspect of preventive care could qualify for a religious-conscience opt-out -- including mammograms. Or, for that matter, stethoscopes or tongue depressors.\nWe can\u2019t imagine any religious objections to the use of tongue depressors. But what about mammograms?\n\n"}

PolitiFact has examined that growth spurt several times and found it was because of temporary 2010 Census hiring, long-planned and independent of any White House action.\n\n\n\nBy October 2010, the number of federal workers had dropped to 2.86 million and by May 2012, the most recent most available, it was projected to be 2.819 million.\n\n\nThe number has dropped slowly every single month since March 2011.\n\nYou can assess this a couple of ways. The trend for more than a year has been downward, while the net number since the stimulus passed in early 2009 is up -- by 24,000.\n\nYet Portman\u2019s point was clear: that the proper way to grow the economy is through private sector jobs, not public sector jobs. He didn\u2019t say federal jobs have inched upward. He said they have grown \"pretty substantially.\"\n\nHow big is substantial?\n\nFederal employment on net has grown by less than 1 percent since the stimulus passed, BLS data and our calculator show.\n\nHis characterization of state and local government employment is correct. State employment fell from 5.188 million workers when the stimulus passed to 5.073 million in May, or by 115,000 jobs.\n\nAt the local government level, cities, towns, townships and counties dropped overall employment from 14.594 million when the stimulus passed to 14.077 million in May, a loss of 517,000 jobs.\n\nThe losses came as local and state governments cut their payrolls in response to lower tax collections -- itself a result of the weak economy.\n\nAs for federal employment, the subject of Portman\u2019s claim, it \u00a0shows a net growth in the three-plus years since the stimulus passed, but that growth is modest at best, and it is now trending downward month after month. Characterizing a net increase of less than 1 percent as substantial is inaccurate"}

Scott Walker, a contender on the GOP side of the field. Cheering him on was an Alliant Energy Center crowd that his aides estimated at \u00a0nearly 10,000 people.\nAt one point during his hourlong speech on July 1, 2015, Sanders said:\n\"The issue of wealth and income inequality, to my mind, is the great moral issue of our time. It is the great economic issue of our time and it is the great political issue of our time.\n\"Let me be as clear as I can be: There is something profoundly wrong when today, the top one-tenth of 1 percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.\"\nWealth inequality is sure to be an issue Sanders emphasizes as he challenges Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination.\nSo, does the top one-tenth of 1 percent of Americans own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent?\nPrevious claims\nTwo of our most-clicked fact checks have found significant gaps in wealth in the United States.\nFilmmaker Michael Moore -- also speaking in Madison, during the height of protests against Walker over his collective bargaining reforms in 2011 -- said 400 Americans have more wealth than half of all Americans combined. Our rating was True. As of 2010, the net worth of the Forbes 400 -- $1.37 trillion -- exceeded that of the poorest 60 percent of U.S. households.\nWe also rated True a 2013 statement by the liberal One Wisconsin Now advocacy group, which said the wealth of the Wal-Mart Walton family equalled the wealth of the bottom 42 percent of Americans combined. The wealth of Sam Walton\u2019s heirs, we found, was $89.5 billion -- equal to the bottom 42 percent of American families. \u00a0\nA note about those fact checks, in terms of helping explain the wealth gap: Many Americans make a good income, have some savings and investments, and own a nice home; they also have debt, for a mortgage, credit cards and other bills. Some people would still have a pretty healthy bottom line, but still have a negative net worth.\nMeanwhile, so far in 2015, PolitiFact National has given Sanders a Mostly True\u00a0for saying income equality in the U.S. is the widest since the 1920s; and a Mostly True for saying 99 percent of all new income is \"going to the top 1 percent.\"\nNow to his new claim, which is about wealth, rather than income.\nSanders\u2019 evidence\nTo back Sanders\u2019 statement, his Senate office cited a news article from The Guardian newspaper. The headline on the article, which reported on a wealth inequality study released in October 2014, matched Sanders\u2019 claim nearly word for word.\n\n"}
{"label": "true", "claim": "Karen Handel \"The truth is, Planned Parenthood does not provide mammograms. Planned Parenthood refers women to mammography providers, serving as the middlewoman, if you will.\"", "evidence": "Former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel came out firing on all cylinders in her book, \"Planned Bullyhood.\"\n\nHandel, who most recently served as the former vice president of public policy at Susan G. Komen for the Cure, included criticisms of Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, state politics and decisions at Komen.\n\nIncluded in the book is a detailed account of this year\u2019s much-publicized controversy at the breast cancer nonprofit organization. In early February, Komen announced it would no longer make grants to organizations that were under local, state or federal investigation. Planned Parenthood, which received more than $600,000 annually from Komen to perform breast examinations and conduct breast health education at 19 of its centers, was facing an investigation by Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., into whether the organization had violated a prohibition against using federal funds for abortion services. After a firestorm of criticism, Komen reversed its decision, and Handel resigned less than a week later.\n\nSome critics suggested Handel was behind Komen\u2019s policy decision. But in her book, Handel says Komen had considered ending the relationship with Planned Parenthood \"for at least a decade,\" as Komen restructured its grant model to focus on measurable outcomes to fighting breast cancer. That focus, she said, excluded much of what Planned Parenthood did.\n\nIn her book, Handel makes pointed statements regarding Planned Parenthood\u2019s services, noting that the organization promoted itself as a provider of mammograms to poor women. \u00a0\n\n\"The truth is, Planned Parenthood does not provide mammograms,\" she wrote. \"Planned Parenthood refers women to mammography providers, serving as the middlewoman, if you will.\"\n\nWe wondered whether this was true of the organization known for being a key player in women\u2019s health issues. Does Planned Parenthood really not provide mammograms? And, if not, how does the organization handle the services? And does it receive or provide funding for the work?\n\nThe argument over mammography and other services at Planned Parenthood has been ongoing for several years. Much of the debate centers on a congressional push last year to cut funding to Planned Parenthood, which has been cited as the country\u2019s leading abortion provider. The federal government pays Planned Parenthood about $75 million a year to offer cancer screenings, breast exams and other care to lower-income women. That money cannot be spent on abortion services. The funding cut, which passed the House, was shot down in the Senate. \n\nOrganization President Cecile Richards denounced the cuts in February 2011 on HLN\u2019s \"The Joy Behar Show.\" During that interview, Richards said that if the bill to cut funding ever became law, millions of women in the country would lose access to health care, not to abortion services but to basic family planning services, such as mammograms and cancer screenings. \n\nRichards was immediately challenged on her statement by the California-based anti-abortion group Live Action, which secretly recorded phone conversations between an actress and employees at various Planned Parenthood clinics. The actress, supposedly seeking a mammogram, was told the service was not available and in some cases was referred elsewhere. Richards said her comments on Behar\u2019s show were taken out of context.\n\nSo are mammograms on Planned Parenthood\u2019s service menu? \n\nWe asked, and in an email response, a spokeswoman for the organization said doctors and nurses at Planned Parenthood health centers provide clinical breast exams and refer patients to facilities with technicians for mammograms based on breast exams, age or family history. Planned Parenthood also refers women to breast specialists when a potential abnormality is found and follow-up tests are needed. And with the organization\u2019s expanded breast health initiative, Planned Parenthood will be able to cover the cost of this specialized care for more women, the email said.\n\nHandel\u2019s statement that Planned Parenthood doesn\u2019t provide mammograms and only refers clients for those services at other facilities is supported by the organization itself"}

The 1,033 total for Huckabee's 10 years in office comes from an Associated Press examination of Huckabee's pardons and commutations. The Arkansas Secretary of State's office told PolitiFact the count was 1,058, which is not significantly different. Romney's claim that Huckabee granted more clemencies \"than the previous three governors combined\" also is correct according to the totals from the Secretary of State.\n\n\nState officials in Massachusetts confirm Romney's record. He had about 150 applications for pardons and 80 applications for commuting sentences in his four-year term. He granted none.\n\n\nThe result is a striking difference: Huckabee has granted more than 1,000, while Romney hasn't granted any (although he has said he would consider pardoning White House aide Scooter Libby because the case involved an overzealous prosecutor).\n\n\nHuckabee, a Baptist minister, says he was trying to give a second chance to people who had been convicted of minor crimes.\n\n\n\"A lot of (the pardons) that I gave were for 35-year-old single moms with kids who wanted to get a job anywhere in a nursing home emptying a bed pan, but because of the background check couldn't because when they were 18 they'd written a hot check,\" he said in a Dec. 19 interview on MSNBC's\n\nMorning Joe.\n\n\n\n"}

He recounted how it was the \"worst foreign attack in our history since the War of 1812\" and how Trump\u2019s running mate, Mike Pence, visited \"Ground Zero when we were in desperate need of help.\"\nStill, Giuliani seemed to throw everything he had just said out the window: \"By the way, under those eight years before Obama came along, we didn\u2019t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack in the United States. They all started when Clinton and Obama got into office.\"\nBack in 2010, Giuliani made a similar gaffe when he claimed, \"We had no domestic attacks under (President George W.) Bush.\" He later apologized for misspeaking and not adding the words, \"since Sept. 11.\"\nGiuliani apparently made the same mistake again, telling the New York Daily News that he was just using \"abbreviated language.\"\nBut even barring 9/11, Giuliani is omitting several successful attacks on U.S. soil. Some are undoubtedly jihad-linked while the connection to \"radical Islamic extremism\" is murkier in others.\nThe New America Foundation, for example, compiles a comprehensive list of terrorist plots, but its definition of \"violent jihadist attacks\" does not necessarily match up with law enforcement classification.\nThat\u2019s because strict definitions like \"hate crime\" or \"terrorist attack\" may be useful for prosecuting cases, but they may cloud the public\u2019s understanding of what the attack was and what motivated the crimes \u2014 \"questions to which answers are rarely linear or packaged into a neat explanation,\" said Albert Ford, a research assistant at New America.\nThat being said, let\u2019s go through successful attacks on U.S. soil in which ideology played some role.\n2002 Los Angeles Airport shooting \u00a0\n\n"}

Author Malcolm Harris wrote, \"If current trends continue, the Department of Education estimates that by 2014 there will be more administrators than instructors at American four-year nonprofit colleges.\"\n\nWhen we contacted Harris for his source, he pointed us to a study by the Center for College Affordability and Productivity, a Washington-based group that studies \"the rising costs and stagnant efficiency in higher education.\"\n\nThe report said, \"The growth of non-instructional staff is so fast that if these job growth trends were to continue, the number of managers and support staff (administration) at four-year, not-for-profit colleges would outnumber instructors by 2014. Using the average annual percentage increase between 1997 and 2007 for each of the three job categories (managers, support staff and instructors) as the respective rate of growth, and combining support staff and managers into one category as administration.\"\n\nTo back up this finding, the report cited statistics culled from the Integrated Post-secondary Education Data System, a database produced by the Department of Education.\n\nSo Gingrich has some support for his claim.\n\nAn important caveat is that different people may use a different definition of \"administrator\" in the college setting. In the Center for College Affordability and Productivity study, \"administrator\" refers to the aggregate of \"executive, administrative, and managerial\" positions and \"other professional staff,\" including support staff.

Bennett, research fellow at the Center for College Affordability and Productivity\n\nThe author of the Washington Monthly article, Johns Hopkins University political scientist Benjamin Ginsberg, wrote that if universities gave faculty members more influence and let them handle more administrative work in addition to teaching, \"more resources might be available for educational programs and student support, the actual items for which parents, donors, and funding agencies think they are paying.\"\n\nA final point: Much of the teaching load at universities today is handled by graduate students rather than faculty members.\n\nOur ruling\n\nGingrich said during the debate that \"by 2014, there will be one administrator for every teacher on college campuses in the United States.\" A study by the Center for College Affordability and Productivity backs up that claim.

In other words, there are a lot of ways to slice the numbers.\nFor the purposes of this fact-check, we are specifically looking at Obama's statement. And while there are several organizations that track terrorism cases, administration officials said Obama got his 190 figure from a report by Human Rights First, a nonpartisan international human rights organization based in New York and Washington, D.C.

Could it be that Texas will have more money in its rainy day fund than all other states combined?\nWe emailed Patrick\u2019s office to seek the basis of his statement and to gauge if he was trying to make an uncheckable prediction\u2014rather than a flat factual statement. We also looked for the latest information on each state\u2019s expected fiscal-year-end reserves.\nThe Texas state comptroller, Glenn Hegar, issued his two-year state revenue forecast in January 2015. Hegar said the state\u2019s rainy day fund will have a balance of nearly $8.5 billion when fiscal 2015 ends Aug. 31, 2015. Hegar projected the fund to grow to $9.8 billion a year later and to $11 billion through August 2017.\nPer Patrick\u2019s statement, then, all the other states together should be expecting to end their 2015 fiscal years with less than $8.5 billion, combined.\nTexas, Alaska outpace other states\nAn online search led us to a fall 2014 report by the National Association of State Budget Officers initially making us think Patrick was onto something. In the report, The Fiscal Survey of States, a section headlined \"Year-End Balances\" said that generally, states have made progress rebuilding budgetary reserves since revenues plummeted during the Great Recession of 2009-10. State budgets passed into law for the 2015 fiscal year show reserve balances nationally totaling $53.1 billion, the report said. And, the report said, \"a disproportionate share of state budget reserves are concentrated in Alaska and Texas, which account for $20.6 billion or 38.8 percent of states reported total balances in fiscal 2015.\"\nPew official\nFor more perspective, we sought guidance from the Pew Charitable Trusts, which in July 2014 issued a report on how states might build rainy day funds.

{"label": "true", "claim": "Eric Kearney An effort to repeal voting-reform legislation would be \"the first time in Ohio history where a bill has been passed to stop a referendum.\"", "evidence": "A bill to reform Ohio election laws, House Bill 194, has been a consistent source of controversy since it was introduced last year.\n\nThe latest flap came on March 28 when the Ohio Senate passed a bill to repeal the law, which Democrats and others have called a \"voter suppression\" bill.\n\nAlthough they oppose HB 194, largely because it restricts early voting opportunities, Democrats also spoke out against the bill\u2019s repeal because there already is a referendum on HB 194 scheduled for this fall\u2019s ballot.\n\nSen. Eric Kearney, who leads the Senate\u2019s Democratic caucus, said voters have the right to decide the fate HB 194. He said Republicans were unconstitutionally taking away their right to referendum by repealing the law before the election on Nov. 6.\n\n\"This is the first time in Ohio history where a bill has been passed to stop a referendum,\" Kearney, of Cincinnati, said during the floor debate March 28.\n\nThe GOP-controlled Senate passed the bill to repeal HB 194 on a party-line vote that day, sending the bill to the House of Representatives for consideration.\n\nAnytime an elected official utters the words \"this is the first time in Ohio history,\" we at PolitiFact Ohio become instantly curious. So we decided to dig into Kearney\u2019s claim.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s important to recognize that the legislation passed last month, Senate Bill 295, does not directly stop the referendum on HB 194. It essentially nullifies the referendum because it repeals the law, therefore there would be no law to put before voters.\n\nKearney\u2019s larger point \u2013 that repealing HB 194 before the referendum vote is unconstitutional \u2013 is ripe for debate and, many lawmakers agree, likely will be decided in court if the House also passes SB 295 and the governor signs it.\n\nAn attempt to verify Kearney\u2019s assertion that the repeal is unprecedented could help shed light on the situation. If the senator is wrong, a similar case could help answer the question of the repeal\u2019s constitutionality.\n\nWe checked with several government and legal sources and could not find an identical situation in Ohio\u2019s history.\n\nThe provision to allow Ohioans to challenge a law passed by the General Assembly was included in the Ohio Constitution in 1912, according to a history of ballot issues maintained by the Secretary of State\u2019s office.\n\nMike Rowe, spokesman for the Senate Democratic caucus, said the caucus\u2019 legal staff could not find a similar case despite research that looked at the Ohio Revised Code, legislative records and discussions with staff members.\n\nRepublicans in the Senate and House also came up empty.\n\nSenate GOP spokeswoman Angela Meleca said the caucus\u2019 legal staff, along with the Ohio Legislative Services Commission, looked back and could not find another case of the General Assembly repealing a bill that is up for a referendum.\n\n\"There was nothing that matched or fit this scenario,\" Meleca said.\n\nCarrie Davis, executive director of the League of Women Voters of Ohio, testified before a Senate committee on March 21 that the Ohio Supreme Court had never addressed the question of repealing a bill up for a referendum.\n\n\"If we\u2019re all hitting the same wall and not finding anything, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s there,\" Davis said in an interview.\n\nThere was one case with similarities, but it fell short of exactly matching the repeal of HB 194.\n\nLawmakers passed a bill last year to establish new congressional districts. The legislation replaced districts established by an earlier bill, House Bill 319, that spurred a referendum effort backed by Democrats. But when the second bill, House Bill 369, passed with a new map, the referendum effort ceased because the new maps replaced the old ones involved in the referendum.\n\nThe partial repeal of HB 319 is different, though, because Democrats dropped their bid to collect the signatures needed to get a referendum on the ballot. In the case of HB 194, Secretary of State Jon Husted last year certified that petitioners met the requirements to place the referendum on the November ballot.\n\nSo Kearney appears to be on solid ground. But it is important to remember the bill to repeal HB 194 has not been passed in the House. So the repeal is not official yet, although Republican House Speaker William G. Batchelder supports it.\n\nNevertheless, the experts we talked to all agreed that Kearney\u2019s point that the repeal would be a first in Ohio history is accurate"}

{"label": "false", "claim": "Chain email The salaries of Wisconsin\u2019s best-educated public school teachers were \"slashed\" by Gov. Scott Walker through a recent administrative rule change.", "evidence": "Under Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s 2011 changes to curtail collective bargaining for most public employees, teachers and many other public workers are now paying more for pensions and health care.\n\nBut a chain email making the rounds alleges that Walker quietly -- and drastically -- cut salaries even more for the best-educated teachers in April 2012 with the stroke of a pen that changed an administrative rule.\n\nThe claim made the rounds after a highly confusing episode in which Walker reshaped a rule, thereby lowering by some 30 percent the inflation-based raises that public unions can negotiate under Act 10, which included Walker\u2019s limits on unions.\n\nThe rule change would not use an individual's actual salary as a \"base salary\" to calculate raises and would exclude factors such as whether a teacher has a graduate degree, the Journal Sentinel reported on April 20, 2012.\n\nDays later, the chain email began -- subject line: Scott Walker and Max teacher Pay -- making the rounds. It echoed allegations by a top labor leader, Marty Beil, that Walker\u2019s rule went even further -- actually drastically cutting the base salaries in question.\n\nReaders asked us to get to the bottom of the email, which began:\n\n\"I have some heart-stopping news that I believe has devastating\nconsequences for all active and retired public employees.\"\n\nThe email said the rule would prohibit school districts from including add-on pay for advanced degrees in the wage scales written into any of its labor contracts. It claimed teachers would be hit the hardest, even providing an example -- Sarah Teacher.\n\n\"Let\u2019s say Sarah Teacher has a Masters degree, 24 hours of college credit and 12 years experience. The most Sarah can be paid under her current contract is $52,927.\n\n\"Under the new rule, the maximum Sarah will be able to earn in future contracts is $38,167, the maximum for a teacher who has the minimum educational requirements but many years of experience.\"\n\nThe email claimed Sarah Teacher's salary will be \"slashed by a third\" -- perhaps even more as cash-strapped districts squeeze staff even tighter.\n\nWhat\u2019s really going on?\n\nWalker\u2019s union legislation blocks school districts from including educational add-on pay in labor contracts. So it wasn\u2019t the more recent rule change that did that.\n\nIn addition, there is no dispute the rule change limits the size of the pool for wage increases that school districts and unions will negotiate over.\n\nSo, in this item, we\u2019ll focus on the heart of the email\u2019s claim -- that Walker\u2019s action mandated big pay cuts for teachers.\n\nWe talked to lawyers with the employment relations commission, which approved Walker\u2019s modification of the rule. We also consulted with a labor lawyer and examined statements by labor officials.\n\nThey all agreed: The rule does not cut the current wages of teachers -- or require or direct that to happen.\n\nThe power to set salaries lies with local school districts, not Walker or the employment relations commission.\n\nSome argue the rule makes it much easier for local districts to make big cuts.\n\nThis comes down to where the starting point is set for public employees. Act 10 prohibited bargaining over pay schedules -- those grids that award teachers additional pay based on higher education and seniority. It left intact bargaining over inflationary increases to base wages -- the salary level not including educational bonuses and other add-ons.\n\nThe first version of the rule -- before Walker\u2019s changes -- made clear that a teacher\u2019s current total salary would be the starting point.\n\nWalker\u2019s changes in the rule put that in doubt, with experts disagreeing on how this will play out.\n\nSome say the new rule makes it easier for school officials to cut into existing salaries without any collective bargaining.\n\nBut they say districts also will be free -- outside of narrow labor talks on inflationary raises -- to give teachers additional pay for higher education outside any labor contract. That could make teachers \"whole\" if districts chose on their own, outside of labor talks, to honor previous pay for higher education.\n\nThe other camp says the new rule does not mean current salaries can be ignored when unions sit down with management to discuss wages.\n\nEventually, the employment relations commission or a court will likely have to settle that issue, which also affects technical college teachers.\n\nOur conclusion\n\nA chain email says an administrative rule modified by Gov. Scott Walker amounted to him slashing teacher salaries.\n\nWe can\u2019t predict the future, so there is no way to know how individual districts will approach teacher pay in the years ahead under this rule and Act 10.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear that the rule Walker reshaped does not give him authority over base pay, and does not mandate pay cuts for teachers"}

Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., to raise a pet issue on MSNBC: antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\nThe federal shutdown was limiting government\u2019s ability to track infection, she said. But then she pointed to a deeper issue: \"the overuse and ruination of antibiotics.\"\nAn advocate for tougher requirements for farm use of such drugs, Slaughter told host Joy-Ann Reid that she\u2019s been \"trying to save antibiotics for persons \u2014 for human beings.\"\n\"Eighty percent of the antibiotics in this country are fed to livestock every single day, and it's creating a terrible problem of resistant bacteria,\" she said.\nEighty percent is an awfully big number, and we were curious: Do livestock consume the bulk of the nation\u2019s antimicrobial drugs?\nIt\u2019s an important question, because according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wide use of antibiotics in food-producing animals \"contributes to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in food-producing animals.\"\nEmergence of resistant bacteria means if you get infected with bacteria from the food you eat, it might be harder to fight that infection with antibiotics. Drug resistance may be contributing to higher hospitalization rates in the recent salmonella outbreak, for example, the Los Angeles Times reported.\nHere\u2019s how it works, according to the CDC: Ranchers give animals antibiotics, which kills off or suppresses susceptible bacteria, but allows antibiotic-resistant bacteria to thrive. Those resistant bacteria may be transmitted to people through the food supply, such as by eating undercooked salmonella-tainted chicken. Since the bacteria are resistant to some antibiotics, the infections may be harder to fight, causing \"adverse human health consequences.\"\nSo CDC \"encourages and supports efforts to minimize inappropriate use of antibiotics in humans and animals.\"\nYou\u2019re probably aware of this effort in humans \u2014 it\u2019s why doctors are discouraged from giving their patients antibiotics to treat nonbacterial infections such as cold and flu. Widespread use of antibiotics when they\u2019re not required helps bacteria develop defenses to the drugs in a sort of microscopic arms race.\nIt\u2019s also the reason the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has asked farmers to phase out certain antibiotics important to human medicine when used merely to promote growth in animals. (The industry says this accounts for a small amount of antibiotic use. The FDA says it\u2019s hard to say.)\nSo, back to the 80 percent number. It turns out it has been a popular talking point since 2010 among those who advocate for restricting use of antibiotics on farms. That\u2019s the year the FDA released newly required data on sales of antibiotics by manufacturers for food-producing animals. The FDA didn\u2019t release sales information on antibiotics for human use, but pointed to national projections from IMS Health, a Connecticut company that compiles proprietary health data.\nThe numbers let folks compare the millions of kilograms of drugs sold by manufacturers for use by food-producing animals (13.1 million kilograms) in 2009 with those sold for use by people (3.3 million kilograms). The 13.1 million kilograms of antibiotics sold for animals was 80 percent of the total amount of drugs sold for both humans and animals, which was 16.4 million kilograms.\nWe should note this comparison doesn\u2019t account for all antibiotics sold in the United States. For example, it doesn\u2019t count antibiotics sold for household pets.\nA researcher with the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health\u2019s Center for a Livable Future first did the math for a 2010 blog post that\u2019s been widely cited.
