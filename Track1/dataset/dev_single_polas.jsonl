{"label": 1.6667, "text": "I feel like it's already too late. The damage is done.. i would not accept it at all!"}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "Yeah I agree. It makes me wonder why she even agreed to see her mother on the show? Maybe she just wanted some answers."}

{"label": 1.6667, "text": "Yeah, what are the odds you go to get fuel and the tanker blows up."}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "It's pretty slim. I feel so bad for the families of the ones that were lost."}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "Me too, and it sounds like they are going to find more bodies."}

{"label": 2.0, "text": "Pretty awful incident to think about."}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "Such a tragedy for the people of Mozambique."}

{"label": 1.3333, "text": "Who even expects such a thing to happen, especially when youre just going about a normal day trying to buy fuel."}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "Yes, it's crazy.  Imagine going to a gas station and having it catch on fire while you were there."}

{"label": 2.0, "text": "I feel terrible for those nearby who had to witness this."}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "Yeah, that would be horrific.  The image of people trying to run into the water while they were on fire would stick with you, like people seeing folks jump off the twin towers during 9/11.  Horrible images."}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "Very much so. And i doubt there will be any type of mental health support for the survivors."}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "Yeah, for sure.  I think I'd be hesitant to buy fuel that way in the future, even if it's incredibly unlikely that something like that happens again."}

{"label": 1.6667, "text": "I remember being in DC during the DC sniper campaign.  I remember standing and pumping my gas and thinking, \"I could get shot at any moment now.\"  Sort of surreal, but we all have to face dangers and uncertainty every day."}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "Events like this really make you ponder your own mortality."}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "For sure, and how quickly things can change.  No one could have anticipated that, and I'm sure friends and relatives will ask \"why\" for the rest of their lives."}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "There will certainly be lingering questions of why and whether it could have been prevented. Have you experienced any similar tragedies?"}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "No, nothing close to that.  I've seen some gnarly car accidents, but those you sort of understand as human error and that type of thing.  Something like this is just totally bonkers."}

{"label": 1.6667, "text": "I know - I didn't think they really knew what caused it."}

{"label": 2.0, "text": "I live in Colorado and most of our fires are caused by lightning.   We had that happen yesterday and the winds were at 65 mph.   It gets scary."}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "oh wow, that IS scary!  I mean I guess to think that one could randomly be the victim of some tragedy caused by natural forces like that is really scary.  Hurricanes and tornadoes scare me."}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "We don't have either of those but the fires just start quickly.   I live in the mountains of Colorado and fires are our biggest fear.   Difficult to get out and away."}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "Yeah that is really scary.  I live in North Carolina and fires aren't really an issue but I'm always reading about wildfires out west, it seems crazy how entire towns will be just leveled and people lose everything."}
{"label": 1.0, "text": "I know - do you live on the coast of North Carolina?"}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "No I would not do that, it's a similar situation there where they are just leveled by hurricanes regularly and sometimes they have a hard time getting out.  I'm inland.  We still get hit sometimes but it's usually not as bad.  Big trees falling on the house is a big threat and very scary but we usually get plenty of advance warning where we could leave if we wanted to."}

{"label": 1.6667, "text": "nice!  I know nothing about either one but it sounds like it was a fun experience.  Anyhow, I think the article said there were a ton of lives lost, what was it like 19 people or was it more?"}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "It said 19 but they expected to find more charred bodies.   What a terrible way to die - I think it would be horrific"}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "wouldn't it?  geez yeah, must have been painful and terrifying all in one."}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "I can't even go there - not sure what is worse - fire or drowning - I think fire would be quicker"}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "oh yeah, I can't either.  I avoid thinking about negative things like that.  Both of those sound absolutely terrible to me."}

{"label": 0.3333, "text": "Yeah, I gathered the injuries must not have been that bad"}
{"label": 1.0, "text": "I mean, it described them as \"serious\" but if they were treated on the scene they must have been serious in severity, small in size or something."}
{"label": 0.6667, "text": "Yeah good point, that seems contradictory.  But you're right, it must not have been too serious if they just treated them there and let them go."}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "Meanwhile, I'm reading it and thinking how I'm an infant about burning my tongue or the roof of my mouth, haha."}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "Oh yeah, I do not like that either.  I burn myself all the time cooking for some reason.  Burns really hurt, can't imagine having a more serious one."}
{"label": 1.0, "text": "Did the article say where the person who went to the hospital was burned? It was very vague."}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "It was very vague and short.  I do not remember if it said they were burned or not.  I'm assuming so, would have to be either that or smoke inhalation probably?"}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "Probably. I took it to mean they were burned because of the other two people having burns but being treated on scene."}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "yeah I took it the same way.  They definitely did not go into much detail.  Didn't mention the cause of the fire either, did they?"}
{"label": 0.6667, "text": "Just that the gas to the whole neighborhood got shut off. At first I thought that meant it was the gas that caused it, but thinking about it - seems like a standard operating procedure when there's a huge fire."}
{"label": 1.0, "text": "Oh yeah good point, to prevent additional fires."}
{"label": 1.0, "text": "Yeah. All it said conclusively was that the investigation was ongoing."}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "Yeah, that is so vague.  It was just like a news snippet really"}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "I don't know if that makes it easier or harder to be empathetic - on the one hand we don't know much. On the other hand, that lets our mind fill in a lot of blanks in ways that may make us feel more sympathetic towards the people involved."}

{"label": 1.6667, "text": "Yeah, they were clearly trying to influence people to join their cause for justice and animal equality."}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "That tactic is used by a lot of animal rights groups and frankly, it has the opposite effect on me personally. I'm a human being who is capable of empathy, you don't have to shove it down my throat."}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "Yeah, and I feel they're too quick to judge in instances like this.  Maybe the kitten was way into BDSM.  Maybe it died feeling unimaginable ecstasy.  Like, let's not rush to judgment here."}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "Or, maybe it was dead before it was wrapped in utility cords and abandoned. There just a lot of cruelty read into a situation without any proof."}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "For sure.  I do think they also lose credibility when they talk about things like animal \"equality.\"  Opposing cruelty is one thing, but talking about equality for all living things?  So if I swat a fly am I going to be charged with murder?  Let's get realistic or else your whole argument loses credibility."}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "I mean, Jainists take care not to harm any other living thing. They carry brooms wherever they go to sweep any insects out of their path, but most people crusading for animal rights aren't Jains, they drive cars and eat factory farmed food. I think people just like something to be outraged about; gives them purpose in a reality characterized by globalized exploitation and loss of meaning."}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "Yeah, people sure like being outraged nowadays.  It's like they prefer it.  They want to be victims of something, or see someone as a victim."}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "Or blame their problems on someone else instead of looking inward and making changes to their personality and lifestyle. Being outraged is just so much easier! Bonus! It allows me to vent the frustrations of my daily life that most likely have nothing to do with what I'm outraged about!"}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "Absolutely.  Back to the article for a second, I wonder what the penalties are for animal cruelty cases.  I assume it's just fines but I don't know.  Do you have any idea?"}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "Usually fines. You can be arrested but bond is normally set really low, ~2000 for even the most heinous acts. It's equivalent to a severe moving violation in your vehicle."}
{"label": 1.0, "text": "Yeah, I figured it would be something like that.  In this case it would be interesting to see if the citizens track down the culprit."}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "Supremely doubtful, it's not like they have the help of law enforcement or anything. They are basically going vigilante in the hopes of solving a case with no evidence or power to investigate."}

{"label": 2.0, "text": "I kinda have mixed feelings about this situation.  I think there is more to this story than we have been told.  I don't think cops should punch anyone, but it did say she was trying to punch and kick him and it might have been his first reaction.  If she's going to act like a man, then what does she expect?  It's still unprofessional of him though, that's for sure.  What did you think?"}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "I think cops should be able to use the force they deem appropriate.  This woman was clearly resisting arrest.  She should have cooperated.  It's not hard not to get punched in the face by a cop."}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "Yeah, I agree.  People act like animals around cops and then get all shocked and offended when the cops retaliate.  It is ridiculous in my opinion.  She's now sued the city for 1 million dollars, by the way, I saw when I googled this."}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "That annoys the hell outta me.  Yeah, I still don't understand why that isn't the first question asked in any of these situations.  \"Well, were they complying with the officer's instructions or not?\"  Why we have so many people who don't feel they need to respect the authority of law enforcement is beyond me.  It's for everyone's safety."}
{"label": 1.0, "text": "Good, I am so glad we are on the same page.  I was worried I would be stuck talking to someone who was defending this woman.  I do not have any sympathy for her.  If she had just complied with what he said, none of this would have happened.  She still could have gotten her issue straightened out ultimately."}
{"label": 1.0, "text": "Yeah, I agree completely.  Believe me, I don't have sympathy for these people.  I have amazing respect for the police and am amazed that they don't hurt people more often.  Dealing with non-compliant riffraff would absolutely infuriate me."}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "Me too, they have an incredibly difficult job and the public does not give them the support they deserve.  In so many of these cases that get national attention, the person seen as the \"victim\" was acting up, resisting the officer, being defiant, and totally causing their own problems"}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "Absolutely.  Not only that, but how many thousands, or tens of thousands or incidents go off completely professionally and without incident, for every one we see where someone gets shot or assaulted.

{"label": 1.6667, "text": "Yeah, again, I'd just lose my mind.  Like, watching high-speed chases pisses me off.  I'd get out of the car and just shoot the person."}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "Yeah people are just so disrespectful and ungrateful really.  It is disheartening.  I might not like getting pulled over for a speeding ticket, but at the end of the day I know they're in the right and I'm in the wrong.  So, I suck it up."}
{"label": 1.0, "text": "Yeah, I feel I've always been treated fairly by the police.  And when I treat them with respect, they reciprocate.  It's not rocket science."}

{"label": 1.6667, "text": "Well, I sure hope that lady doesn't win her lawsuit.  That would set an awful precedent."}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "Yes I totally agree.  You know she's sitting at home just laughing it up.  She punched and kicked a cop, acted disrespectful, and then gets paid."}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "Yeah, it's awful.  But we seem to encourage, reward, and even seek victimhood in our society today.  It's pitiful."}

{"label": 1.6667, "text": "The FBI looked into it to see if it was religious extremism and/or ISIS but they didn't find anything like that. Through the footage though it looked deliberate, and the americans in the cars had no weapons to defend themselves"}

{"label": 1.6667, "text": "Yes, there's definitely a lot of that, unfortunately.  Although I've also known a lot of people who were in the military who got a ton out of it and are thankful for their time in."}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "Really? I feel like I've only met 1 or 2 people that got a ton out of it, but I guess it really depends on what are you live in. Where I am from not a lot of people join the military"}

{"label": 1.0, "text": "What's the difference?"}
{"label": 0.6667, "text": "Well, in terms of officer and enlisted the difference is socio-economic.  In terms of service there are just different attitudes and personality types."}

{"label": 1.3333, "text": "Yeah, I could certainly see that.  Air Force and Navy are sort of more \"office jobs\" and skilled professions (like mechanics).  Marines and Army are a lot more \"military military\" if you know what I mean.  Anyway, all of them can be dangerous, like these guys found out, unfortunately."}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "Yeah, I am sure the guy that shot them did it on purpose. I was reading that Jordan would get weapons from the US and then sell them on the black market, so probably not the best ally to have"}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "That's too bad.  Not a lot of people we can apparently trust in the Middle East.  Oh well, nuke 'em all.  Nice chatting with you.  bye"}

{"label": 1.0, "text": "you can only educate yourself you cant change anyones mind you can only make them think"}
{"label": 1.0, "text": "Yep, that is very very true.  Pretty much everyone I know feels the same way I do though so there's no one's mind to change"}

{"label": 0.3333, "text": "Wow, that is great!  I would love to have livestock but that is so much work.  IA lot of our neighbors do.  I have four children and a fifth on the way so they keep me busy.  Anyway, back to the article, in general it just irritated me."}

{"label": 1.3333, "text": "I was surprised because I did not know the Jewish community felt like that and you?"}
{"label": 0.6667, "text": "Not really.  I'd be interested to know how they feel about Trump now seeing as he's been such a pro-Israel President."}
{"label": 0.3333, "text": "That is a good question."}

{"label": 1.6667, "text": "I think the holocaust put the Jewish community on edge."}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "Yeah, sort of like slavery for blacks. Now everything gets viewed through that prism.  Jewish history has plenty of persecution before that too."}
{"label": 1.0, "text": "The article also said some Jewish people voted for Trump."}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "The thing is though that I don't think Trump himself has ever done anything anti-semitic.  Certainly people who voted for him have."}

{"label": 1.3333, "text": "Maybe, but I don't think his message exactly gets through when it's filtered through the media.  I thought Trump's response to Charlottesville, for example, was the correct one.  Both sides were at fault."}

{"label": 0.3333, "text": "you got me!"}
{"label": 1.0, "text": "Yeah, it wasn't hard.  Any other thoughts on this article?  Do you think our democracy is being threatened by a Presidential election?"}

{"label": 0.6667, "text": "I was able to understand the Jewish people and why they were angry. You"}
{"label": 0.6667, "text": "Yeah, I can definitely see why they were angry"}
{"label": 1.0, "text": "They're probably still thinking about what happened back the nand the history."}
{"label": 0.6667, "text": "Yeah a lot of them survived nazi Germany and know firsthand"}

{"label": 2.0, "text": "To be honest, I am so tired of listening to or reading anything about politics"}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "Yes, it's pretty draining.  I think people would find the world is not quite as oppressive and dangerous as it seems on TV or online if they'd live in the real version of it.  Not to say there aren't serious problems, but the online version is much worse from my experience."}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "It's all sensationalism.   Clintons, Bush's, Obama, and now Trump.   America will never heal because it's all about me, me, me and whatever opinion spews out of the National Media.  Some believe it all."}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "Yes, it's problematic.  I believe the polarization will continue--hard to see how it gets better.  And it's because of how we communicate and interact with each other, not some fundamentally new divide in ideology or something."}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "Exactly.  I honestly wish social media was never born."}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "Yeah, it's pretty awful.  I don't use it (although I'm so asocial in wouldn't do anything for me anyway).  But I think it's interesting because everyone seems to be coming to the same conclusion that it's bad, but they can't stop themselves from using it nonetheless."}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "Agreed.   All these little 10 year olds committing suicide because of social media.   They shouldn't even be on social media.   It's so sad"}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "Yes, the suicide stats are a pretty shocking indictment of social media.  I mean, what else can be the cause?  That's what's fundamentally changed our culture in the last decade."}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "Agreed.  Eventually past my lifetime the world is going to be run by machines and millions of people hungry because there aren't enough jobs."}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "Yes, that's going to be interesting.  What do we do when 50% (or more) of the people in the country are unemployable because of A.I.?  Our economy will presumably have to fundamentally change.  I hope I'm dead before then."}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "Me too.  I worry so much for all the children.   So much for them to overcome for debt, etc."}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "Yes, and they're emotionally set up to struggle to deal with it.  The real problems become far worse because of the anxiety and toxic online environment and all that stuff.  It makes me exhausted to deal with it and I'm old and grumpy and don't care."}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "Well we sound about the same age.   Parents just do everything for the kids today and they know nothing about the world because of it."}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "Yes, I think it's sad that parents think they're doing the right thing by sheltering their children from hardship, when that's really what they need to become strong.  Science is verifying this fact: coddling only makes people LESS capable of dealing with problems."}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "Exactly - that shift took place after my daughter was in her 20s.   I watch her raise my two granddaughters.   She's a bit of a helicopter parent as well but she does at least teach them how to react to bullies, fend for themselves, aspire to be something great, but I feel she's missing the boat on household responsibilities."}
{"label": 1.0, "text": "I guess we all (if we live long enough) have to go through that phase where the world changes and becomes something different from what we've known.  It just seems to be happening faster now, and we're far more aware of it because we know what everyone is doing all the time now."}

{"label": 1.6667, "text": "Yes, I agree.  You'd think that at some point self-preservation would kick in and people would recognize the destruction they're doing to themselves and others.  But I think it's a real addiction, or enough of one that simple reason might not rule the day.  It isn't right now.  It's worrisome, but I guess I take solace in the fact that at some point I'll be dead.  On that cheery note, it's been nice chatting with you.  Always nice talking with reasonable, thoughtful people.  Have a great day.  bye"}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "It is an addiction.   Apple, Steve Jobs, would not even give his kids a phone because he knew the damage it would cause in the development of the frontal lobe of the brain as well as its addictive qualities."}
