            "Same here. I can't believe there are people in this world that are that twisted.",
            "Yea it is crazy that those kind of people exist.  I feel so bad for the girl.",
            "I hope she is getting the support she needs. I don't think she will ever recover from this but i hope she has a good life.",
            "Yeah something like that has to stay with you forever.",
            "I wonder what penalty the parents are going to get.",
            "In the article it said that they got 20 years for it.",
            "I feel like that's too little. They should get life or death penalty. Not only are they pedo, they're involved in incest as well. terrible.",
            "Yeah I think they should have got life too. It happened in 1996 so they are already out of prison.",
            "Wow, i wonder if they've ever tried to contact one another",
            "They had the mother and daughter on the Dr. Phil show together.",
            "I don't think i'd ever be able to forgive my parents if that happened. What about you?",
            "I would absolutely never forgive them. I would want to kill them or at the very least never see or talk tot them again.",
            "Wow i wouldn't kill them but i definitely would not want to talk to them!",
            "Haha yeah I wouldn't actually kill them but I would want to. What do you think about the mother saying that she regrets it and sorry?",
            "I feel like it's already too late. The damage is done.. i would not accept it at all!",
            "Yeah I agree. It makes me wonder why she even agreed to see her mother on the show? Maybe she just wanted some answers.",
            "Yeah probably. Let's hope everything goes well for the daughter in the future. It was nice talking to you! bye",
            "goodbye"

We still get hit sometimes but it's usually not as bad.  Big trees falling on the house is a big threat and very scary but we usually get plenty of advance warning where we could leave if we wanted to.",

            "I can't even go there - not sure what is worse - fire or drowning - I think fire would be quicker",
            "oh yeah, I can't either.  I avoid thinking about negative things like that.  Both of those sound absolutely terrible to me.",

            "Yeah. This article kinda reminds me of the aftermath of 9/11, when they had rescue dogs looking for people and they couldn\u9225\u6a9b find anyone, and the dogs got so depressed rescuers started pretending to be lost just so the dogs would have someone to find. :(",

            "Indeed. Going back to the situation in China, it's kind of alarming that there are over 1,000 mining operations that they can shut down for being outdated.",
            "Also the fact that they overlook maintenance",
            "Yeah. No wonder they're the most dangerous country for mining accidents.",
            "well i think theyre known for lower quality products as well. Judging by this article it seems like their coal mines as well.",
            "Things almost always go poorly when you care more about profit than about people.",
            "Money really is the root of all evil",

            "Awareness, better accountability. There was also a study published recently talking about how bad alcohol abuse on campuses has gotten, and it linked blackout culture with the increase in assaults. So better drinking laws, especially for underage students, sounds like a good idea.",
            "Oh yeah, I am sure that plays a big role.  These kids are clearly way too young to be drinking, they need better enforcement of the laws",
            "Yeah. I think dry campuses are the way to go. Like, if you want to live off campus and drink no one can stop you, but the level of blackout drinking at like frat parties or whatever is a bad idea.",
            "I strongly agree, and I used to drink a lot.  I quit, but I think it is very harmful, especially for young adults and kids, which these 18 year olds are",
            "Yeah. Your brain's not even fully developed until 25 and when you're chugging 7, 8, 9 beers at 18... Yipes.",

            "I do believe the level has increased.  I also think we see it in so many mediums 24/7.  That was not the case prior to the explosive growth of technology options.   Definitely with you on how our anxiety levels are heightened when you hear about it all the time.",

            "I have not - have you?",
            "No, but once when I was visiting my great grandfather in Oklahoma my family got involved in a search for a young kid who had gone missing from his home. They found him but unfortunately he was hanging from a tree in a field. Apparently, he had had a fight with his father.",
            "Oh my!   Gave me cold chills reading that statement.   So many kids choosing to end their life.  We had one last year who jumped off a local bridge because of all the bullying on social media.   Parents have to get involved for this to stop.  Just take the account down.",

            "I have a hard time with pay comparisons by gender. I'm not denying that women on average probably make less, I'm just not sure it's a fair comparison.",
            "Yeah I have a mixedreaction it is sad less are in the work system as a whole",
            "It's not necessarily sad. My husband and I chose for me to be a stay at home mom and for him to work. That is what works for our family. I think we are lucky to be able to have one of us stay home.",
            "I guess, if that works happy there are thing like the stem program",
            "I really don't get what they say about that either, because while I was working, I had a job in science in genetics. At my work and at most of the other universities that we worked with, it seemed to be at least 50/50 men to women and I actually think more women.",
            "I don't now I don't have much experience with it but I know in college there were alot less females vs males in my science and math classes",
            "I think possibly there are more men who are engineers, but I think it's just not a career choice that many women make. If a women does get an engineering degree, she will probably have an easy time getting a job because there are so few women engineers and companies are always trying to add diversity.",
            "that is a great way to consider it maybe in the next generation there will be more and the next complaint is to many women in the field",
            "I just feel like sometimes men and women don't have to have equal representation in jobs. If a woman or a man wants to do a job that is traditionally only done by the other sex, I think they have every right to pursue that and shouldn't be discriminated against. But there are some jobs that most women or most men wouldn't be interested in. Like, I've never seen a female trash person. Most women just wouldn't be interested in that job.",
            "yeah very true the interest is usually why back when they were created it was divided im sure not much is stopping them from getting into a non traditional role",
            "I'm sure worldwide, that there are places where women are discriminated against horribly. I can't imagine living in a place like that.",
            "true i know places like china and syria they are seen as less than",
            "I felt like the article was trying to say how bad the US is though that they have moved down in gender pay equality. I feel like if people really looked at how other cultures are, they would appreciate how good we really have it in the US.",
            "true but im sure thats why the list is created places like africa look at ways we are above them and then us how places lie europe are above us to find ways to improve",
            "Yeah, I guess it gives every country something to strive for.",
            "yeah hopefully more improvements to come for future generations",

            "I was raised by my mother who worked two jobs to support my brother and I. The thought of her being paid less than a man in the same position really boils my potato.",
            "It should.  I ranked pretty high in my organization.  My entire career has been in banking.  I was so proud when I finally got promoted.    I was paid $60,000 and exceeded goals in all areas.  The guy that was in the same position and never met his goals was paid $135,000.   Why is it that continues to happen?",
            "Because discussing your salary has always been considered taboo in corporate culture, when in reality it should be openly discussed among employees to promote equality and fair wages for all workers.",
            "Too many guys out there that still thinks it is all unacceptable that we get the same pay.   Still that mentality of the good ole' boy network.   It's infuriating.",

            "Oh I am so happy for her!    You raised two great children and now doing something she loves.  US being so low on the pay inequality is astounding.  We are \"suppose\" to be the best.",
            "Thanks for the kind words. Yes, we're supposed to be a bastion of freedom and equality but most of western Europe and some of the more progressive Asian nations have been outpacing us with regard to gender equality for some time.",

            "It's true, our public education system has become a national embarrassment in most places. I haven't been inside one in years and frankly i'm afraid of what they look like on the inside these days.",
            "I apologize for hitting the return key too quickly.   My daughter ended up changing my granddaughters to Montessori.   There kids actually learn, experience, have one on one help and concentrate not only on studies but encouraging them to be great human beings.  Public schools now are full of bullies and teaching to a test.",
            "They have been that way for at least the past twenty years. Teaching kids what to think instead of how to think. Also, having been a part of a \"gifted\" program throughout primary school the makes a concerted effort to intellectually segregate public schools.",
            "It does.  My daughter was in gifted.  We called it the \"little yellow schoolhouse\" because it was a building separate from the school.   What an experience and jumpstart both of you had in pursuing goals and futures.",
            "It was an enriching experience to be sure, but having everything come so easily early on made learning healthy study skills and habits a trial to learn once I started college. I was glad to read that the U.S. is improving with regard to educational equality..",
            "Me too.   I am proud of this country and like to see us at least be in the top 10.    Are there other pay equality issues you want to comment on?",

            "Yeah! I hope the families that went through this are okay now though",
            "Indeed. Going back to the problem, I also think it would help if opioids just weren't prescribed as much as they are. Kids can't get ahold of them if the parents don't have them, after all.",
            "That's true. I have a dog and i get terrified when i eat chocolate because i don't want to drop any",

            "I wonder if Opioids are even needed, or if there is some alternate solution to prescribe to people that is more safe",
            "It's hard to say. I expect the solution is less writing it off entirely and just being more judicious when they're handed out. Like how antibiotics are prescribed too liberally and we're creating monster viruses that are immune.",
            "I can agree with that. Let's hope this crisis is dealt with and we have less dying children. It was nice talking to you! bye",

They carry brooms wherever they go to sweep any insects out of their path, but most people crusading for animal rights aren't Jains, they drive cars and eat factory farmed food.

I don't think cops should punch anyone, but it did say she was trying to punch and kick him and it might have been his first reaction.  If she's going to act like a man, then what does she expect?  It's still unprofessional of him though, that's for sure.  What did you think?",
            "I think cops should be able to use the force they deem appropriate.  This woman was clearly resisting arrest.  She should have cooperated.  It's not hard not to get punched in the face by a cop.",
            "Yeah, I agree.  People act like animals around cops and then get all shocked and offended when the cops retaliate.  It is ridiculous in my opinion.  She's now sued the city for 1 million dollars, by the way, I saw when I googled this.",
            "That annoys the hell outta me.  Yeah, I still don't understand why that isn't the first question asked in any of these situations.  \"Well, were they complying with the officer's instructions or not?\"  Why we have so many people who don't feel they need to respect the authority of law enforcement is beyond me.  It's for everyone's safety.",
            "Good, I am so glad we are on the same page.  I was worried I would be stuck talking to someone who was defending this woman.  I do not have any sympathy for her.  If she had just complied with what he said, none of this would have happened.  She still could have gotten her issue straightened out ultimately.",
            "Yeah, I agree completely.  Believe me, I don't have sympathy for these people.  I have amazing respect for the police and am amazed that they don't hurt people more often.  Dealing with non-compliant riffraff would absolutely infuriate me.",
            "Me too, they have an incredibly difficult job and the public does not give them the support they deserve.  In so many of these cases that get national attention, the person seen as the \"victim\" was acting up, resisting the officer, being defiant, and totally causing their own problems",
            "Absolutely.  Not only that, but how many thousands, or tens of thousands or incidents go off completely professionally and without incident, for every one we see where someone gets shot or assaulted.  But we only focus on the few bad events and create a narrative that people are routinely abused or even targeted by cops.",
            "yeah exactly, and the police are made out to be these villainous brutal people who take advantage of others",
            "Imagine what society would be like without police.  We sure take them for granted and expect them to put their own lives in danger while not harming a fly.",
            "Yeah, and all the mess they put up with everyday, just people disrespecting them and resisting them and being general pains in the neck",
            "Yeah, again, I'd just lose my mind.  Like, watching high-speed chases pisses me off.  I'd get out of the car and just shoot the person.",
            "Yeah people are just so disrespectful and ungrateful really.  It is disheartening.  I might not like getting pulled over for a speeding ticket, but at the end of the day I know they're in the right and I'm in the wrong.  So, I suck it up.",
            "Yeah, I feel I've always been treated fairly by the police.  And when I treat them with respect, they reciprocate.  It's not rocket science.",
            "Same here, I've been annoyed before but I've always been treated fairly and with decent courtesy.",
            "Well, I sure hope that lady doesn't win her lawsuit.  That would set an awful precedent.",
            "Yes I totally agree.  You know she's sitting at home just laughing it up.  She punched and kicked a cop, acted disrespectful, and then gets paid.",
            "Yeah, it's awful.  But we seem to encourage, reward, and even seek victimhood in our society today.  It's pitiful.",
            "Yep, we sure do.  You said it better than I.  Well I must go, hope you have a great day.  goodbye",
            "Yeah, have a great day.  Nice chatting with you.  goodbye"

            "Yea, the other soldiers must of been quick to shoot, it just seems so crazy \\",
            "It seems more tragic when soldiers die from friendly fire, but I guess the result is the same.",
            "Yea because the American soldiers were going there to help train them",
            "The families must be distraught.  I'm sure they thought their solider family members were safe just doing training.",
            "Yea definitely, since they were just going to help Jordan out and get killed doing it. I looked into the case via WIKI and the guard that killed them got life in prison",
            "Wow, interesting.  Any idea what his motivation was?",
            "The FBI looked into it to see if it was religious extremism and/or ISIS but they didn't find anything like that. Through the footage though it looked deliberate, and the americans in the cars had no weapons to defend themselves",
            "Wow, that's sad.  I know stuff like that goes on.  I knew a girl in college whose brother was murdered by some of his troop mates in the Army.  That was a pretty awful revelation for them to have to face.",
            "Wow, that is terrible to be killed by your own troop mates. I have 2 sons and would never let them join the army, so much mental illness in the military unfortunately.",
            "Yes, there's definitely a lot of that, unfortunately.  Although I've also known a lot of people who were in the military who got a ton out of it and are thankful for their time in.",
            "Really? I feel like I've only met 1 or 2 people that got a ton out of it, but I guess it really depends on what are you live in. Where I am from not a lot of people join the military",
            "It definitely depends on your service and your job.  I've known a lot of Navy guys who were officers and that's different from say enlisted Marines or Army.",
            "What's the difference?",
            "Well, in terms of officer and enlisted the difference is socio-economic.  In terms of service there are just different attitudes and personality types.",
            "Oh gotcha, I've known 2 people from the air force that did well afterwards and 1 guy from the marines that had a really hard go afterwards... but def different personality types",
            "Yeah, I could certainly see that.  Air Force and Navy are sort of more \"office jobs\" and skilled professions (like mechanics).  Marines and Army are a lot more \"military military\" if you know what I mean.  Anyway, all of them can be dangerous, like these guys found out, unfortunately.",
            "Yeah, I am sure the guy that shot them did it on purpose. I was reading that Jordan would get weapons from the US and then sell them on the black market, so probably not the best ally to have",
            "That's too bad.  Not a lot of people we can apparently trust in the Middle East.  Oh well, nuke 'em all.  Nice chatting with you.  bye",

            "To be honest, I am so tired of listening to or reading anything about politics",
            "Yes, it's pretty draining.  I think people would find the world is not quite as oppressive and dangerous as it seems on TV or online if they'd live in the real version of it.  Not to say there aren't serious problems, but the online version is much worse from my experience.",
            "It's all sensationalism.   Clintons, Bush's, Obama, and now Trump.   America will never heal because it's all about me, me, me and whatever opinion spews out of the National Media.  Some believe it all.",
            "Yes, it's problematic.  I believe the polarization will continue--hard to see how it gets better.  And it's because of how we communicate and interact with each other, not some fundamentally new divide in ideology or something.",
            "Exactly.  I honestly wish social media was never born.",
            "Yeah, it's pretty awful.  I don't use it (although I'm so asocial in wouldn't do anything for me anyway).  But I think it's interesting because everyone seems to be coming to the same conclusion that it's bad, but they can't stop themselves from using it nonetheless.",
            "Agreed.   All these little 10 year olds committing suicide because of social media.   They shouldn't even be on social media.   It's so sad",
            "Yes, the suicide stats are a pretty shocking indictment of social media.  I mean, what else can be the cause?  That's what's fundamentally changed our culture in the last decade.",
            "Agreed.  Eventually past my lifetime the world is going to be run by machines and millions of people hungry because there aren't enough jobs.",
            "Yes, that's going to be interesting.  What do we do when 50% (or more) of the people in the country are unemployable because of A.I.?  Our economy will presumably have to fundamentally change.  I hope I'm dead before then.",
            "Me too.  I worry so much for all the children.   So much for them to overcome for debt, etc.",
            "Yes, and they're emotionally set up to struggle to deal with it.  The real problems become far worse because of the anxiety and toxic online environment and all that stuff.  It makes me exhausted to deal with it and I'm old and grumpy and don't care.",
            "Well we sound about the same age.   Parents just do everything for the kids today and they know nothing about the world because of it.",
            "Yes, I think it's sad that parents think they're doing the right thing by sheltering their children from hardship, when that's really what they need to become strong.  Science is verifying this fact: coddling only makes people LESS capable of dealing with problems.",
            "Exactly - that shift took place after my daughter was in her 20s.   I watch her raise my two granddaughters.   She's a bit of a helicopter parent as well but she does at least teach them how to react to bullies, fend for themselves, aspire to be something great, but I feel she's missing the boat on household responsibilities.",
            "I guess we all (if we live long enough) have to go through that phase where the world changes and becomes something different from what we've known.  It just seems to be happening faster now, and we're far more aware of it because we know what everyone is doing all the time now.",
            "Young people live their life online - every moment documented - it portrays a life that don't live and hurts those that are absent from their postings.   It will be interesting to see it either shift away or continue its destructive path",
            "Yes, I agree.  You'd think that at some point self-preservation would kick in and people would recognize the destruction they're doing to themselves and others.  But I think it's a real addiction, or enough of one that simple reason might not rule the day.  It isn't right now.  It's worrisome, but I guess I take solace in the fact that at some point I'll be dead.  On that cheery note, it's been nice chatting with you.  Always nice talking with reasonable, thoughtful people.  Have a great day.  bye",
            "It is an addiction.   Apple, Steve Jobs, would not even give his kids a phone because he knew the damage it would cause in the development of the frontal lobe of the brain as well as its addictive qualities.",
            "Yeah, that should certainly tell you something.  (Although he was willing to unleash it on the world.)  Anyway, good chatting again.  bye",

            "robots should do a better job hopefully",
            "Yes can't be any worse then what us human do. Sucks jobs will be lost but if it brings better safety i will take it.",

            "did those people even go in? or were they just at the entrance of area 51",
            "I read they went but acting like clowns. But i heard the real gate to 51 after the first gate is 20miles pretty sure no one going run for 20miles to get shredded.",
            "imagine actually rushing in area 51 lol. expect bullets on every inch of your body",
            "All they need is just a tank and before the people get there they go flying into the air one tank is enough no need to waste bullets",

Sure, but so is wanting people to continue to suffer for our own sake.  But I personally don't think the state should be encouraging it in any way.",

What we're talking about is largely a conflict between freedom and order (maybe not the best word for it, but I'll use it anyway).  I believe in freedom of choice.  So do you and everyone.  You believe in order and stability, just like I and everyone else does.  But in some cases I prefer order over security and stability, or vice versa.  Many of our controversial issues boil down to that.  It's unfortunate that people can't see that underneath it all we actually share the same basic values.",

            "I agree. I think that people are very quick to assign blame and knee jerk into a quick fix, but slow to address the roots of social problems that are driving the shooters to behave in such a violent manner.",
            "Yeah i suffer depression and anxiety myself and sometimes i feel like these people just need someone to talk to because they feel alone in the world. There was a recent video where a teacher stopped a shooter and began hugging him and the shooter started tearing up i believe. It was very sad.",
            "Yeah, I actually saw that headline. The stark reality is that even though we are now all superficially tethered together by the world wide web, the world is more alienating and lonesome than ever before. This is done with purpose, because those feelings drive humans to consume in order to fill that void.",

They are poor and do not have the extra cash to buy water all the time.   There was a huge fundraiser that was done.  They raised enough for 2 years of water for them.   Residents were showing what their water was.   It was black sludge.   The county knew it and did nothing.   He was videoed and ran from the cameras.   Makes me very angry.",

            "Every President from the beginning of time lies, lies, lies.  The only one I feel was truthful was Abraham Lincoln.   Sad to type it.",

            "It's been four years for them.  They showed the water that came out of many people's faucets.  It was completely black - Eastern KY is coal companies - they mine all the coal and do none of the reclamation so all the toxic chemicals just go into the drinking water.   Cancer there is 200% higher than national average.",
            "That is very shameful that we allow people to suffer like this in this country.",
            "We are the United States of America on the decline.  Pollution, drinking water, education, housing costs, 1 out of 5 people are hungry - we need to oust everyone every year in the government so it doesn't become about them personally.",
