{"label": 2.6667, "text": "Yes that is why I think giving them aid, with no strings attached, is a good way to do this."}

{"label": 2.3333, "text": "For sure... But it should be worth it to raise them well, it's your responsibility for having kids"}
{"label": 2.3333, "text": "Absolutely, I agree.  I think if you have children you owe them that.  And most people resent their parents enough you'd think they'd try harder with their own kids.  But few do."}

{"label": 2.0, "text": "Hello! To a certain extent. I mean, the recent attacks on synagogues and widespread prejudice against Muslims here in the west doesn't seem to be too far removed."}
{"label": 3.0, "text": "Good point. Maybe I am a bit biased in this. I am not a very religious person. Personally I think it causes more problems in the world. Too many violent acts in the name of God, or Allah, etc. The needless loss of life is quite saddening."}

{"label": 2.0, "text": "Yea. I don't understand it personally. I guess their religion demands them to kill? Or maybe people in power have just twisted it into that meaning. It's just a shame though that people are being persecuted for their beliefs. What does it matter if someone else worships a different being than you? How does that effect you?"}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "From what I understand about these groups is that they have decided to pervert their sacred texts in their interpretation so that they are in fact called to violence. An analog would be the Westboro Baptist church here in the states. If someone is not following the same religious tenets as you it makes them much more difficult to control; you aren't playing by the same rules."}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "Of course it comes down to control. I hate that people ar elike that to eachother tho. But of course I suppose it is in our nature to try to be dominant over eachother. Also as for Westboro, those people disgust me. Absolute degenerates full of hatred."}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "Hatred can be a very powerful force. Unfortunately, it seems that our world is filled with more of it every day; or at least those who are full of hatred have the loudest voices. I'd like to think that these militants truly believe that they are saving peoples souls, but the fact that they would allow them to stay as long as they paid a tax kind of robs the whole process of any mystique. This whole thing is about power. I agree about any self righteous group too. Can't you find something that is actually productive to do with your time?"}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "I just hate that so many people need to suffer. It isn't right, no matter the reason, to persecute and murder people. And using religious views as a cover isn't an excuse.

{"label": 2.0, "text": "Exactly, and that conflict prevents them from making any marked social or political progress at the lower levels of society. The rich get richer and the poor are left to fight each other over the scraps that remain.

Some countries have problems with immigration but others, like Germany, are still accepting people with open arms. The EU in general is still pro immigration. And a country is going to accept those people that would've arrived on the boat. The problem is that there isn't a safe way to transport poor people. They can't simply buy a plane ticket.

{"label": 2.3333, "text": "I think I read that a relative survived the crash, I could've been mistaken. Anyway, I think it probably wasn't street racing. Police are used to estimating speeds due to skid marks and the damages to the vehicles. Although it's possible that the VW was flooring it and lost control before going that fast. And I've found that accidents are semi random and the damage to you has more to do with how you react (less damage if you didn't react). I hit a huge buck at 50 mph or so and completely totaled my car but didn't have a scratch on me. I've been in a minor accident as a passenger and I didn't feel good for a couple days."}
{"label": 2.6667, "text": "Youre right actually Two people out of the five in the van survived, which is everyone except his wife and two children. That's so horrible. I think head on collisions are worse also because the cars are moving in the opposite direction which increasing the impact."}

{"label": 3.6667, "text": "Yeah, basically. I haven't actually been in the situation so maybe there wouldn't be any guilt. From watching movies though, whenever this kind of thing happens, the main character always wishes that they somehow delayed the person who ended up killed. And if they had managed to do so, then the beloved person would still be alive."}

{"label": 2.3333, "text": "I'd say that even in the situations where it's the healthiest for all parties, it's still sad that it came to that.  But I understand your point."}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "I only slightly cared about the article was my parents were divorced when I was around 8 or 9. Like you said though, they are much older than I was, so they should be able to cope better."}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "I'm sorry to hear your parents divorced.  How did you view their divorce then and how do you view it now?  Do you think it was for the best?"}
{"label": 2.6667, "text": "I was crushed by it as a child. As an adult though, I think it was a good idea. I just didn't understand the differences they had as a child. I tried to ignore the numerous arguments everyday."}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "I thought the article was pretty glib about it all, focusing more on the fact that the day is apparently hot.  Then again, it was TMZ."}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "Yeah, stellar journalism lol. The article being brief was probably the point. This is a study afterall."}
{"label": 2.3333, "text": "Not that it matters, but I wonder about the circumstances regarding this type of divorce.  I can understand couples with kids and, you know, 8 years into marriage discovering that they can't keep doing it.  But 27 years, with adult kids.  That I don't readily comprehend.   I guess he got bored or something."}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "I honestly think humans aren't meant for these long term relationships. No matter how great your spouse/girlfriend is, you will tire of her eventually. And the reasons that they annoy you will keep multiplying until you ask yourself what the point of this relationship is."}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "Yeah.  I also wonder how much being on the periphery of fame and fortune influences things.  You see a lifestyle that's more tempting but that you can't really participate in.  I wonder if that leads people to more strongly feel a desire for \"more\" and it's easier to be discontent with what you have."}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "I think fame and money just means more opportunities to cheat. Most guys that have been married 20-30 years probably don't have that many opportunities with attractive younger people."}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "Yeah, there's no question that opportunity is a huge part of that, and attraction in general.  We're sort of attracted to \"best available,\" whoever that is.  When your rich and famous daughters improve your \"best available\" I can see how it would be easy to stray."}
{"label": 2.6667, "text": "It also brings excitement. When an attractive girl comes into your life, whether its because she works with you or she's a friend of a friend, everything gets more exciting. You care about whether you wore nice looking clothes and whether your haircut is on point. The chase is probably the most exciting part of life."}

{"label": 2.0, "text": "Oh, I didn't even consider that you were possibly making fun of me. I'm easy going, even if you had been, I wouldn't care. When people divorce after a long marriage, do you think they have another partner already in mind?"}
{"label": 2.3333, "text": "Certainly could be.  But I think there are other people who are just looking to go explore.  But I'd be surprised if people left a long-term marriage without the intent of finding someone else.  Like, just to go be alone.  That would surprise me."}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "If they just wanted to be alone, they probably grew to detest their long-term partner. What's interesting is that even though my dad hated my mom during the divorce and for years later, now they are on speaking terms. Time heals all wounds I guess.

However in order to win his campaign he decided to ally himself with the Wahhabis. They were known for being particular good soldiers, but there was one catch: they are extremely orthodox and they made him promise that the new kingdom would follow their religious ideology. The new king began trading oil with the west and opened Saudi Arabia to westerners culturally and economically. The Wahhabis did not like this and they have been expressing their frustration about it in many ways for years, sometimes violently."}

{"label": 3.0, "text": "Yes, the king made a promise he could not keep and the rest is history. Western culture has been slowly becoming more popular through trade, media, and now the internet.

If that happens I don't think the west will be insulated from it."}

{"label": 1.6667, "text": "I also thing is it better to set up systems to improve peoples life not  only just give them food or money."}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "Yes yes yes. Because even if you were to give them money or food, the issue will repeat again and again. Especially if there is corruption with the government in those places."}

The camp couldn't be supported and there wren't enough resources there.  I know it became a big problem for the French government.  They had to clear it all out."}

{"label": 2.3333, "text": "Yes, that was my take on it too.  They cleared the camp out!  It was causing too many problems. IT took several attempts and the refugees protested, burned things, threw rocks, etc., the typical rioting behavior.  But eventually they were put out and I think most went to other countries or areas and carried on."}

I head up a Christmas Shoe sponsorship where families adopt a child and the main purpose is to give them a sturdy pair of athletic shoes.    If they want to give something else, perfectly fine.   We give photos to the families and their children get involved after they see their sweet faces."}

{"label": 3.3333, "text": "It's unfortunate, but you're right. That's why I feel like they should be charged with the murder of a police officer.

{"label": 2.0, "text": "would they really be charged with that? That definitely seems hypocritical"}

{"label": 2.0, "text": "You would think that there shouldn't be much evidence to provide. I don't think it would go that far, unfortunately, but I feel like it should. If it were a legit  human, I wonder what would happen from there."}

{"label": 3.0, "text": "There should be. I just hate hearing stories about deaths caused by cars due to negligence. I would love to see that cop do ten years for the death of that police dog. Sorry, this story gets me steamed."}

{"label": 2.6667, "text": "I think so. If his partner was a human, or there was someone handcuffed in the back, and he/she left them there, and they died, everyone would be flipping out. A lot of people don't feel the dog's life is worth as much as a person's, and like I said, we need to set a precedent here to deter problems like this to begin with."}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "I wonder if a policy like that would cause them to stop using dogs altogether. Maybe that would be for the best, idk"}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "Or maybe the police force would be more careful. I definitely see what you're saying, though. I apologize for getting rant-y about the issue."}

{"label": 1.6667, "text": "I'm very liberal in almost all of my views, until it comes to the justice system, then it gets a little more extreme on my end. But yeah, hopefully we can deter behavior like that in the end."}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "ideally it would be possible. The goal should be preventing things like this from happening to begin with however that can be done most effectively"}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "Right. I think if you set down strict rules about procedures with partners/K9 units, then, hopefully, people will pay more attention. Maybe up the punishment for this situation, and they'll definitely be more careful."}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "That makes sense. Maybe there could be specific training too? I'm not sure what the best procedure is for making sure dogs are safe in cars in all situations"}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "Yeah, hopefully all of that is already in place. If not, then it should be. Well, I can't think of anything else. My rant steamed out ha ha"}

{"label": 4.3333, "text": "I think it is absolutely disgusting that a pair of parents could do that to their children personally, and i think she should not forgive them or even be in contact with them for what they did."}
{"label": 3.6667, "text": "Agreed! It's awful. I can't believe they only got 20 years."}
{"label": 3.6667, "text": "That was what i was thinking too, 20 years for scaring your child forever and sexually abusing them. Do you think they have really reconciled with what they did?"}
{"label": 3.6667, "text": "No I think if someone is evil enough to do that, that evil can't go away. They may have buried it or learned to hide it, but that is evil at it core."}
{"label": 4.0, "text": "I agree, it just goes against too many natural instincts that we as humans have. To think that they could look at their child and only see the money that they could gain from it digusts me. And honestly the fact that they even allowed the mother or father to go on the show seems very wrong to me also."}
{"label": 3.0, "text": "Exactly! Yah that seems like a grab for views which is sad on Dr Phils part. He should have focused on the abusee and trying to help her."}
{"label": 3.6667, "text": "Definitely,  i know that their show is about making money and saying that the abuser and abusee will confront each other is good for views but i just think about how their parents are once again profiting from their childs abuse and it just makes my skin crawl."}
{"label": 3.3333, "text": "Ew that's true, I didn't even think about them profitting. That's even worse. I wonder if the daughter will even think it's worth it at that point"}
{"label": 2.3333, "text": "I don't personally see how it could be but if it gets her any closure or helps her then i guess it is fine."}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "yah thats true"}
{"label": 3.0, "text": "What makes me upset is thinking about why she would even do this in the first place. I can only imagine she needs the money from the show or something cause why face these people."}
{"label": 3.3333, "text": "That's true, usually people with childhood tramua such as that struggle with holding steady jobs and their finances. So she probably doesn't want the whole world to know those secrets but now they do because she needs the money most likely."}
{"label": 3.6667, "text": "maybe she has just come to terms with the experience and now sees it as a paycheck that can also help her get some closure. But yeah that makes sense. I also think it is awful how the mother is claiming it was all the fathers idea and she just gave in to his idea after three months, you don't just become okay with the idea of abusing your child."}
{"label": 3.6667, "text": "True a good mother would like divorce or be strongly against the husband/father for even bringing that up in the first place. I would be beyond disgusted if my husband said anything like that"}
{"label": 3.3333, "text": "Exactly or report him to the police or try to get him help, but to give in? Absolutely disgusting and for her to try and just shrug it off as his idea shows she did not learn anything in prison and is still rotten to the core."}
{"label": 3.3333, "text": "Agreed... she is just as at fault as she is. Parents are supposed to protect, not enable or roll over and let evil things happen"}
{"label": 3.3333, "text": "Exactly, it really makes me wonder why she was even released from prison if she did not improve or was not rehabilitated in any way  since she clearly doesn't show true remorse."}
{"label": 2.6667, "text": "Yah... Also why, if she was \"less' at fault, did they get the same sentence length? IMO life would have been enough for both. There's no reason people like that need freedom and to have the opportunity to hurt someone else."}
{"label": 2.6667, "text": "I agree there are certain people who cannot be redeemed and crimes that cannot be forgiven and this is definitely one of them."}

{"label": 2.0, "text": "yes, me two this was such a mass casuality they need to do something"}

{"label": 2.0, "text": "that's true... do you think there are laws in place that will make them pay for this? I hope so"}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "no with s place that you randomly get gas on the side of the road from a truck i bet there laws are iffy"}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "that was kind of my thoughts too.... and those people who that happened too were probably not well off..."}
{"label": 2.6667, "text": "yeah probably very poor lived a not great life then died suffering so sad"}
{"label": 2.6667, "text": "it's awful.... and even worse that with not a lot of laws in place probably, this could happen again and again"}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "yes true i think this should be on the news and some aid should come help and set up laws"}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "agreed. then maybe bigger countries could chime in an help. would you like to keep talking for 5 more turns"}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "yes I would like thar, i think bigger countries have responsibility to guide small poorer countries"}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "i thnk so too because they have the experience"}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "yes and resouces these people dont"}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "exactly. what else could they do to help you think? send like guidance people down"}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "yeah maybe create a task force to aid the social and economical aspect of it"}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "that's a good idea. And we could send them down to prevent events like that not just after them"}
{"label": 1.0, "text": "yup a preventative task force train them and then eventually they will have the tools and knowledge to do it themsleves"}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "that would be great. I wonder if anythign like that is in place already? Probably is but it's not that great"}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "yeah i dont know something needs to be done so this doesnt happen yet again they dont need this death toll with in the society"}

{"label": 2.0, "text": "Yeah. I feel like as soon as I hear any bad news these days I immediately brace for the worst."}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "Same...I wonder what caused it"}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "Oh, I guess it didn't say, did it? That's odd. I feel like a gas leak is usually the suspect."}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "I dont think so.... and yah that would seem most common. I wonder if anyone will sue the landlord. I would haha"}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "Haha, probably depends on what they can afford, honestly. If only eight people were inside it must have been small."}

{"label": 1.3333, "text": "I wonder how the people outside the apartment got hurt. There was an explosion, right? I wouldn't want to get caught in that."}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "Maybe like debris flying or something like that? It said minor so they probably just got knicked with something"}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "Yeah, I think only one person had to go to the hospital, so the explosion must have happened in an area a decent distance from the inhabitants."}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "That would make sense yah, which is good. It probably means the building was like set up like it was supposed to be, safety wise and all"}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "Yeah. I wonder if they had to find somewhere else to live, at least while the investigation's underway?"}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "Hopefully they did, i didn't think about that. I hope there is some sort of law or policy in place that the landlord would have to pay for a hotel for them or something"}

{"label": 1.0, "text": "do you want to go for like three more turns to get the bonus? We could talk about insurance on it and stuff"}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "Sure, that's fine! I know most people have to have rental insurance; does that cover fire damage?"}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "When I had mine it did, and it would cover the cost to replace any damaged or destroyed items"}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "That's good, hopefully everyone involved will have that. I wonder if the people just on the street will get anything for health insurance."}
{"label": 1.3333, "text": "I hope so too... I know a lot of my friends who rent don't. Which is silly cause it's like 10 bucks a month. They probably could get it covered by the property owners insurance"}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "Eep, that's not a good idea. Renter's insurance is super cheap comparatively and can save you a lot of heartache. I had a pipe on the washing machine break one time and it flooded the whole floor. No insurance would've been a nightmare."}
{"label": 1.6667, "text": "Oh yes that would have been awful! Even just for the peace of mind it's worth it. I think that is 15 turns. Are you ready to be done?"}

{"label": 3.3333, "text": "Yup.. and somebody lost a son or grandson"}

{"label": 3.3333, "text": "must have hurt really bad"}
{"label": 3.0, "text": "Yah... I just think a punch is so aggressive. They are trained in how to take people down, and I'm sure a punch to the face is not part of that so much"}
{"label": 2.6667, "text": "true like a taser is usually a go to now"}
{"label": 2.6667, "text": "Yes, there are so many other options"}
{"label": 2.6667, "text": "hopefully they take a better loo at training"}
{"label": 2.6667, "text": "agreed... I hope the officer gets some sort of reprimand"}

{"label": 2.3333, "text": "its been nice talking to you bye"}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "you as well bye"}
{"label": 2.6667, "text": "what did you think about the article? I thought the cop was wrong in this."}
{"label": 3.0, "text": "I do agree that the officer is incorrect here. I can't even figure out why they were detaining her in the first place. Did you see that part? Was it an expired or already served warrant?"}
{"label": 3.0, "text": "She was saying the issue was resolved, so by that I guess she called for help but no longer needed it? Not sure!"}
{"label": 3.3333, "text": "Regardless, I have a friend who was arrested and the only charge was resisting arrest. How does that even work? How can your only charge be resisting arrest? What arrest were you resisting if there are no other charges?"}
{"label": 2.6667, "text": "Yeah its weird how the law works for some and not for others. If she tells you the issue is resolved one would think that's the cue to move on to the next call."}

{"label": 3.6667, "text": "wow thats crazy to watch"}
{"label": 4.3333, "text": "And what makes me most upset is that her kids saw it. I really feel bad for the kids. Look, maybe mom isn't the best if she had a warrant at one point, but those poor kids seeing her get punched in the face."}
{"label": 4.0, "text": "the kids will never forget that image as long as theyre alive"}
{"label": 2.6667, "text": "I am sure of that. I guess since this study seems to be about empathy, what do we feel from the officer's perspective?"}
{"label": 2.0, "text": "Thats a tough one...what do you feel?"}
{"label": 2.6667, "text": "I mean, I understand it is a high stress job. So let's assume there was a clerical error and he sincerely believed there was a warrant for her. If she is denying that, then maybe he did feel she was resisting. I mean, I have trouble with the idea of punching her in the face, but we don't know what the warrant may have been."}
{"label": 2.6667, "text": "I know most cops are good definitely. It's just when these things happen it buries all the good and brings all the bad to the forefront."}
{"label": 3.3333, "text": "I am very much in favor of monitoring the police and I think the same is said for \"my\" side of this - there is a lot of good in the people who want to police to be carefully monitored, but there are a few bad apples that ruin it - like the people who killed the cops in Texas."}
{"label": 3.0, "text": "we need to find a way to monitor them as they have guns and the majority of citizens do not."}
{"label": 2.3333, "text": "I agree, and I think you said before that they need better training?"}

{"label": 3.3333, "text": "I always thought that was the case, but one friend of mine said cops are trained to kill witht heir guns, not to incapacitate - on purpose. This guy was a cop too, so I don't know. Maybe it isn't more training, but better training?"}

{"label": 2.3333, "text": "The Syrian civil war has been going on for eight years and America has been at least tacitly involved since the get go. Anyway, I think that this was just Jordanian soldiers being a little jumpy because of the recent terrorist attack and American soldiers not following protocol."}

{"label": 3.0, "text": "That is a gruesome statement.... hard to think about. But it makes sens"}

{"label": 2.3333, "text": "Me too... That's another reason I hope they can find out the cause, is to give the families some sort of closure or reasoning. It would suck not knowing."}
